00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.870
The accounts of faithful women are found throughout the Bible.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.869
One faithful Christian sister is mentioned by the Apostle Paul at Romans chapter 16 verses 1 and 2.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:18.870
There he mentions Phoebe, who proved herself to be a defender of many, including Paul.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.870
Today, we're blessed to be able to get to know faithful Christian sisters who share something unique.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.870
All of them are wives of brothers who serve as members of the United States Branch Committee.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.869
Sister Snyder, we'd like to get to know more about you.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:36.869
Can you please first tell us how you got the truth?

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.869
I was introduced to the truth by my parents.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:47.869
And Jehovah used the example of my sister and the nurturing love of older ones and the congregations to draw me to him.

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:51.869
Then how did you start in the full-time ministry and then into Bethel service?

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:53.869
Well, it was a bit of a test.

00:00:53.869 --> 00:01:02.869
When I was in my late teens, a friend of mine died and I couldn't understand why Jehovah would allow this to happen to such a kind person.

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:10.870
So an elderly pioneer sister encouraged me to do deeper research on the issue of universal sovereignty.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:22.870
And this not only comforted me, but it caused me to re-evaluate my priorities and to see if I truly believed Jehovah would take care of me if I really put him first.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:32.870
So I started pioneering, put college on hold, and it wasn't long before I was broke and the rent was coming due.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:43.870
And so the next meeting, I quietly put my last $50 in the contribution box and thought, what's it? It doesn't work. I'm going back to school.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.870
But that evening, I learned that Matthew 633 is undeniably true.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:01.870
Jehovah surprised me and cared for all my needs from the most unlikely sources and he hasn't stopped caring for me since.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.870
And then you joined Troy in Bethel service later on, right? Now what assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:18.870
I've enjoyed housekeeping, really enjoyed a lot of assignments within transportation department, and I was one of thousands who worked on the Warwick and Tuxedo construction projects.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.870
Now is the wife of a branch committee member, you have a demanding schedule. Can you explain one challenge?

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.870
Well, like most wives of good shepherds, I would love to have more time with my husband.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.870
That's understandable. So what practical things have you done to deal with that challenge?

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:46.870
Well, prayer, study and meditation has reminded me that we're at spiritual war and we're at war. Our priorities have to change.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.870
So I can't long for ideal circumstances, although they're coming quickly. Right now, it's about advancing pure worship.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.870
And while it's important to maintain a healthy and close relationship with Troy, my primary joy should be in Jehovah.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.870
And then second is remembering the sacrifices that were made for me.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.870
Of course, Jehovah gave up 33 years with his best friend for me.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.870
And also, there were sisters when I was single and pioneering who would invite me over for lots of meals, go out and service.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:31.870
They would even send their husband out and freeze and cold dark nights to fix my car, which broke down often.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.870
So I'm grateful. And the only, the main way I can show this appreciation is to imitate their examples.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.870
Now, with challenges come blessings. What's one blessing you enjoy as the wife of a branch committee member?

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:57.870
Increased peace that comes from having complete confidence in how Jehovah directs and blesses the decisions his organization makes through the governing body.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:17.870
If I were not married to a branch committee member, I may never have known just how much the brothers rely on Jehovah spirit and how much time they spend long periods of time and prayer and how much they deeply, deeply love the friends.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.870
So I'm embarrassed about how much worrying I've done in the past about these things.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.870
But now it's a lot easier to just be supportive and listen obey and be blessed.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.870
Very nice. Now, as you look back on your rich spiritual life in Jehovah's service, is there an experience you can share with us?

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.870
We were visiting a small branch in a developing country that had been ravaged by decades of civil war.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.870
I'd never seen poverty like that before. And one evening, I went into the dining room together dinner for us.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.870
But before getting the dinner, I stopped and talked to a lovely young brother.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.870
At one point, I turned around and noticed that all the food had been taken. And I said, there's no more food.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:11.870
Now, this young brother hadn't eaten either. But he just shrugged and said, it's just hunger and continue to zealously talking about his assignment.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:19.870
Now, this brother was a commuter. Very thin. And so it was likely that he might not eat that night or maybe even the next morning.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:32.870
But the way his face glowed when he talked about his assignment, it was clear that his joy was not based on anything physical or the lack of anything physical.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:40.870
So I really treasure this lesson because it's made me want to more appreciate what I do have currently.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.870
And to imitate his example and focusing on what's truly important.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.870
And I think you told me that he did get some food that night. So we're happy about that.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.870
Thanks for letting us to get to know you and for sharing that experience.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.870
Now, we'd like to get to know Sister Cheryl George's. Sister George's, can you tell us how you got the truth?

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:10.870
When I was 11, my mother started to study. Another sister studied with my two sisters and myself out of the book from Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.870
Two years later, on November 13, 1971, my mother, my oldest sister, and myself were baptized.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.870
How did you start in the full-time ministry?

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:28.870
As teenagers, a pioneer couple assisted us when we temporary or vacation pioneered as it was called then.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.870
That led me to want to regular pioneer after high school.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.870
However, after graduating, I started working full-time.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:45.870
It was at a district convention where the point was made, if you're not pioneering, tell Jehovah why.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.870
Well, I really didn't have a good reason. So I started making plans to work part-time.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.870
It was in September of 1980 when I realized my goal of regular pioneering.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.870
And how did that lead to Bethel service?

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.870
While pioneering, I had the opportunity to assist with the Brooklyn Assembly Hall renovation project on Thursdays.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.870
It was one Thursday I learned of an announcement made at Bethel. Sisters could now commute.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:19.870
So after a while, I turned in my application and started commuting in November of 1987.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.870
But before commuting, I had met Luther. We started to court.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.870
And then later, we were married and accepted as a couple to Bethel.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.870
And what assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.870
While commuting, I worked in a dry cleaning department and continued there after marriage.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.870
For a short time, I worked with the Brooklyn warehouse department.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.870
Then Luther and I received a surprise assignment.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.870
We were asked to assist at the Jamaica branch starting in March of 1995.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:57.870
There I worked in alterations, laundry, kitchen, housekeeping, shipping, and Bethel office.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.870
Then in 2014, the Jamaica branch merged with the United States branch.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:09.870
We were invited to serve back in the United States, first at Patterson, where I worked in audio video services,

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.870
and now at Wallkill in service department.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.870
Now you two have a demanding schedule. Can you explain one challenge?

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.870
Well, many of the assignments that Luther has involves traveling.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.870
So that means that we're away from our congregation sometimes for weeks.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:32.870
It also means that we're not able to get back to our return visits and Bible studies on a weekly basis.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.870
So what practical things have you done to deal with that challenge?

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.870
We found it helpful to let the friends know whenever we would be away.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.870
Many times we would receive a text from them, just saying hi, checking on you, hope you're doing well.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.870
This really helped us to stay connected.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:55.870
What else we did was to invite publishers to go with us on our return visits and Bible studies.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.870
This way, whenever we were away, they could keep the interest going.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.870
That's a good idea.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:06.870
What good habits did you form early in life that help you now as you support your husband?

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.870
Growing up, my mother taught us to be content and to share whatever we had.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.870
One watchtower article stated,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.870
true contentment comes from loving and being loved.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:24.870
We grew up in a loving family and then learning about Jehovah and his love as I grew older

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.870
helped me to find contentment in Jehovah's service.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:37.870
So whatever assignment I have, I tried to be content and view any differences as an opportunity for me to learn about the various aspects,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.870
unique personalities and qualities of my brothers and sisters.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.870
Now, as you look back on your rich spiritual life, is there a memory you can share with us?

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.870
Proverbs 10-22 says,

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.870
the blessings of Jehovah, that is what makes one rich.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.870
I feel as if I had been enriched in so many ways with so many memories.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:04.870
One memory is being able to assist in the form of Jamaica branch for over 19 years.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:11.870
Working together with the brothers was such a unique privilege and really encouraging.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.870
To see the brothers exhibit their faith in loyalty in Jehovah,

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.870
despite various challenging circumstances, was a true encouragement for us.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.870
We made many friends in that assignment and we continued to keep in touch to this day.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.870
That is a nice memory. Thanks for sharing that with us.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.870
Finally, we'd like to talk to Sister Sonny Chicky.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.870
Sister Chicky, can you tell us how you got the truth and then entered the full-time ministry?

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.870
My mother raised me and my two brothers to serve Jehovah.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:46.870
It was difficult for her because my father left the truth and our family when we were very young,

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.870
but she said a very good example for us.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.870
And then because of the encouragement of young pioneers in our congregation,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:01.870
I began regular pioneering in the Pasadena, California congregation after I graduated from high school in 1962.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.870
And how did that lead to Bethel service?

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:10.870
I served in a few other areas where the need was great in New Mexico, Northern California,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:15.870
a special pioneer assignment in Iowa, and then a small congregation in Mississippi.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:23.870
Tom was a Brooklyn Bethelite and he came down to Mississippi to dedicate a Kingdom Hall in May 1981.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:30.870
We met seven months later, we were married, and we were accepted to serve as a couple at Bethel.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.870
Nice. What assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.870
I was a housekeeper for my first three years.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.870
Now I've been in Laundry for 35 years.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.870
I did have a part-time assignment in grounds maintenance for a while,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.870
but now I joyfully serve full-time in the walk-in laundry.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.870
Now you two have a demanding schedule. Can you explain one challenge?

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.870
Meeting so many wonderful friends in our assignments, I like to keep in touch with them,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:02.870
but time is so limited, so I feel that that can be overwhelming at times.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.870
So what practical thing have you done to deal with that challenge?

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.870
Well, I love to write cards and send letters, so that's how I deal with this

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.870
and to be able to keep in touch with my friends, and that really helps a lot.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.870
So what has helped you to be balanced despite your busy schedule?

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.870
I love the March 2016 broadcast that stressed three things.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.870
First is count your blessings.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.870
We are part of an amazing organization that is carrying on the most meaningful work,

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.870
preaching and teaching.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.870
A second is look at the big picture.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.870
When I feel stressed out, I try to put things in the right perspective,

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:44.870
Jehovah's sovereignty first, foremost, and not focusing on myself.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.870
And that helps me to keep calm.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.870
And third was get enough rest.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.870
Without enough rest, I can't think straight and even ordinary activities

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.870
in my routine seem overwhelming or too much.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:59.870
That's very practical.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.870
Now, is there a particular experience you'd like to share with us?

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.870
When I was special pioneering in Iowa, I married a brother who was a pioneer

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:14.870
and then became an elder, and so I continued in the congregation as a regular pioneer.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:19.870
After several years, he became an apostate, and he tried to encourage me to go with him.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.870
But I refused.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.870
The elders made great efforts to help him to recover,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.870
but he was persistent in carrying out his course.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.870
So in time, he separated from me and ended the marriage.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.870
But I felt Jehovah's support in so many ways.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:43.870
One in particular was a couple who would call me often and they would have me to their home,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.870
and they never wanted me to feel alone.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.870
Then another blessing came later when I moved to Mississippi,

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.870
and I became partners with a sister who was 20 years older than me.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.870
She had been in the seventh class of Gilead,

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.870
and she had been special pioneering for 30 years.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.870
So you can imagine she was a tremendous help to me.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:10.870
More blessings came later when I married Tom and began serving at Bethel.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.870
So feeling Jehovah's support at a difficult time

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.870
and experiencing his blessings is unforgettable.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.870
Sister Chikki, thank you so much for sharing that experience with us.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:27.870
In the introduction, we reference the example of Phoebe, that faithful Christian sister.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:33.870
Interestingly, our kingdom song number 137 entitled Faithful Women Christian Sisters

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.870
is based on the description of Phoebe at Romans 16-2.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.870
The lyrics of that song remind us that our Christian sisters show a faithful spirit

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.870
we all can imitate, and that's true of the sisters we interviewed today.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.870
The song concludes with the words,

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.870
Christian sisters, may Jehovah keep you firm in your conviction,

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.870
your prize is drawing near.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:03.870
How we appreciate the example set by all of our faithful Christian sisters.
