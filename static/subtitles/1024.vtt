00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:09.740
During my high school years, I would work at a shipyard as a third-class welder.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.740
It was difficult.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.300
In the summer times, it was real hot on the water, and I just said, wow, if I'm going

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.500
to have to do this for 30 or 40 years, I've got to find something better.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.420
In that period of time, successful meant a good job, a lot of money, comfort, and so I went

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.939
through college, and four years and got an accounting degree.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:39.219
Every time I would get a transfer, I would get promoted, so I went from Africa to Belgium,

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.780
from Belgium to Scotland, Scotland back to the U.S., and then the U.S. to Singapore, and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.859
that was really a big jump.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:55.500
Nice cars, a driver, putting a whole lot of money in the bank.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.460
And every time I would reach one of these goals, my wife and I would sit at the table and

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.740
say, now, now we're going to be happy.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.180
Now we're going to finally start to be able to enjoy this.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.140
But it was like something fleeting.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.939
It just wasn't there.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.939
The emptiness was growing bigger.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.739
It was getting, the hole was getting larger.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.420
We were just perplexed.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.299
We didn't know where to go to find any kind of joy or happiness.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.739
When my daughter, she had a baby shop, it's so baby clothes and small baby furniture.

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:32.780
Her and her husband ran the shop.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.219
So they hired this young girl to help with the store and to help with their children.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.260
But when she wasn't busy with the story with the children, she'd pull open her Bible,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.420
and she would be reading her Bible.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.579
So they asked this young girl, do you know anybody that could study with the two kids?

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.219
She said, I have the perfect people, the perfect couple.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.459
And so they set up a study the following week, one night during the week.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.019
And my daughter called me and said, Dad, can you come to this Bible study?

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:07.379
I don't know these people.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.259
And you just need to be there to make sure it's on the up and up.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.900
And so I came to that first Bible study and I watched it.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.300
I just sat there amazed.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.419
But when the study was over, I asked him, I said, would you not be interested in studying

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.139
with me?

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.460
You know, in the world, you may hit these goals.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.620
But then very quickly after that, you're going way down and then you stay way down.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.419
The truth brings you a constant joy.

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.740
It is there's nothing like it.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.819
It's just complete satisfaction.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.460
You just know now you're doing the right thing.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.740
And it's just changed our whole life now and our whole attitude.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.860
We are just so very content and happy.
