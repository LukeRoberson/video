00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:06.389
At times, world events may highlight the importance of being punctual.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:13.390
In May of last year, a wildfire overtook the Canadian city of Fort McMurray in the province of Alberta.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:21.390
The brothers and sisters there benefited from promptly following the direction they had received from their local congregations.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:34.939
There was a local needs part, and we'd try to do it every year.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:38.939
And this year it was in the perfect time because the next week we had the fire.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:43.939
And when the brother was reviewing, he was saying it was a high fire hazard year.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:50.939
So be prepared and it was nice, the brothers were so obedient and took that to heart and we're ready.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:56.939
It happened so quickly from being fine and safe to, we got to get out of here.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:02.939
We started to hear the municipality saying there are mandatory evacuations for different neighborhoods.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:09.939
So within noon, two o'clock, four o'clock, 90,000 people are in motion.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.939
When you were standing outside, you could hear the helicopters going, the sirens going, the smoke was so thick and intense.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.939
Both the lifts and the right were all in flames. It was totally in flames.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.939
It was chaotic.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.939
People running to their cars, seeing and looking at the big cloud of smoke approaching them and just the fright in their eyes.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:39.500
He just came to mind during the local needs, the brother said, if a case of emergency you have to fall a direction.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.500
Listen to the local authorities and listen to your local elders.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Each elder for the field service groups had a care for a small amount of people.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.500
I was calling all the brothers and sisters that I can find out where they were, if they were safe.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.500
Every group where we see her knew exactly where everybody in this group was at all times.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.500
One brother came to help my wife and the kids to evacuate while I was at work.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.500
So I felt very indebted to this brother that he acted on my behalf to get my family to a safe place.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.669
To see the brothers okay and calm, it makes me calm.

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:28.669
It's all gone and it went away overnight.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:37.289
If we are to put our trust in such things, where is it now?

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:42.289
Although we've lost all this, our relationship with Jehovah, we haven't lost that.

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:51.020
You can't salvage nothing. Everything is gone.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.020
Gone, everything is gone.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.020
Yeah, this is our basement.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.020
People always asking us like, did you lose your home and we're like, yeah, we did.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.020
Seeing how quickly things can go, things can disappear.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.020
It helps to appreciate the things that are most important.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:21.379
Not only did we have our own lives, but we still have our budget sisters there with us.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:29.379
When we escaped and moved to Edmonton, which is about four and a half hours right from here,

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.379
the friends opened their homes to us and in the middle of the night, 2.30 a.m. and welcomed us.

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.379
They gave us food, they gave us clothing, they gave us a place to stay.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.379
That kind of hospitality really touched our heart.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:57.030
We realized that we hadn't missed anything.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.030
Some of the friends we have been seeing them since the disaster, I'm okay.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.030
And to meet the friends again, you know, about a month and a half after the disaster,

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.030
at the convention was really, really encouraging.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.030
We see brothers that are working in different departments here at the convention

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.029
and also with the disaster relief committee who have no home to go back to.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:22.029
Yet they're so concerned about someone else that they don't even think about what they've really lost.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:29.029
Although we've lost everything materially, we have everything spiritually.

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:32.029
What is gone is gone.

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:36.029
What is important is our lives and our relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:36.029 --> 00:05:00.939
The local needs part proved very helpful for our brothers and sisters in Fort McMurray.

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:08.939
The part included direction about having a go bag and keeping the gas tanks of their vehicles full.

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.939
Because of the distance to the nearest town and the heavy traffic during the evacuation,

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.939
having a full tank of gas proved to be very timely advice.

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:24.939
Instead of procrastinating, our brothers and sisters in Alberta followed the direction to their benefit.
