00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.449
Well, as we can see, our Scripture text for today, Proverbs 1, verse 5, highlights listening,

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.250
a wise person listens and takes in more instruction.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.929
Today, we often equate learning with reading, because there is an abundance of books.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:28.609
But why listen? Well, in Bible times, there were a few copies of the scriptures,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.369
and they had to be made by hand. So listening really was the main way to learn

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:43.490
about Jehovah and His Word. So likely for this reason, the English edition of the New World

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:52.850
translation, expressions like read or read, appear only about 69 times. In contrast,

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.810
if we look up the words here, or hearing, or listening, we put together the various forms

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:08.290
of those words, and we get over 1200 times that those are found in the English New World translation.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.810
So even though today we have an abundance of books, much of what we learn, though, is still

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.090
by listening. For example, a young child, how does a young child learn a language?

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.650
Well, you don't hand a child a grammar book and say, here you go, no, the child learns by listening

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.049
and absorbing sounds, and their youthful brain is made in such a way as if they begin to translate

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.489
those sounds into meaningful expressions, words, and phrases, and so forth. So we stop and think

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:52.769
then if listening is so important, what's involved in listening well? Well, today we'll take a

00:01:52.769 --> 00:02:00.290
look at three basic things that will help us become better listeners. First of all, it's important

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:09.169
to remember that listening is connected with obedience in the Scriptures, and obedience saves

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:19.090
lives, as we know. Second, we'll discuss how listening involves active listening. We'll see what

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.449
that means. And finally point number three, we will discuss how listening involves manifesting

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:35.250
godly qualities. So let's begin with point number one, listening involves obedience. How is that so?

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:45.090
Well, in the Bible, we noticed that listening can be life-saving. We learned from Jehovah's instructions

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.009
to Moses before the 10th plague came upon Egypt. Very specific instructions had to be conveyed to

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:59.250
Moses, all about they're putting the blood on the doorposts and so forth. Moses in turn had to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.770
verbally explain those instructions to the older men of Israel who in turn explained those instructions

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.409
to each household. Well, how did it go? Well, the Bible tells us very clearly all the sons of Israel

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:24.689
did just as Jehovah commanded. They did just so. So once again listening involved lives, obedience saves

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:33.409
lives. Well, this account highlights then the importance of listening in our time as well.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.770
The book inside on the Scriptures says that in the Hebrew Scriptures the thought of obedience is

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:50.370
expressed by the word Shamah, which basically means to hear or to listen. For example, in Genesis

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.370
chapter 22 and verse 18, in speaking to Abraham, Jehovah says, all nations of the earth will obtain

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.449
a blessing for themselves because you listened to my voice. Well, what Jehovah meant was essentially

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:15.650
Abraham obeyed Jehovah's voice as well. Jesus also stressed the importance of listening. How often?

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:24.850
Well, at least seven times in the gospel accounts, Jesus uses the expression, let the one who has ears

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:33.970
listen. Let's look at just one example of that in Luke chapter 8. Notice Jesus here gives an

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.529
illustration about different kinds of soil. We'll take a look at verse 8, Luke 8 and verse 8.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.129
It says, but others fell on the good soil and after sprouting, they produced 100 times more fruit.

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:59.970
As he said these things, he called out, let the one who has ears to listen, listen. Well, did the

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:08.129
disciples take his advice? Did they really listen as Jesus explained this parable? Well, we don't have

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:19.009
to guess. Notice verse 9. But his disciples asked him what this illustration meant. That brief

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:25.649
sentence indicates the disciples were engaged. They wanted to know more. Well, we call that

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:32.930
active listening, if you will, when you ask questions. So Jesus commended them for that.

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:42.050
Notice in the very next verse, he said, to you, it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.769
the kingdom of God. And then he went on to explain the meaning of that illustration.

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:57.250
So what can we learn from Jesus' disciples about listening? Well, in addition to what we've just

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.089
discussed earlier about obedience, this time we learned that by asking questions, they showed

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:10.529
they were actively listening, as I mentioned. Active listening is better than simply passive listening.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:18.209
So how can we do so? We have abundant opportunities in Jehovah's organization to listen, don't we?

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:24.129
At our meetings, morning worship, such as we're having today. Also in our ministry, we listen to

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:30.850
householders and so forth. Well, you might want to note a very nice reference about what's involved

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:38.290
in listening. It's in the ministry schoolbook page 13. There's a box. It's called tips for

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:46.449
effective listening. And it lists seven different points that help us to listen actively. Among them,

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:53.970
pray to be able to concentrate, keep your eyes on the speaker that helps us stay engaged

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:02.209
with his message. Look up the scriptures as he cites them. Mentally respond, when perhaps in

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:09.170
a discussion like the watch tower, mentally respond to what the questions are after. If the comment

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:16.209
is being given, pay attention to the comments. Take brief notes. You notice the expression

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:21.250
brief. We don't want to try to write a manuscript. We'll never be able to keep up. But if we take brief

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:30.370
notes, it has a beneficial effect. We will remember better what is being discussed. Why? Because the

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:39.970
very act of taking notes causes us to focus on the material. One young man named Michael 16 years

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:45.649
of age, he says, when I take brief notes, it keeps my mind on track. So even if we don't look at

00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:53.009
those notes again, we do ourselves a big favor by taking brief notes. It keeps us focused.

00:07:53.889 --> 00:08:00.449
Well, those are some of those seven points. But besides actively listening, the disciples

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:07.970
manifested something else. What was that? Well, let's look at Luke now, chapter 8 again, and this

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:17.730
time, verse 15. It says, as for that seed that is sold on the fine soil, these are the ones who

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:25.889
after hearing the word with a fine and good heart retain it and bear fruit with endurance. You

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:31.889
notice that Jesus used an expression here, hearing the word with a fine and good heart.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:39.090
Well, a fine and good heart is point number three in our discussion. A person with a fine heart

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:47.490
normally manifests good Christian qualities. One of them is humility. Our scripture text for today,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:55.250
Proverbs 1 verse 5 is a classic example of humility and action. A wise person listens and takes

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.769
in more instruction. Why would a person who is already wise continue listening, continue taking

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:06.450
in more? Well, because he's humble. He realizes never going to know everything about everything,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:14.129
only Jehovah does. But by continuing to listen, he shows humility. We can do the same when we're at

00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:20.129
Christian meetings, here at Morning Worship each day. The more we listen, the more we learn.

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:27.570
Realistically, though, of course, it's a challenge to concentrate, to pay attention at our meetings,

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:34.690
morning worship. There are distractions. There are distractions. How often perhaps if you had a text

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:39.009
show up right in the middle of a meeting and you're trying to concentrate, but all of a sudden now

00:09:39.009 --> 00:09:47.250
you're divided? Well, this highlights the value of having a fine heart. Another was not only

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:54.769
humility to learn new things, but also to exercise another guiding quality, self-control,

00:09:54.769 --> 00:10:00.370
self-control. It takes self-control to ignore distractions, texts or emails or whatever.

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:09.490
But if we do so, if we manifest qualities like this, notice the benefit Jesus says and Luke 8 verse 18.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:19.730
He says, therefore, pay attention to how you listen for whoever has will be given more.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:26.529
In other words, we'll be blessed with more knowledge, more understanding. So as it says in Proverbs

00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:34.049
chapter 1 verse 5, if we're listening, paying attention, why we'll be wise in a godly way,

00:10:34.929 --> 00:10:45.090
we'll be a person who truly listens and who truly benefits.
