00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.820
Welcome to this month's edition of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.820
Here are a few highlights from our program.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.820
Bill lived for music, but it left him feeling as if something was missing.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.820
We'll learn what helped him to have a truly meaningful life.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.820
Good friends are a blessing, especially during hard times.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.820
We'll learn how to build strong friendships that endure.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.820
And our new song reminds us of the many reasons we have to be joyful.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.820
It will make you smile.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.380
This is J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:01:11.530
No doubt every one of us at one time or another has faced a discouraging situation.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.530
Really, no one is immune from discouragement.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.530
This feeling may last for a day or two, and then subside or it might last longer.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.530
What can cause us to be discouraged?

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.530
The Watchtower Publications Index lists over 20 factors that can contribute to discouragement.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.530
Some of these are another's conduct, what someone did or didn't do that disappointed us.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.530
Problems in our congregation, feeling inadequate, our own personal failures,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.530
what we've done or failed to do, health problems, and loss of privileges.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.530
There are ever so many things that can cause us to be downhearted.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.530
Even the fact that we are discouraged can be discouraging.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.530
We feel guilty for being discouraged.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.530
Here's the good news. We're in good company.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:28.530
Some very prominent and faithful servants of Jehovah mentioned in the Bible have been discouraged.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.530
Moses became so discouraged over the complaints of the Israelites that he said to God,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:45.530
please kill me right now. Rebecca was so distressed because her son Esau married pagan women.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.530
She told her husband, Isaac, I am disgusted with my life.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.530
Yes, family situations can cause discouragement.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.530
David was tormented by his sins.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:14.530
As Psalm 51 3 he wrote, I am well aware of my transgressions and my sin is always before me.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.530
Our mistakes can weigh us down.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.530
Jeremiah felt so discouraged by the opposition, ridicule, and apathy he met up with.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:35.530
He told himself, I am not going to make mention of Jehovah and I will speak no more in his name.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.530
Yes, poor results in the ministry can discourage us.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:51.530
The Apostle Paul, frankly admitted in Romans 724 and 25 that he struggled against sinful tendencies.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.530
At times he felt miserable over this conflict.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:05.969
He said, miserable man that I am, who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death.

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:14.969
Faithful men and women faced discouraging circumstances in the past and so do we.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:21.970
Discouragement is a part of life in this system. We should expect it.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.970
Yet it's important to consider how we view discouragement.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:39.970
Do we view ourselves as helpless victims of discouragement and let ourselves sink into a quagmire of despair and self-pity?

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.970
Or do we view discouragement as an enemy that we must fight against?

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.970
We easily recognize that feelings of pride, selfishness, envy, and such things are enemies.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:03.970
We battle against these bad feelings. We don't want them to erode our faith or gain a foothold on our personality.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.970
Yet sometimes we may yield all too willingly to discouragement.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.970
Why is this dangerous?

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.970
Please read with me, Proverbs 2410.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:27.970
If you become discouraged in the day of distress, your strength will be meager.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.970
Did you note the reason why we must fight discouragement?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:41.970
What do Proverbs 2410 tell us will happen if we allow a day of distress to discourage us?

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.970
We'll lose our strength.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:53.970
Yes, discouragement can drain us of our spiritual, mental, emotional, and even physical strength.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.970
And what can happen if we lose our strength?

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.970
We can lose our enthusiasm for the truth.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.970
We may lose interest in prayer or in personal study.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.970
We could slack off in attending meetings.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.970
We could develop coldness toward our brothers.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.970
Our zeal for evangelizing can weaken.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.970
We may even want to give up.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.970
We don't want any of those things to happen to us, do we brothers?

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.970
How then do we fight and defeat discouragement?

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:38.279
Discouragement is a feeling, an emotion.

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:42.279
What causes feelings or emotions?

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:54.279
An article entitled Negative Emotions, Can You Overcome Them, was published in the October 8th, 1992, awake.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:07:15.279
This article didn't discuss serious cases of depression that may have a medical or physical cause, such as a disease, a reaction to toxins, medications, nutritional deficiencies, allergens, hormonal problems, or bipolar disorder.

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:27.279
Rather, it discussed how to overcome moments of discouragement, like the temporary day of distress mentioned in Proverbs 24-10.

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:35.279
Under the subheading, we can control our thinking. It stated this.

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:45.279
Many who work in the field of mental health maintain that our feelings are caused by our thoughts.

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:54.279
It's been said that you cannot experience a feeling without first experiencing a thought.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:08:06.279
So then, feeling discouraged isn't always the situation that we face, but the negative thoughts that we have about the situation.

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:15.279
The first step then in fighting discouragement is to identify the negative thoughts.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:28.279
Sometimes we say that we have a train of thought. It means we have a series of thoughts that lead to a certain conclusion or destination, if you will.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:35.279
Now, imagine yourself getting on a literal railroad or subway train.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:47.279
Soon you realize you're on the wrong train. It's taking you to a place you do not want to go to. What do you do? Do you stay on the train all the way to the wrong destination?

00:08:47.279 --> 00:09:01.279
Of course not. No, you get off that train at the very next station. But what do you do next? You switch to the right train.

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:13.279
Now, figuratively speaking, if you realize that your mind is getting on a train of negative thoughts as leading to discouragement, can you get off that train?

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:25.279
Certainly, but you need to switch to the right train of thought that will lead you to a peaceful state of mind. That's the key.

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:33.279
We need to replace negative thoughts with positive building spiritual thoughts.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:46.279
Keeping our thinking on the right track is not going process. Notice how the Apostle Paul put it in Ephesians 4.23.

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:54.279
And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude.

00:09:54.279 --> 00:10:08.279
Do you see how Paul confirms that we are in control? We can change how we think. And because we're imperfect, we have to make these changes continuously.

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:28.279
It's not a losing battle. Jehovah has given us powerful weapons to help us make our minds move in the right direction, his powerful word, his mighty Holy Spirit, the power of prayer, and healthful spiritual food from his organization.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:42.279
Let's consider some negative thoughts that may lead to discouragement. Then we'll consider a building, positive thoughts that help us fight discouragement.

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:57.559
You had a bad day. You said or did the wrong thing and you regret it. It's become a day of distress. The thought enters your mind. I'm worthless.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:11:08.559
That's the discouragement train where you continue to stay on this train of thought, taking you to the state of discouragement.

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:23.559
Remember, you have a choice. You can reject it. Instead of giving in to that negative thought, you could say to yourself, wait a minute, stop.

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:37.559
That's not right. Just because I made a mistake. Does not make me worthless in Jehovah's eyes? He's told us that he knows that we are dust and he's merciful.

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:50.559
And Jesus said that not one sparrow that has fallen to the ground is forgotten by God. And that we are worth more than many sparrows.

00:11:51.559 --> 00:12:09.559
Yes, Jehovah views me as precious. How pray about this. And I'm sure he'll help me not to make that mistake again. Tomorrow will be a better day. Thank you, Jehovah.

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:33.559
Let's take a second example. A brother has said something quite unkind to you. This has become a day of distress. The thought comes to your mind. How can a brother behave like that and still be in good standing? He's not a good example.

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:51.559
Why don't the elders do something about it? Now that discouragement, speaking, calling for us to get on board, if we stay on that negative train of thought, we could lose our spiritual strength.

00:12:51.559 --> 00:13:08.559
But we still have a choice. What we replace those negative thoughts with positive ones. We could get our mind on a positive track by saying to ourselves something like this.

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:32.559
Well, that was an unkind thing for him to say. This is not like him. Maybe my brother just had a bad day. He's as imperfect as I am. I've said unkind things too at times and have regretted it. He's probably feeling the same way.

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:55.559
I remember Colossians 3.13 says that we must continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely, even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Well, he has given me a cause for complaint.

00:13:55.559 --> 00:14:16.559
But it says Jehovah has freely forgiven us. He has certainly forgiven me countless times. No, I'm not going to allow this to ruin our relationship. How can I help my brother? I'll pray for him.

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:24.559
And I'll pray for myself that I don't hold feelings of resentment in my heart.

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:47.559
Let's consider a third example. After years of hard work at your place of employment, your position has been terminated. You've lost your job. It's a day of distress. You're filled with anxious negative thoughts. How will I care for my family? What will the future bring?

00:14:47.559 --> 00:15:07.129
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to me? Where will this train of dark negative thoughts lead you? Certainly, discouragement will set in and you will become spiritually weak and exhausted.

00:15:08.129 --> 00:15:35.129
You still have a choice. You can replace those negative thoughts with thoughts such as these. Okay, I've lost my job. What should I do? Stop serving Jehovah? No. Jesus said that we should not be anxious over material things because Jehovah will provide if we keep his kingdom first in our lives.

00:15:35.129 --> 00:15:46.129
He also said to keep our lives simple. You know what? There are things that we don't need. So that's what we do.

00:15:46.129 --> 00:16:03.129
Simplify our life and do more in Jehovah's service. Jehovah promises never to abandon us. I'll throw my burden on him and I know he'll help us make the right decisions.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:20.129
Brothers, we're living in the last days of this system of things. We'll have our days of distress. Sometimes these come because of our own imperfection or the imperfection of others.

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:42.129
But we also realize that the devil wants to discourage us. Revelation 1217 tells us that Satan's great anger is directed toward those who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness concerning Jesus.

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:55.129
The devil will try to take advantage of situations and problems that we face to fill us with discouraging thoughts and drain us of our strength.

00:16:55.129 --> 00:17:21.130
Now we stand at the very threshold of the new world. Let's fight discouragement with all the weapons Jehovah gives us. Continue to steady God's word, making it a part of your daily life. Pray incessantly to Jehovah for his powerful spirit. Keep close to his organization.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:33.130
God has promised to give us the victory. Fearlessly, we join in repeating Paul's words at Philippians 413.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:55.920
For all things, I have the strength through the one who gives me power. Our first video is the experience of I know Ketma. As we'll see, she endured many days of distress for being one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.920
Notice what she did to remain faithful and joyful.

00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:21.119
When I was young, my father wrote to me the Bible verse, your word is a lamp to my foot and a light for my path. And he said, keep that always in mind. Remember God's word and live by it.

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:38.309
I was born in 1929 in the city of Furu, Estonia. My family was religious and my God-fearing parents lovingly cared for me and provided everything that a child would need.

00:18:38.309 --> 00:18:54.339
When my father learned the truth, he gave each of us a Bible and we began to study it together. My father was arrested in the summer of 1948.

00:18:55.339 --> 00:19:05.339
Estonia was now under the Soviet regime, but he was still working as a school teacher. The local Department of Education asked him to come by.

00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:19.089
He went dressed in summer clothes and wearing sandals, and he never came back.

00:19:19.089 --> 00:19:30.430
At midnight, we heard someone banging at the door. We opened it and soldiers came in and demanded our passports.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:36.430
We put the passports on the table and they just said, you are under arrest.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:48.430
Pugged a prison in Tallinn was a place everyone was afraid of, and I was afraid too.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:57.430
I remember that I was taken down the steps to the basement, to a long corridor. There was nothing in the cell besides a bench.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.950
They slammed the door shut and that is when I became a little scared.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:22.460
But then I prayed to Jehovah to help me and a sense of peace came over me. I lay down on the bench and fell asleep.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:28.460
I was given a 10-year prison sentence as an enemy of the state.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:38.039
A year later, we were transferred to Russian prison camps.

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:44.039
Spiritual food was hard to get. It couldn't be sent by mail.

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:53.019
But the angels somehow still provided for us and we always had something.

00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:58.019
Even a single verse or a good thought can help in prison.

00:20:58.019 --> 00:21:08.019
In any case, God's word should be in our heart. We should never forget it, even if we can only remember one verse.

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:18.430
At one point during my sentence, I was allowed to live outside the prison camp.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:24.779
One witness family took me and two other sisters into their home.

00:21:24.779 --> 00:21:30.779
Living outside meant that the guard was not watching us all the time.

00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:39.779
We were able to spend time together and we could preach a little. We even went from house to house.

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:44.779
Eventually, I moved to a dormitory because there was not enough space.

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:51.880
And it also meant that the literature could be stored at my place.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:59.880
Because if they arrested me, it wouldn't be a big deal. But if the brother was arrested, it would be much worse.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:11.750
They raided my place one night. They put all the literature on the table and asked me where I got it.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:17.750
I said, the angels are bringing it to us and feeding us all the time.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:25.099
So I was sentenced to another two years for possessing literature.

00:22:25.099 --> 00:22:31.099
Then for the first time, I heard that Jehovah's Witnesses were officially banned.

00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:38.099
What a good feeling it was to be recognized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. That really gave me joy.

00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:46.720
I saw Jehovah's help and that things were never too hard for me to bear.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.720
If things were getting too difficult, something would always change so that I could cope.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.720
There was always that feeling that someone was looking after me.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:03.309
I never felt alone or abandoned.

00:23:03.309 --> 00:23:08.309
If only we could be faithful all the time, then we would also be happy.

00:23:08.309 --> 00:23:13.309
But sometimes we fail and so we lose joy.

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:17.309
Faithfulness gives joy.

00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:24.309
In prison, you can stay faithful if you don't leave Jehovah and if you don't forget to pray.

00:23:24.309 --> 00:23:28.309
And if you always remember why you are there.

00:23:28.309 --> 00:23:32.309
You are there because you are on Jehovah's side.

00:23:32.309 --> 00:23:36.309
I was not a thief. I was not a killer.

00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:42.309
But I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses and that is worth being in prison for.

00:23:42.309 --> 00:23:55.859
If you are enduring persecution or any sort of trial, you will want to remember what helped Sister Ekma.

00:23:55.859 --> 00:24:01.859
She kept herself spiritually nourished even when literature was scarce.

00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:04.859
She cherished God's Word, the Bible.

00:24:04.859 --> 00:24:09.859
She fought discouragement and anxiety with prayer.

00:24:09.859 --> 00:24:15.859
And she stayed close to fellow believers, something we all need to do.

00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:27.259
Strengthening relationships with our brothers and sisters is especially important as we move deeper into the last days.

00:24:28.259 --> 00:24:51.279
In our next segment from our series Lessons from the Watchtower, we'll learn how to build strong friendships.

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:55.279
Friends give me help when I need them the most.

00:24:55.279 --> 00:25:01.279
They made me laugh. They give me that whole assistance whenever I need them.

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:04.279
They're just a real source of joy in my life.

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:14.279
When I see my dear friends going through difficult times but still serving Jehovah, that really encourages me with my trials.

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:19.279
Friendship just enhances and enriches a person's life.

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:25.279
I don't think that friendship is something that I find unnatural.

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:31.279
I'm shy by nature. I'm hesitant by nature. I feel inadequate by nature.

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:37.279
In my mind, Baruch was simply Jeremiah's secretary.

00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:44.279
I'd never considered that after spending so much time together, it would have allowed them to go closer with friends.

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:52.279
When I studied the article about Jeremiah and Baruch, it made me reflect on friendships that I have.

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:58.279
But when you work together for Jehovah, it takes your friendship to another level.

00:25:58.279 --> 00:26:09.009
Jehovah's people will have a depth and a dimension to their friendships which will not be shared by those who are not serving Jehovah.

00:26:09.009 --> 00:26:13.009
In the article, I really love to the point about communication.

00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:23.019
Being open with others, it allows them to be welcome with you. That just allows a friendship to flourish.

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:27.019
I can have a very bad view of myself.

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:34.019
I appreciate the reminder that you will see the bad side of any friend. That's just normal.

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:45.430
But good friends remind you of your good side that is like Jehovah talking and reminding me how much I'm loved by him.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:54.430
I'd heard that Keith and older brother was returning to Britain for some medical treatment. He was much loved, deeply respected.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:27:00.430
You try and picture and imagine what's going through his mind, his fears and anxieties.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:08.430
I felt very inadequate, but I realised it would be the loving and kind thing to do to speak to him.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:14.430
So we spent some time together, we talked. I felt honored just to say a prayer with someone like that.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:21.430
I was really touched by Keith's response. He clearly deeply appreciated that.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:27.430
And I felt thrilled to have done just a little something that helped that supported him.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:35.059
I've worked with someone that I never expected to become very close to.

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:46.950
Charlotte, she's the opposite to me, but I came to realise quite early on she's an amazing listener.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.950
Charlotte is more than a friend. She's now a family.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:28:00.680
I love my family very, very much. At the moment I am the only one in my family who is one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:15.019
But I've never felt I was truly alone. Jehovah always provided brothers, sisters, mothers, you know, uncles, aunties. He's always given me everyone I needed.

00:28:15.019 --> 00:28:21.019
I feel I've had a lesson powerfully reinforced of the blessings of genuine friendship.

00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:28.269
And we make an effort just to give Jehovah a little something that you can add is blessing.

00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:36.269
In my experience, the person you don't expect actually turns out to be a very special friend.

00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:42.269
When you work with different brothers and sisters, I really appreciate they are gifts from Jehovah.

00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:52.140
Working hard for Jehovah and being genuine, that will attract other brothers and sisters.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:57.140
We will never forget the friendships that we make right now.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:02.140
Jehovah will use those friendships to help us through the great tribulation.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:25.430
Those helpful suggestions appeared in the November 2019 issue of the Watchtower.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:36.430
That article emphasized the importance of forging strong friendships now before the end of the system comes.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:48.430
During the great tribulation, God's enemies may try to disrupt our unity, but we can be confident that nothing will break our bonds of love.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:55.430
Our friendships will last not only through the end of the system, but for all eternity.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:30:02.059
For many years, we've published the life stories of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:08.059
Have you ever wondered what happened since their stories appeared?

00:30:08.059 --> 00:30:10.059
How are they today?

00:30:10.059 --> 00:30:15.059
Well, we're pleased to introduce a new series.

00:30:15.059 --> 00:30:18.059
Where are they now?

00:30:19.059 --> 00:30:23.059
In our first episode, we'll hear from Bill Malaine.

00:30:23.059 --> 00:30:29.059
History appeared in the Awake magazine some 35 years ago.

00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:36.059
At that time, Bill had made a major decision that would affect the course of his life.

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:39.059
How has it turned out? Let's see.

00:30:39.059 --> 00:31:09.730
Music expresses things that you can't express them on the other way.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:18.740
It is so powerful.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.740
It's just an amazing gift.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:26.529
Before I got the truth, I lived for music.

00:31:26.529 --> 00:31:33.529
I played hard and heavy rock and roll in bars and clubs around the New York City area for many years.

00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:38.529
To me, I just found it to be a very depressing atmosphere.

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:43.529
But then I developed a love for classical music, and I would practice six hours a day.

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:46.529
I applied to the Juilliard School for the Performing Arts.

00:31:46.529 --> 00:31:49.529
I was accepted, but I did not attend.

00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:55.970
But deep inside, something was missing.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:59.970
My life changed drastically on February 16, 1973,

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.970
because that's when I learned the truth at a taxi cab.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:17.579
I came to Bethel on February 16, 1979.

00:32:17.579 --> 00:32:21.579
When I first came to Bethel, I had to put music aside for a little bit.

00:32:21.579 --> 00:32:26.579
I started working in the press room, and that was a completely different environment for me.

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:28.579
I also worked with landscaping.

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:33.579
I worked in construction over at Walkill, and I also worked with drafting and engineering.

00:32:33.579 --> 00:32:39.579
These were things I was not good at, but I really felt I learned so much from doing these things,

00:32:39.579 --> 00:32:41.579
that it really kind of groomed me.

00:32:41.579 --> 00:32:46.579
And I think when Jehovah looked at me, as well, we got somebody, we have to work with here.

00:32:46.579 --> 00:32:53.859
Just as you tune your instrument so it can be played and tuned, Jehovah tunes you.

00:32:53.859 --> 00:32:59.859
He teaches us to keep things in their place, and put worship of him first, because that's where it's proper.

00:32:59.859 --> 00:33:03.859
When Jehovah became number one, everything else took its place.

00:33:03.859 --> 00:33:08.859
Back in 1981, I met my wife when I was playing music at a wedding.

00:33:08.859 --> 00:33:10.859
We fell in love with each other.

00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:16.940
As our love for Jehovah goes through the years, our love for our mates grows.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.940
Now, I didn't leave music completely, because I still had a love for it.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:27.940
I still practiced as much as I could within my Bethel schedule, and within my whole theocratic schedule.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.940
I don't miss it being number one.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.940
I just feel happier now, that it's in its proper place.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:38.940
In 1995, when I first came over to Patterson, I was working with Audio Video.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:44.940
Since 2016, I've been working with music, and working as a music editor and as a music composer.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.940
Working with brothers on a piece of music, it's a real blessing and a privilege.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.940
Jehovah is letting us take advantage of a tool that we all like to listen to,

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.940
but now using it in a way that praises him.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.940
Our whole motive is not to earn money.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.940
Our whole motive in using music is to glorify our Heavenly Father Jehovah.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:10.940
And we get music from all different cultures, and it really unites Jehovah's people.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:17.699
Music has a very special power in being able to reach the heart.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:21.699
Now, there's time where we just sit around and we just jam and play,

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.699
and you're really talking and communicating with each other.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:26.699
There's nothing like it.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:32.699
I'm happier now knowing that I've lived a clean life.

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:41.320
Do I have any regrets?

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.630
I have no regrets.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:49.630
What I did when I was 22 years old was the best thing that ever happened to me,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.630
because that's how I came to know Jehovah,

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:54.630
and that's how I was able to find a balance in my life.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:59.230
Our happiness doesn't depend on our job.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:04.230
Our happiness really depends upon our spirituality and our relationship with Jehovah.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:13.530
That's what life is all about.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:19.969
It's a wonderful life.

00:35:19.969 --> 00:35:41.929
Bill has no regrets about the life he's chosen to live by putting his love for Jehovah ahead of his love for music.

00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:47.929
He gained many spiritual privileges and a happy, meaningful life.

00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:54.929
The Apostle Paul wrote that Jehovah loves a cheerful giver.

00:35:54.929 --> 00:36:00.929
That was the subject of a recent morning worship by brother Anthony Morris of the governing body.

00:36:00.929 --> 00:36:05.429
We're going to talk about money.

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:09.429
Now, the fact is we never big for money,

00:36:09.429 --> 00:36:15.429
but that's not to say we can't talk about money in Jehovah's organization, the earthly part.

00:36:16.429 --> 00:36:20.429
As long as standing there is a balance here,

00:36:20.429 --> 00:36:24.429
going back to the watchtower a very long time ago,

00:36:24.429 --> 00:36:33.429
we have never considered it proper to solicit money for the Lord's cause after the common custom referring to Christendom.

00:36:33.429 --> 00:36:41.429
It is our judgment that money raised by the various begging devices in the name of our Lord is offensive,

00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:43.429
unacceptable to him.

00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:50.429
It does not bring his blessing either upon the givers of the work accomplished or the work accomplished.

00:36:50.429 --> 00:36:54.429
So we do not need to be coerced into giving.

00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:59.429
We gladly use our money to support kingdom activities.

00:36:59.429 --> 00:37:02.429
So that stands to this day,

00:37:02.429 --> 00:37:07.429
but we'd never want to come to the conclusion we can't talk about money.

00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:12.429
Money has to be discussed in these last days of this system.

00:37:12.429 --> 00:37:15.429
It meets a response and all things.

00:37:15.429 --> 00:37:18.429
So I thought we'd take some thoughts from the kingdom book.

00:37:18.429 --> 00:37:23.429
Three reasons why we're willing and so willing to give.

00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:25.429
Some beautiful thoughts.

00:37:25.429 --> 00:37:31.429
Well, the first one is connected with doing what's pleasing in Jehovah's eyes.

00:37:31.429 --> 00:37:44.429
And finding the second Corinthians reference here is so crucial to helping people understand that we don't beg for money.

00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:49.429
Nonetheless, we have to talk about it from time to time.

00:37:49.429 --> 00:37:53.429
And here in the ninth chapter,

00:37:53.429 --> 00:37:56.429
donations and such was being discussed.

00:37:56.429 --> 00:38:04.429
And then this profound inspired thought which is reflecting Jehovah's thinking is in verse seven.

00:38:04.429 --> 00:38:06.429
Second Corinthians nine seven.

00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:11.429
Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart,

00:38:11.429 --> 00:38:17.429
not grudgingly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver.

00:38:17.429 --> 00:38:19.429
So there we have it.

00:38:19.429 --> 00:38:28.429
We're happy to give to Jehovah when needs arise and the organization brings it to our attention.

00:38:28.429 --> 00:38:32.429
For example, disasters and such like we had at the annual meeting,

00:38:32.429 --> 00:38:42.429
the report about the increase in disasters and the millions of dollars that of God's kingdom money was used to help our brothers.

00:38:42.429 --> 00:38:50.429
But when it comes to giving, it's an individual responsibility as the verse says resolved in his heart or her heart,

00:38:50.429 --> 00:38:56.429
not grudgingly and the footnote addresses the word reluctantly.

00:38:56.429 --> 00:39:03.429
So it's not like we embarrass people, beg them, look, you're well off, why aren't you giving more?

00:39:03.429 --> 00:39:06.429
Well, that's not their business, that's not our business.

00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:09.429
We have to resolve in our own heart.

00:39:09.429 --> 00:39:21.429
So while we discuss money, we never come across like we're putting people and trying to get them to even grudgingly give just so we get the money.

00:39:21.429 --> 00:39:23.429
That's not this organization.

00:39:23.429 --> 00:39:28.429
Of course, Christendomely are experts at begging for money.

00:39:28.429 --> 00:39:30.429
So we loved Jehovah.

00:39:30.429 --> 00:39:36.429
We want to be the kind of person that he loves and you notice that beautiful expression.

00:39:36.429 --> 00:39:38.429
God loves a cheerful giver.

00:39:38.429 --> 00:39:40.429
One translation put it nicely.

00:39:40.429 --> 00:39:44.429
God loves people who love to give.

00:39:44.429 --> 00:39:46.429
And that's true.

00:39:46.429 --> 00:39:48.429
So we want Jehovah to love us.

00:39:48.429 --> 00:39:58.429
So this money we might have whatever amounts, depending on our own personal circumstances, we're happy to give to kingdom interest.

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:03.429
So that's the first one we make these donations because of our love for Jehovah.

00:40:04.429 --> 00:40:07.429
Now the second one, this is interesting.

00:40:07.429 --> 00:40:15.429
A heart-searching principle found back in the Mosaic law turned to Deuteronomy chapter 16, if you would please.

00:40:15.429 --> 00:40:18.429
And Deuteronomy 16.

00:40:18.429 --> 00:40:24.429
And you'll see the connection while this applied to the Jews at that time.

00:40:24.429 --> 00:40:27.429
You'll see how it applies to us in our day.

00:40:27.429 --> 00:40:32.429
We're going to read verse 16 and then verse 17 of Deuteronomy 16.

00:40:33.429 --> 00:40:46.429
Three times a year, all your males should appear before Jehovah your God in the place that he chooses at the festival of unleavened bread, the festival of weeks, and the festival of booze.

00:40:46.429 --> 00:40:53.429
Now notice, and none of them should appear before Jehovah empty handed.

00:40:53.429 --> 00:41:00.429
The gifts that each one brings should be in proportion to the blessing that Jehovah your God has given you.

00:41:01.429 --> 00:41:04.429
So I'll let that sink in.

00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:11.429
And this is what Jehovah wanted to be conveyed to the Israelites, to attend these festivals, not.

00:41:11.429 --> 00:41:27.429
He didn't say if you're well off, you've had a great year, as opposed to some that were poor, you still had issues back at that time, even though it was Jehovah's nation, but he said none should appear empty handed.

00:41:28.429 --> 00:41:40.429
So that takes in all of us, whatever our circumstances are, whether it's Bethel or in the field, Jehovah doesn't approve coming empty handed.

00:41:40.429 --> 00:41:48.429
And what would help us to not come empty handed in this case back in Israel or in our time either?

00:41:48.429 --> 00:41:52.429
Notice verse 17, and this is a lot to think about.

00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:59.429
The gift that each one brings should be in proportion to the blessing that Jehovah your God has given you.

00:41:59.429 --> 00:42:01.429
So there we have it.

00:42:01.429 --> 00:42:11.429
You stop and reflect that they were supposed to do that, and we can do the same throughout the year, reflect on the blessings that Jehovah God has given us.

00:42:11.429 --> 00:42:15.429
You have to take time to do that. You have to give that consideration.

00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:18.429
The gift that each one brings should be in proportion to the blessing.

00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:25.429
So adding up these blessings, then we're happy to give out of our material possessions.

00:42:25.429 --> 00:42:37.429
So profound thought there and something to reflect on so that we don't find ourselves when it comes to contributions on a monthly basis or whatever, empty handed.

00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:49.429
While I'm doing so much here and there, money meets a response in all things, and you have to take that into account, even if we're in the poor range.

00:42:49.429 --> 00:42:54.429
Now, the third one is connected with our love for Jesus.

00:42:54.429 --> 00:42:58.429
Let's turn to John chapter 14, if you would please.

00:42:58.429 --> 00:43:08.429
John chapter 14, we give and have voluntary contributions because we love our Lord Jesus.

00:43:08.429 --> 00:43:11.429
And notice what he stated here.

00:43:11.429 --> 00:43:16.429
John chapter 14 and verse 23.

00:43:16.429 --> 00:43:19.429
In answer, Jesus said to him,

00:43:19.429 --> 00:43:23.429
If anyone loves me, he will observe my word.

00:43:23.429 --> 00:43:29.429
And my father will love him and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.

00:43:29.429 --> 00:43:36.429
So I appreciate how Jesus put it if so it's a responsibility that falls on us individually.

00:43:36.429 --> 00:43:47.429
But if we say we love Jesus and when I'm like Christendom with this proclamation of their love for Jesus, they really don't even know the real Jesus, frankly.

00:43:47.429 --> 00:43:50.429
So you get an accurate knowledge of the truth.

00:43:50.429 --> 00:43:57.429
But if we're in the truth or dedicated baptized servants of him, if we really love him, we're going to observe his word.

00:43:57.429 --> 00:44:05.429
Now, that means not just carrying out the kingdom, putting our time and energy into it, it also means money.

00:44:05.429 --> 00:44:10.429
We are willing to donate money to support the worldwide work.

00:44:10.429 --> 00:44:25.429
We're not ashamed to admit that this takes money to have these things operate, branches and supporting all of the preaching work, the kingdom work, all these other initiatives that we've had in recent years, it takes money.

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:39.429
You can't go to people that you buy things from and say, well, look, this is a nonprofit organization trying to shame them and can you give it to no, they want their money to be paid for the various things that we have to use.

00:44:39.429 --> 00:44:42.429
To accomplish your hova's work.

00:44:42.429 --> 00:44:47.429
So something to keep mine, those three things there, our love for Jehovah.

00:44:47.429 --> 00:44:49.429
We want to do its pleasing to him.

00:44:49.429 --> 00:44:52.429
We count our blessings from Jehovah.

00:44:52.429 --> 00:44:58.429
Then we have our love for Christ Jesus, and we want to do whatever we can.

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:04.429
So how you do it with the financial contributions, that's a personal decision.

00:45:04.429 --> 00:45:07.429
And Jehovah dignifies us with that.

00:45:07.429 --> 00:45:14.429
We never want to be shaming somebody that we think they should be doing this, and so that's a personal matter.

00:45:14.429 --> 00:45:20.429
But keep in mind, sometimes if you are poor, remember the widow.

00:45:20.429 --> 00:45:26.429
So she didn't come there to the temple empty handed.

00:45:26.429 --> 00:45:32.429
She didn't have much, but Jehovah loved her. Jesus loved her forgiving what she had.

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:37.429
So even when we're poor, we're expected to give, monetarily.

00:45:37.429 --> 00:45:46.429
And it's because we love Jehovah, love Jesus, and we appreciate all the blessings we've received during the year and our grateful.

00:45:46.429 --> 00:45:56.969
As we've discussed, we fight discouragement by replacing negative thoughts with positive thoughts.

00:45:56.969 --> 00:45:59.969
Let's do that right now.

00:45:59.969 --> 00:46:06.969
Please enjoy our new music video. It's entitled Always Rejoice.

00:46:06.969 --> 00:50:23.059
Didn't that bring a smile to your face?

00:50:23.059 --> 00:50:31.059
Our program reminded us that we can successfully fight discouragement and remain joyful.

00:50:31.059 --> 00:50:39.059
Despite many hardships, our sister I know remained faithful and happy by staying close to fellow believers

00:50:39.059 --> 00:50:43.059
and keeping herself spiritually nourished.

00:50:43.059 --> 00:50:51.059
We learned how to build strong friendships, which are blessing in times of need and discouragement.

00:50:51.059 --> 00:51:01.059
Bill put his love for God ahead of his love for music and has enjoyed a meaningful life serving Jehovah.

00:51:01.059 --> 00:51:09.059
And this month's music video is a happy song that we'll want to sing again and again.

00:51:09.059 --> 00:51:13.059
Now let's visit our brothers and sisters in Quebec, Canada.

00:51:13.059 --> 00:51:20.440
Quebec is the largest Canadian province by land area.

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:24.440
This is home to more than 24,000 brothers and sisters.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:35.440
The province is known for its natural beauty, the St. Lawrence River, thousands of lakes, waterfalls, ski slopes and forests.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:44.440
Quebec is rich with wildlife, moose, caribou, beavers, wolves, and the snowy owl.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:49.440
Jehovah's people began preaching here in the 1920s.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:54.440
Government opposition, stirred up by the clergy, began almost immediately.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:52:04.440
In 1946, our brothers held a 16-day campaign to publicize the state's disregard for freedom of worship.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.440
That led to the arrest of hundreds of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:18.440
The first to be tried were brother Emmy Boucher and his two daughters, one of whom was just 11 years of age.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:29.440
In 1950, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in their favor, legally establishing the right of Jehovah's Witnesses to preach in Quebec.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.440
Today our brothers are taking full advantage of this freedom.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.440
Montreal is the province's largest city.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:48.440
Publishers enjoy public witnessing in Montreal's popular tourist areas, subway system and ports, where workers come from many countries.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:55.440
They preach to students attending the city's eight universities and many colleges.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:03.440
In Quebec City, they even preach in front of the government buildings, where decades ago laws were written to stop our work.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:08.440
Brother Boucher was from the small town of La Ketchume.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:12.440
There are 71 publishers in the congregation here.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:22.440
Their vast territory includes a lot of farmland, but their hard work to reach everyone has produced several Bible studies.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:33.440
The average mid-winter temperature here is about negative 12 degrees Celsius, or about 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and it often gets much colder.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:38.440
Despite the temperature, our brothers enjoy warm association.

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:44.440
Quebec produces more than 70% of the world's maple syrup.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:57.440
A favorite candy is maple taffy, made by boiling the sap from maple trees, pouring it onto snow, letting it harden, and then rolling it onto a stick.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:06.440
Our brothers and sisters in the La Ketchume congregation sends us their love and greetings.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:12.440
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
