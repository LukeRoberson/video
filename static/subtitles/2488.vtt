Nice comments today! Both of you. So mom, will we? Go to the park? Hmm, I think so.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:34.299
Oh, okay. We just have to wait a bit for Dad. Then see what he says. Here comes Dad. Oh, it looks like somebody needs a ride.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:46.320
Thank you so much. I hope this doesn't spoil your plans. What a beautiful afternoon.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:01:02.060
All right. We're going to take Wilfrid home and help him with a few things, okay? I'll get the tools.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:19.780
Caleb, you know, today you can make something Jesus made all the time. Make something? What? A sacrifice?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:50.609
How? Well, Jesus worked hard and sometimes he had plans to rest. But when people needed his help, he made a sacrifice, giving up what he wanted to do to help someone else.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:02:21.560
With rides. And how did that make him feel? Happy. Even if he didn't get to go to the park.
