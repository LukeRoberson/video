00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:20.199
Greetings! My name is Joshua, of the tribe of Ephraim, of the family of Joseph.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:32.200
I was Moses attendant. After Moses' death, I was appointed by Jehovah to lead the nation of Israel across the Jordan into the promised land.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200
Jehovah said to me,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:47.200
Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will neither desert you nor abandon you. Be courageous and strong.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.200
For you are the one who will cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their forefathers I would give to them.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:06.739
I took those words seriously. There was no doubt in my mind that Jehovah would fulfill what he had spoken regarding his people.

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:17.739
Every word of his to my forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph had come true. There is no need to doubt Jehovah in any matter.

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:25.739
We may not know exactly how things will work out, but Jehovah's word will surely take place.

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:33.739
I stand before you today to strengthen your faith and your confidence in Jehovah, our God.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:39.739
So let us now go back in time some 3,500 years.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:46.739
As our story develops, you will see how not one word of Jehovah has failed.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:02:03.659
Moses, my servant, is dead. Now get up, cross the Jordan. You and all this people, and go into the land that I am giving to them.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.449
Joshua, you seem to be deep in thought. What are you thinking about, the land of promise?

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:17.449
No. I'm thinking about the heart of our people.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.449
What do you mean?

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:28.449
For forty years, Caleb, for forty years we have wandered through this wilderness. And for what reason?

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.449
The people's lack of faith. I will remember how.

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:39.449
Right after we left Egypt, Moses sent you and me and ten others to spy out the promise land.

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:44.449
You and I brought back a favorable report. The others stirred up fear.

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:49.449
The ten spies, Caleb, reflected the collective heart of the people.

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:53.449
How quickly they turned against us.

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:57.449
I remember. They even threatened to stone us.

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:08.449
Yes, they were overcome with fear. And they thought that the anachim, the so-called giants, were the Nephilim, the offspring of demons.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:13.449
I can still remember their faithless complaints.

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:20.449
Moses, these are not ordinary men. They will crush us as if we were grasshoppers.

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.449
It would be folly to confront them.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.449
Moses, think. How can we possibly conquer such people?

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:33.449
Their cities are fortified. We will never breach their walls.

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.449
Think of what they will do to our wives and children.

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:44.819
How quickly they forgot Jehovah's mighty acts in Egypt.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.819
Yes, but those faithless ones are gone. This new generation is different.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.819
They're full of zeal, ready to obey, eager to get into the promised land.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.819
Now we stand before another body of water. The Jordan River ready to cross.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.819
Will this new generation have the courage and the faith to enter the land of their inheritance?

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.819
Jehovah spoke to me only this morning.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.819
What did he say?

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.819
Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:23.819
I will neither desert you nor abandon you.

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.819
Be courageous and strong.

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:32.290
Caleb, there is no doubt in my heart.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.290
Jehovah will not leave us.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.290
But we must put our full trust in him.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.290
We must show unwavering obedience.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.290
Our enemy is strong, but Jehovah is stronger.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.290
With Jehovah's help, we will succeed.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.290
I have been waiting 40 years for this.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.290
Pass throughout the camp, Caleb.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.290
Command the officers and the people.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:07.290
Get provisions ready because we are about to cross the Jordan to take possession of the land that Jehovah is giving us.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.290
It shall be done.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.290
Where are my two spies?

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.290
Here we are, Joshua.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.290
Go.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.290
Take a look at the land and at Jericho.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.290
Report back to me what you have found.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:48.379
We will return to you shortly.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.379
You men have been sent by God.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.379
Of which God do you speak?

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.379
Why, Jehovah. The God of the Israelites.

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.379
He must have brought you to my house.

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.379
What do you know of this God?

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.379
I have heard what Jehovah did to the Egyptian army and to Pharaoh.

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.379
I do know that Jehovah will give you the land.

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:11.379
Us?

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:14.379
Yes. I know that you were Israelites.

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.379
Do not be concerned.

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.379
The fear of you has fallen upon everyone in the city.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:26.379
For we have all heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you left Egypt.

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:28.379
Speak more softly.

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:33.379
When we heard that you defeated Sihon and Og, we lost heart.

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.379
No one has the courage to stand up to you.

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:42.379
For Jehovah your God is stronger than our gods and he fights for you.

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.379
Open up.

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:46.379
Open this door.

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:48.379
Who is it?

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:52.379
Open this door now in the name of the King of Jericho.

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:53.379
I'm coming.

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.379
Quick. This way.

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.379
Up the steps to the roof.

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:59.379
Open yourself with the stalks of flags.

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.379
Open up.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.379
Just a moment.

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:05.379
Bring out the men who came to you.

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.379
What men?

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:10.379
Men come and go from here at all hours of the day and night.

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.379
The strangers who have come into your house.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:16.379
They are spies from the camp of Israel.

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.379
They have come to spy out the city and all the land.

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:21.379
Where are they?

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:24.379
I did not know who you mean.

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:26.379
Oh.

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.379
Now I remember.

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:30.379
There were two men who came to me.

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:33.379
But I did not know where they were from.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:34.379
Excuse me.

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:36.379
I had to consider who you meant by.

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:38.379
You knew exactly who we were talking about.

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:39.379
Where are they?

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:40.379
Bring them out to us.

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:42.379
There's no one else here.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.379
As you can see.

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:45.379
Check the roof.

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:48.379
Sir, there were two men.

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:50.379
That much I know.

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:53.379
But when the city gate was about to be closed,

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:56.379
the men left and went out into the dark.

00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:58.379
I just don't know where they have gone.

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:01.379
There's nothing up there, but some flax drying.

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:04.379
If you quickly chase after them, you will catch up with them.

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:06.379
Come on then.

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:09.379
You had better not be lying.

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:12.379
If we don't find them, we'll be back.

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:13.379
Come on.

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:14.379
Stop talking.

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:16.379
We have to get going.

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:21.920
They're gone.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.920
Come down quickly.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.990
Thank you.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.990
We owe you our lives.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.990
You owe your lives to your God.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.990
He rescued you from their hands.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.990
Do you really believe this?

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.990
Yes.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.990
With all my heart.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.990
Only from what you have heard?

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.990
Yes.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:47.990
I believe that every word that Jehovah speaks will never fail.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.990
And now, please swear to me by Jehovah,

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.990
that because I showed loyal love to you,

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.990
you will also show loyal love to my father's household.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.990
And you must give me a sign of good faith.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.990
You must spare the lives of my father and mother,

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.990
my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.990
And you must save us from death.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.990
What is your name?

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.990
I am called Rahab.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.990
Rahab, if you do not tell about our mission,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.990
then we will show loyal love and faithfulness toward you

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.990
when Jehovah gives us the land.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.990
Here is a rope.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.990
They must have closed the city gate by now.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.990
Descend from this window.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.990
There are no guards on the side of the wall.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.990
No one will see you in the dark.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.990
Thank you.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.990
Go to the mountains and hide there for three days,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.990
so that those pursuing you may not find you.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.990
Then you may return to your people.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.990
And you?

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.990
Do not worry about me.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.990
We will be free from guilt respecting this oath of yours.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.990
Look, when we come into the land,

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.990
this cord of scarlet thread,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.990
you should hang outside the window.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.990
And all your father's household,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.990
you should gather into the house and stay inside.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.990
Let it be according to your words.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.990
May your God, Jehovah, be with you.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.990
And with me and my family.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:35.320
Jericho fell,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.320
and Rahab and her family were spared.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.320
Jehovah had decreed that everything in the city be destroyed,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.320
though all the silver and gold were to be delivered to his treasury.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:11:17.820
No one was to take anything for himself.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.820
Aiken, what is it?

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.820
Why are you looking so smug?

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.820
We are rich, dear one.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.820
Rich?

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.820
What are you talking about?

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.820
See for yourselves.

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:36.019
Give that to me.

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:37.019
That's mine.

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:40.019
You have done well, my husband.

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:44.019
I took it from the rich, selfish, ungodly canonites.

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:46.019
Did anyone see you?

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:47.019
No.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:48.019
I was careful.

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:49.019
Are you sure?

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:50.019
Yes.

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:53.019
No one could possibly know.

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:57.019
Father, this will give us a good start in the promised land.

00:11:57.019 --> 00:12:00.019
But we must hide all of these treasures.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:04.019
Yes, keep them hidden.

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:08.019
What no one sees, no one knows.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.019
Agreed?

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:12.019
Come then.

00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:29.899
Let us hide all of it.

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:34.899
When we attacked the city of AI, we suffered defeat.

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:39.899
Jehovah then revealed that someone had taken something that was to be destroyed

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:44.899
and had stolen gold and silver meant for Jehovah's treasury.

00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:48.899
The next morning, Jehovah had all Israel come near,

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:55.899
tribe by tribe, family by family, household by household, man by man.

00:12:55.899 --> 00:13:04.750
Finally, Jehovah revealed the disobedient man, my son.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:11.750
My Lord, please honor Jehovah the God of Israel and make confession to him.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.750
Tell me, please, what you have done.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.750
Do not hide it from me.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:27.159
For a fact, I am the one who sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel.

00:13:27.159 --> 00:13:33.159
When I saw among the spoil of Jehovah an official garment from Shiner,

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:36.159
such a good-looking one.

00:13:36.159 --> 00:13:38.159
And?

00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:40.159
Yes.

00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:43.159
And 200 checkles of silver.

00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:45.159
Go on.

00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:47.159
Yes.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:50.159
And one gold bar weighing 50 checkles.

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:55.159
Aiken, why did you take them?

00:13:55.159 --> 00:13:58.159
I desired them.

00:13:58.159 --> 00:14:00.159
So I took them.

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:02.159
But why?

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:04.159
Look at me.

00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:08.159
Did you not hear the same words we all heard?

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:10.159
The instructions were clear.

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:13.159
The city was to be devoted to destruction.

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:19.159
Were you not aware that it and everything in it belonged to Jehovah?

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:21.159
Yes.

00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:22.159
I was.

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:27.159
And yet you stole these things?

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:29.159
Yes.

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:30.159
Why?

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:34.159
What does this garment from Shiner mean to you?

00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:36.159
It was...

00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:39.159
You have to see it, Jehovah.

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:41.159
It is beautiful.

00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:43.159
It is one whole piece.

00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:45.159
The finest material.

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:47.159
Fit for a king.

00:14:47.159 --> 00:14:50.159
I have never seen such brilliant colors.

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:52.159
Enough, my son.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:53.159
Enough.

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:54.159
Tell me.

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:56.159
Where is it?

00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:59.159
It is hidden in the ground.

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:02.159
Inside my tent.

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:04.159
With the money underneath it.

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:06.159
Go, Ishbak.

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:09.159
See if these words are true.

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:13.159
Netavaya, go and find his family.

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:19.159
Aiken, did you not know that Jehovah would see you?

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:21.159
I didn't think of that.

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:24.159
You had no need of these things.

00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:29.159
You have a bull and a donkey and a flock.

00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:31.440
I...

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.440
I don't know what to say.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.440
For a fact,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.440
I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:57.519
Why have you brought disaster upon us?

00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:02.519
Jehovah will bring disaster upon you on this day.

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:05.519
Netavaya, take them away.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:15.039
Jehovah warned that willful disobedience brings bad consequences.

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:19.039
Aiken's case shows that in this way too,

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:22.039
Jehovah's word never fails.

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:25.039
But what of the Canaanites?

00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:28.039
Jehovah gave his word that they would be destroyed.

00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:31.039
This also came true.

00:16:31.039 --> 00:16:36.039
But we could not always foresee how things would work out.

00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:48.659
Who are you?

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:51.659
You are not of our people.

00:16:51.659 --> 00:16:54.659
Where do you men come from?

00:16:54.659 --> 00:16:57.659
We have come from a very distant land.

00:16:57.659 --> 00:17:02.659
Now please, my Lord, make a covenant of peace with us.

00:17:02.659 --> 00:17:06.660
Please, my Lord, we are your servants.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.660
How could we make a covenant with you?

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.660
That may not be possible.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.660
We must be careful to obey the direction from Jehovah.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.660
Perhaps you are dwelling nearby.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.660
No, my Lord.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.660
We have come from far away from a very distant land.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.660
We have heard of the fame of Jehovah your God

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.660
and of all that he did in Egypt

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.660
and how he defeated two kings of the Amorites

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.660
who were on the other side of the Jordan,

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.660
just as he said he would do.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.660
So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.660
told us,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.660
take provisions with you for the journey

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.660
and go to meet them.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.660
Tell them,

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.660
we will be your servants.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.660
Now make a covenant with us.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.660
See this bread of ours.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.660
It was still hot on the day we left our houses

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.660
to come here to you.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.660
And now, look.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.660
It is dry and crumbly.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.660
And these wine skins were new when we filled them.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.660
But now they have burst.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.660
And our garments and sandals have worn out

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.660
because of the great length of the journey.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.660
I must discuss this matter with the older men.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.170
What do you think?

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.170
They seem to be sincere.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.829
And they have evidence to back up their story.

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:43.829
Let it be just as you have spoken.

00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:48.829
We make a covenant of peace with you and your people.

00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:50.829
Please.

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.829
Swear to us.

00:18:52.829 --> 00:18:54.829
We do swear to you.

00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:56.829
I do swear also.

00:18:56.829 --> 00:18:59.829
And so do all of us.

00:18:59.829 --> 00:19:15.339
Joshua,

00:19:15.339 --> 00:19:18.339
the men with whom we made a covenant just three days ago.

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:20.339
They lied to us.

00:19:20.339 --> 00:19:22.339
They are not from far away.

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:24.339
They are from Givin.

00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:26.339
Only a day's march from here.

00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:28.339
Are the men still in the camp?

00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:29.339
They are.

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:37.220
Bring them to me.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.220
Why did you trick us by saying

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.220
we are from a place very far away from you

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.220
when you really live right among us?

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.220
From now on you are cursed.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.220
And you will always occupy a slave's position

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.220
as gatherers of wood and drawers of water

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.220
for the house of my God.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.220
It was because your servants were plainly told

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.220
that Jehovah your God had commanded Moses, his servant,

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.220
to give you all the land

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.220
and to annihilate all its inhabitants.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.220
So we were afraid for our lives.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.220
We know that whatever Jehovah declares

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.220
will surely come true.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.220
And now we are at your mercy.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.220
Due to us, whatever you think is good and right.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.220
So may our word prove to be.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.220
We have sworn to a covenant of peace with you.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:39.410
You will come to know harm.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.410
The other Canaanites were already preparing to fight us.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.410
Just imagine what took place

00:20:46.410 --> 00:21:02.559
when they heard what the Ghibinites had done.

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:06.559
Counselors, what are we to do?

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:08.559
You know the situation.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:11.559
The whole city of Jebus is in turmoil.

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:14.559
The people are paralyzed with fear.

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:16.559
It is true, my Lord, the King.

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:19.559
I haven't slept for three nights.

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:22.559
May bale grant you peace, O King.

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:25.559
Peace. Israel has crossed the Jordan

00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:28.559
and defeated Jericho and AI.

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:31.559
Soon they will be at our gates.

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:34.559
The people are saying that their God, Jehovah,

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.559
parted the river at flood stage

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:40.559
and that he made Jericho's walls fall flat.

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:43.559
I find that hard to believe, O King.

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:46.559
The fact is, General Zahem,

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:49.559
that Jericho and AI are no more.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:51.559
Do you believe that?

00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:54.559
There is something else you need to know, my Lord.

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:57.559
What is it? Speak in, Lil.

00:21:57.559 --> 00:22:00.559
The Ghibinites have defected.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:02.559
They have made peace with Israel.

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:05.559
What? How do you know that?

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:07.559
The report has just come in.

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:09.559
We have confirmed that it is true.

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:11.559
No!

00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:13.559
Ghibin is a great city,

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:16.559
even stronger than AI.

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:18.559
All its men are warriors.

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:20.559
Why would they do such a thing?

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.559
They believe that Jerichova

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:25.559
will help Israel conquer all of our cities.

00:22:25.559 --> 00:22:27.559
Ridiculous!

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:29.559
Bale is stronger than Jerichova.

00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:31.559
Has not Bale blessed us

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:34.559
for all the sacrifices we have offered him?

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:36.559
He will protect us.

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:39.559
Why didn't Bale protect Jericho and AI?

00:22:39.559 --> 00:22:42.559
Priest, didn't they have enough sacred orgies?

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:45.559
Sacrifice enough of their children?

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:47.559
O King,

00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:49.559
these Israelites want to destroy our culture,

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:51.559
our traditions,

00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:53.559
our very identity.

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:55.559
Worship aside, O King.

00:22:55.559 --> 00:22:57.559
We need to be practical.

00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:59.559
We cannot leave Ghibin unpunished.

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:01.559
If we do,

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:03.559
other cities may side with Israel.

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:06.559
So, what do you advise?

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.559
I recommend that we gather together

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:10.559
with the other kings of Canaan

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:12.559
and march against Ghibin immediately.

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:15.559
Bale will march with you.

00:23:15.559 --> 00:23:17.559
My Lord, may I say something?

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.559
Speak, Enlil.

00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:21.559
Perhaps Ghibin's decision

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:25.559
was not entirely unwise.

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:27.559
Explain yourself.

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:31.559
We're not confronting merely an army of men, my Lord.

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:33.559
We face a powerful God

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:35.559
who fights for those people.

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:38.559
Ghibin understands that.

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:40.559
So, what do you suggest

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:43.559
that we capitulate to Israel?

00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:45.559
Perhaps that's the course of wisdom.

00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:47.559
Wisdom?

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:50.559
What kind of man are you?

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:53.559
Did you not hear how Jehovah freed Israel from Egypt?

00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:57.559
And what he did to Pharaoh's army at the Red Sea?

00:23:57.559 --> 00:24:00.559
The Egyptian army was far stronger than ours.

00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:03.559
But it was wiped out in a single day.

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:06.559
Are you letting those rumors frighten you old man?

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:09.559
There is little truth in them.

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:13.559
My Lord, the King, they are not merely rumors.

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:16.559
I have spoken with men from Egypt

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:20.559
who saw these things happen with their own eyes.

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:24.559
Ah, that legend is more than 40 years old.

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:27.559
We must be realistic, O King.

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:29.559
We need not cower before the enemy.

00:24:29.559 --> 00:24:33.559
Israel is weak and unskilled in warfare.

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:36.559
We need to act and act now.

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:41.059
You speak well, Zaham.

00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:45.059
Send for the other kings and their armies.

00:24:45.059 --> 00:24:48.059
First, we shall punish Ghibin.

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:54.059
Then, by the might of Bale, we shall annihilate Israel.

00:24:54.059 --> 00:25:00.059
No more will the name of Jehovah be mentioned in this land.

00:25:00.059 --> 00:25:11.750
And the five kings of the Amorites came

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.750
and camped against Ghibin to war against it.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.750
At that, the men of Ghibin sent to me saying,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.750
come quickly and rescue us.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.750
So we went up and Jehovah said to me,

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.750
Do not be afraid of them.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.750
For I have handed them over to you.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.750
Not one of them will be able to stand against you.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.750
Once again, Jehovah's word came true.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.750
As the kings and their armies ran away from before us,

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.750
Jehovah hurled great hailstones on them

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:52.750
so that more died from the hailed than from the swords of our fighting men.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.750
But the sun was starting to set.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:00.750
It was then that I called out to Jehovah before the eyes of Israel saying,

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:07.750
son, stand still over Ghibin and moon over the valley of Igelon.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.750
So the sun stood still and the moon did not move

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.750
until the nation could take vengeance on its enemies.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:28.960
I enjoyed a long and eventful life and I saw many miracles.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.960
I saw Jehovah's ten plagues on the Egyptians,

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.960
how he brought us through the Red Sea

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.960
while he destroyed the Egyptian army,

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.960
how he provided food and water for us in the wilderness,

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.960
how he fought for us time after time and protected us from our many enemies

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.960
and brought us safely into the promised land.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.960
And I have learned many things.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.960
I have learned to accept Jehovah's discipline

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.960
and to trust in his word with all my heart.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:08.960
In the case of Rahab, I saw how faith and firm conviction can transform us

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.960
as we keep making the truth our own.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:19.960
In Akin's case, I saw how vital it is to root out selfishness from our heart

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.960
and to obey Jehovah's words fully.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.960
And the most important thing I have learned?

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.960
I can testify with all my heart and with all my soul

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:38.960
that not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah has spoken,

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.960
not one word has failed and not one word ever will.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.960
They will all come true.
