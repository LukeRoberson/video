00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.750
In the previous episode, we explored the early history of our song books, but it ended with a twist.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.750
For the most part, we stopped singing at congregation meetings in the late 30s.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.750
For how long?

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.750
Publications in the archive revealed that it was from 1938 to 1944.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:46.750
And though brothers and sisters did sing at conventions, they really missed singing together at congregation meetings.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.939
When did we start again?

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:57.939
It was a time of rapid progress.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:01.939
New methods were tried, meeting formats changed.

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:05.939
Welcome to 1944.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.939
You're at the United Announcers' Theocratic Assembly in Buffalo, New York, USA.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.939
The clock above the arena floor reads 430 in the afternoon.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.939
Brother F.W. Franz steps up to give a talk called Song of Kingdom Service.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:34.939
He says it is proper and pleasing to God for his earthly servants to lift their voices in literal song.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.939
As he's speaking, Brother Nathan Nor steps forward and hands him a red booklet.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.939
Then, Brother Franz announces the release of the Kingdom Service Song Book.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.939
He explains that this book will be used for singing at congregation meetings.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.939
The crowd is overjoyed.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.939
Singing was once again a part of our meetings.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:15.639
Since then, we've received several new songbooks, each one a gift from Jehovah.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:38.620
Songs from the 1950 and 1966 songbooks used terms from the more recently released New World translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.620
The topics and lyrics were more up to date and any songs with false religious teachings were removed.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.620
From the Kingdom Service Song Book forward, the names of the composers and lyricists were not published.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.620
All credit was given to Jehovah.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.620
By 1984, musical arrangements were simplified.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.620
They even added chords, so it was easier to play the songs on guitar and piano.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:19.620
We produced records, cassettes, CDs and digital files so that you could sing along at the Kingdom Hall, at home or in the car.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.620
Jehovah's people had so much music to enjoy in printed or recorded form.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.409
But that wasn't always the case everywhere.

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:40.409
Which takes us back to where we started in Part 1, that secret recording from Siberia.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:48.409
During World War II, our brothers in the former Soviet Union faced extreme opposition.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.409
Imagine yourself there.

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.409
You have almost no printed literature.

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.409
Much of it is just copied by hand.

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:04.409
You could be subjected to forced labor and exile if caught with a copy of the watchtower.

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:10.409
The only songbook available to them in Russian was the 1928 songbook.

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:22.410
This means they didn't receive the 1984, the 1966 songbook, the 1950 songbook or the 1944 songbook.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.410
What would you do?

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.410
Would you stop singing? Did they?

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.410
They sang what they already had in their minds and hearts.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.410
They made copies of the 1928 songbook, like this one.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.410
Our brothers and sisters kept singing even in the darkest of times.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:58.420
And they did this for decades until they finally were able to lift their voices publicly in song once again.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:07.420
And that's exactly what happened at the first international convention in the former Soviet Union in 1992.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.420
At last, thousands of our brothers could sing together.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.420
But what would they sing since they didn't have a current songbook?

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:33.709
Special brochures with lyrics were made so that everyone could sing along.

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:39.709
So why is singing so important to Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:44.709
Because singing to Jehovah keeps us close to him.

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:49.709
Singing Bible truths embeds them in our heart.

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:55.709
And singing praises shows our appreciation to the creator of music.

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:59.709
Jehovah for the gift of song.
