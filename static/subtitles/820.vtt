00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.669
What will you do in the face of Satan's attack?

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:12.210
Well, that's a relevant question for all of us here because without exception, we're

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.269
under a vicious, intense attack.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:23.929
But the question is, as the battle intensifies in our individual cases, will we be able to

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.289
stand our ground, bravely fight, and come off victorious?

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.369
Well, obviously, your desire is to be victorious, isn't it?

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:36.890
You wouldn't be attending this special program.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.929
But we need more than just the desire if we're going to ensure victory.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:51.810
In fact, to win any battle, we need accurate knowledge of three things.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.969
We need to know our enemy, know his strategy, and know what we have to defend ourselves.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.890
Now first, let's talk about our enemy, Satan.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.730
He is no ordinary foe.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.010
Jehovah educates us regarding this enemy we're fighting.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.969
For one thing, he's a premeditated murderer.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:20.769
Look at what he did to Job's attendance, slaughtered them with marauder bands.

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:23.290
Others were consumed with fire.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.769
Look at what he did to Job's ten children.

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:32.450
He murdered simultaneously, all ten of them, with a violent windstorm.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.010
Yes, he's a premeditated murderer.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.370
He wants to murder into everlasting death, every one of us here.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.810
Now on top of this, he is highly intelligent.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.849
As one brother said, he may be evil wicked, murderous, but he's not stupid.

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.450
He's highly intelligent.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.209
In fact, think about this.

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:00.769
The fact that he was once in the truth makes him more intelligent in a sense, or we could

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:05.170
say clever, because he has knowledge of having been in the truth.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.449
John 844, he did not stand fast in the truth, but he was in the truth.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.449
Not to illustrate how this makes him more dangerous.

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:22.409
Think about a few of the false brothers during World War II who left the truth and joined

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.210
the Nazis in persecuting the brothers in the truth.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.009
They had knowledge of who were taking the lead.

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.009
They knew where they lived.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.169
They knew the strategy that was being utilized.

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.169
They were more dangerous, weren't they?

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.129
Well, the same with Satan.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:47.210
Second Corinthians 1114 says Satan keeps disguising himself as an angel of light.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.009
Now it's very easy for him to pretend to be what he used to be.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.250
That makes him more dangerous.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.610
Now, open up, please, to Revelation 12, very familiar Scripture.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:08.610
But let's reason on this to help us further, not underestimate, underrate our enemy.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:17.129
Revelation 12 verse 7, and war broke out in heaven, Michael and his angels battled with

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.409
the dragon and the dragon and its angels battled, but they did not prevail nor was a place

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.330
found for them any longer in heaven.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.889
So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called devil and Satan, who

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.530
is misleading the entire inhabited earth.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.050
He was hurled down to the earth and his angels were hurled down with him.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.009
And then look at verse 12.

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:51.770
From this account be glad you heavens and you who reside in them.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:59.370
Whoa, for the earth and for the sea, because the devil has come down to you having great

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.770
anger knowing that he has a short period of time.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:10.050
Now, you notice he's not just mad, he has great anger.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.090
Why is he so angry?

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:18.449
Well, for one thing, after he lost the war in heaven, he wasn't merely asked to leave

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.810
heaven and he quietly left.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.850
We read he was hurled out of heaven and that denotes throne with great force, so that

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.089
undoubtedly added to his great anger.

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:39.129
But also think about this, the tremendous reduction of his fear of movement adds undoubtedly

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.970
to his great anger.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:47.250
Before being cast out of heaven, apparently he had access to the vast, vast physical spiritual

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.569
heavens.

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:56.050
But now confined to the vicinity of this little tiny earth.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.089
And if you think about it, not only does that make you mad, it makes you more dangerous,

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:01.089
doesn't?

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:07.050
Before being cast out of heaven, undoubtedly, he would try to turn away the angels part

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.209
of the time.

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.410
He would try to turn away human sea.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.449
He was divided in his attention.

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.129
But now we have his undivided attention, don't we?

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.930
So that's bad for us and that makes him dangerous.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.370
Here's another illustration about the increasing of the danger.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:33.089
I'd like you to imagine that all of the Mafia members, all of the drug cartel members,

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:38.730
and all of the terrorists of the entire planet Earth were gathered up and were confined to

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.810
New York City.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.329
The city limits and you live there too.

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:48.930
Now can you imagine the escalation of crime and evil that would take place there?

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:56.009
Additionally, we read, he's mad and angry because he knows his time is short.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:02.970
Now if that's true, back around 1914, what about today over a hundred years later?

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.490
He knows his expiration date is almost here.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.209
So he added all up.

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:14.170
His anger is truly really white hot, you could say.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.089
And he has hordes of demon helpers, that makes him more dangerous too.

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:24.930
Do you think it would be possible for a demon to block one of Jehovah's good angels?

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.170
Well be careful how he answered that.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:35.110
Daniel chapter 10, verse 13, talks about the demon prince of Persia blocking for 21 days

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.550
Jehovah's good angel.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.990
Now how was that possible?

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.829
Well we don't know for sure, but perhaps the demon prince before becoming a demon had been

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:47.870
a cherub or a serif.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.149
And maybe the one sent on the assignment a messenger angel.

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:57.269
Of course Michael came to help the good angel and he was able to get past that demon.

00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:03.069
But that scripture in others helped us not to underestimate the demons.

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:10.430
We can't underestimate the ruler of the demons nor these demons that work under his supervision.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:17.110
So adding it up, we find that Satan is a premeditated murderer.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.629
He's highly intelligent.

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:25.589
He has great anger because of his great reduction of sphere of movement and because of his

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:27.550
expiration of time.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.310
And he has hordes of demon helpers.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.750
Now Jehovah's given us all this information.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:39.750
Not to just fill up pages in the Bible, but so we are determined to recognize the enemy

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:46.949
we're up against and we're determined to fight even harder so that we can be victorious.

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:51.870
But now let's take a little time to get to know our enemy's strategy.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.870
Again, thanks to Jehovah we're not in the dark are we?

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:05.310
Second Corinthians 211 so that we may not be overreached by Satan for we are not ignorant

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.389
of his designs.

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:09.310
Why are we not ignorant?

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:17.269
Well very kind of Jehovah is exposed the full spectrum of saints, designs, his strategies,

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:18.269
his maneuvers.

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:22.189
He's exposed all of them in his word, the Bible.

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:24.949
Now that's very kind of Jehovah, isn't it?

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:31.110
Very kind of Jehovah, even though the Bible was written, the completion of it over 1900

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.549
years ago, Jehovah 100 years, let's say after the Bible has been written, he doesn't come

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:44.350
to the realization, oh no, I forgot to put one of Satan's tricks in the Bible.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.070
Oh no, my people won't be ready for it.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:53.629
No, Jehovah has exposed every one of them say in his word the Bible.

00:08:53.629 --> 00:09:00.509
Not two basic categories, does God's word indicate that Satan's strategies can be divided

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:01.509
into?

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:04.269
Well first we have the frontal attack.

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:11.710
Now that's characterized by banning, imprisonment, threats and acts of violence such as it was

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:18.950
used in our brothers in Malawi in the past and is being used today in Russia on our brothers.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.309
And you don't have to scratch your head and say I wonder if I'm being persecuted.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.990
And you have the frontal attack, it's obvious, isn't it?

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:32.990
It's clear, see, the frontal attack has this proved to be Satan's most successful method

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.990
of attack.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.750
No, not really.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:42.590
Here's just one experience of thousands that could be related to substantiate this point.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:50.190
Now this experience centers around the 29 year old brother named August Dicman.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:55.070
You probably remember this experience, but he was put in Soxon House and concentration

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.509
camp, 1937.

00:09:57.509 --> 00:10:06.149
But then two days or three days after World War II began, 1939, he was ordered to sign

00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:09.669
his military induction slip.

00:10:09.669 --> 00:10:11.590
Of course he refused to do that.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.190
Now the camp commander was furious.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:23.789
So he got permission from Himmler, the head of the SS guard, to publicly execute August

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:26.870
in front of all the camp inmates.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:32.230
And he arranged a special assembly after he got this permission.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.710
And he had Jehovah's Witnesses right down front where they would get the full impact

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.710
of the execution of our dear brother.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:45.230
Well after he was executed, all the other inmates were dismissed.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.870
But Jehovah's Witnesses had to stay.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:54.830
And with great enthusiasm, the camp commander said to the witnesses there, he said, who

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.070
is now ready to sign the declaration?

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:05.710
Well, not one of more than 400 witnesses responded.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:13.990
But then to step forward, no, not to sign, but to ask that their signatures given about

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:18.029
a year earlier, the annulled.

00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:20.990
What a slap in Satan's face.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.590
And that really illustrates the poor success rate of this frontal attack.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.110
And many other experiences could be related.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.070
And it's certainly proving true of our brothers in Russia today, including elderly ones.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:39.190
The frontal attack, a very poor success rate, slap in Satan's face.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:47.629
But now what is the second category of strategy that sadly has claimed many spiritual victims?

00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:51.269
Let's go to Ephesians chapter 6.

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:59.870
And here we can identify, in verse 11, this second category, put on the complete suit

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:09.029
of armor from God, so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:10.429
the devil.

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:18.070
So notice that crafty sneaky, underhanded, devious, Satan uses these, and he's brought

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:23.070
down many away from Jehovah out of the truth.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:29.230
These crafty acts remind me of an illustration years ago in one of our publications of a

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:34.070
soldier who was looking in the distance for the enemy to come over the horizon.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.590
He was looking for the frontal attack.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.669
But he wasn't looking in the rocks down by seat.

00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:44.230
There was a poisonous snake lurking, and that powerfully made the point you have to watch

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.549
yes for the frontal attack.

00:12:46.549 --> 00:12:53.230
But especially the snake in the rocks attacks of the devil that can really bring you down

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.389
without you realizing what has happened.

00:12:56.389 --> 00:13:03.029
But Jehovah ushers us, we can succeed and try up things over both of these categories

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:04.029
of attacks.

00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:11.710
In fact, Psalm 9, 113, a beautiful thought he says, and Jehovah ushers, you will trample

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:19.470
underfoot the main lion and the big snake.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:25.029
And the inside book explains that apparently in that scripture, the main lion represents

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:29.230
the frontal attack, the open attacks of Satan.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.669
Whereas the big snake represents the sneaky crafty acts of the devil.

00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:40.629
But Jehovah says, you will trample both of them underfoot, so we can be successful over

00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:41.629
both of them.

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:44.710
Well, what are some of these snake-like crafty acts?

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.309
Well, let's just discuss two examples.

00:13:48.309 --> 00:13:50.830
Here's one, materialism.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:58.269
Now this is brought down many elders, ministerial servants, pioneers, publishers, very successful

00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:59.669
crafty act of the devil.

00:13:59.669 --> 00:14:08.509
It's no coincidence that this world is powerfully geared to promote materialism.

00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:16.190
Relentless advertising messages are designed to indoctrinate deeply the idea that acquiring

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:23.509
abundant material possessions and acquiring happiness are inseparably linked and directly

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:24.509
proportional.

00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:29.470
That's really the message the world gives, isn't that true?

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:34.870
And if we're not careful, we can begin to think like this advertising messages wants

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:41.990
to think that we're a poor, poor loser if we don't acquire abundant material things.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.990
So what can happen?

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.590
We can get sucked into this little by little.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.870
We buy one item, no problem.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.149
We can handle that.

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:51.149
We buy something else.

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:55.350
Well, now we need to work a little bit of overtime to make the payments.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.870
We keep buying.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.190
Now we need to take a second job.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:04.190
Little by little we're missing meetings, service, less time for personal study, the more

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.669
important things, and little by little.

00:15:07.669 --> 00:15:11.590
We could call Satan the God of gradualism.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.190
We'll take us away from Jehovah by means of materialism.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.110
Well, here's one more example.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.549
Bad Association.

00:15:20.549 --> 00:15:28.149
First Corinthians 1533, Jehovah says, do not be misled.

00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:33.149
Bad associations spoil useful habits.

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:34.509
We might try to mislead ourselves.

00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:35.509
Oh, I can handle it.

00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:37.470
I'm strong enough.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.470
Maybe I'll even bring this person into the truth.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.669
Or others may try to mislead us.

00:15:42.669 --> 00:15:46.149
But Jehovah says, do not be misled.

00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:49.350
And then he gives the terrible consequences.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.429
Think of this illustration.

00:15:51.429 --> 00:16:00.350
If you lock a man and a skunk in a closet, when they come out, will the skunk smell like

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.350
the man?

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.590
Or will the man smell like the skunk?

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.789
Well, you know the answer.

00:16:06.789 --> 00:16:12.149
And Jehovah knows he works the same way with bad association.

00:16:12.149 --> 00:16:16.909
Well those are just two examples of crafty acts of the devil.

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:21.350
Many others, they're all exposed though, as we said before, Jehovah kindly has done

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.350
that.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.350
But now think of this.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.350
Think of this illustration.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:31.470
If you're walking in darkness with a loving friend, and he shines at a flashlight on

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.309
a trap that is right in front of you.

00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:38.350
Is the light of that flashlight removed the trap?

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.350
No.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.110
It just shows you where it is.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.029
Now it's up to us to go around the trap.

00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:45.029
Isn't that true?

00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:49.909
How foolish to go ahead and step in that trap that our friend has illuminated.

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:53.110
Well Jehovah is the friend in that illustration.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.149
But we have to do our part, don't we?

00:16:56.149 --> 00:17:04.549
Well we thus far discussed our evil enemy, his sinister strategy which Jehovah's exposed.

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:07.869
But now what do we have to defend ourselves?

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:12.829
One major component of our defenses is knowledge.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:19.990
See what we've just discussed knowing our enemy, knowing his strategy, and then why is

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:26.069
they utilizing that knowledge, provides a real protection for us.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:31.390
There's a saying to be forewarned is to be forearmed.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:39.710
Similarly, Proverbs chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 says in part, acquire wisdom, acquire

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.230
understanding, and it will protect you.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:51.309
But now additionally we have our spiritual armor, Ephesians 6, 12 and 13 says in part, that

00:17:51.309 --> 00:17:58.430
we have a struggle against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:05.670
For this reason, take up the complete suit of armor from God so that you may be able

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.869
to resist and stand firm.

00:18:09.869 --> 00:18:15.390
We've had some beautiful watch star study articles recently about each of those six

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:21.829
pieces of that armor and how we can put on and keep on each piece of the armor.

00:18:21.829 --> 00:18:25.829
Without our armor, we are defenseless.

00:18:25.829 --> 00:18:34.240
Maybe like a soldier on a raging battlefield dressed only in his underwear.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.799
How long do you think he would survive minutes if that long?

00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:43.079
And not only do we need the armor, we need every piece of the armor.

00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:48.559
That's what Ephesians 6, 13 says, the complete suit of armor.

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:52.759
One piece of armor missing could be tragic.

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:54.200
Now let's illustrate this.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.079
Let's say a soldier forgets to put on his boot like sandals.

00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:05.440
He goes out onto this raging battlefield and he steps on a long, sharp thorn just as

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.240
he's attacked by an enemy soldier who is going to win.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.319
Well, it's obvious.

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:13.119
We need every piece of the armor.

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:19.920
Additionally, an indispensable part of our defense system is Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.960
Backer I-46.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:31.960
The thought is made not by military force nor by power, but by my spirit says Jehovah

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.960
of armies.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.880
See, we don't fight this battle in our own strength.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.519
We have to have Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:42.200
And if we have Holy Spirit, we're empowered by it.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:48.440
If we think about it, there is no breaking point to our integrity.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.960
You probably have heard the illustration of the straw that broke the camel's back.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.039
And literally with a camel, you could keep piling more and more weight.

00:19:58.039 --> 00:20:01.119
That finally, you could put so much weight just a little more weight, you could break

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:02.119
his back.

00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:06.240
Say, you could do that to us, Cunning, if we were on our own.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.119
But Jehovah knows when we've done our part, we've gone as far as our imperfect flesh

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:12.119
will take us.

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:17.480
And then he steps in and makes up any deficit.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.680
St. Paul's more, Jehovah makes up the shortfall.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.480
St. Paul's more, Jehovah makes us equal to that challenge.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:32.279
And since Jehovah's the Almighty, there is literally no breaking point to our integrity.

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:38.920
In fact, one brother living in a band country refused to violate his Christian neutrality,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:45.480
so he was stripped naked, forced to lie face down, and ruthlessly beaten for six hours

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.039
on his back and his legs.

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.400
Spectators fainted with so ruthless.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.160
But yet here's what that brother said sometime later.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:21:00.920
He said, regardless of the amount of insulting and beatings that we received, a few seconds

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.559
would pass.

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:07.480
And we would not feel anything more, even though the beatings continued.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.640
We were feeling that Jehovah God was always with us.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.599
Well, there we have three aspects of our defense system.

00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:21.400
There are others, but we discuss we have God-given knowledge.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.519
See, we know our enemy, we know his strategy, we know what we have to defend ourselves.

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:32.119
But then we have our spiritual armor, and we have Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:38.960
If we do our part, unquestionably, Jehovah always does his part.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.039
And this combination is going to be uncarkable.

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:49.240
So as the battle intensifies, in our individual cases, we're not going to have to turn and

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:56.759
cowardly flee, we'll be able to stand our ground, we'll be able to bravely fight.

00:21:56.759 --> 00:22:03.920
And with Jehovah's help, we will come off completely victorious in the face of St.
