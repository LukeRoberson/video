00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.879
Our previous talk reminded us that it's possible for a family to enjoy peace.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.880
But it takes work.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.880
Let's look at one more step that can help us stay on the road to peace, and that is good communication.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.879
A family promotes peace when all the family members communicate in an open, calm, and honest manner.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.879
But how does communication help with peace?

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:32.880
Well, a pattern of good communication keeps the family close.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.880
It helps us to identify and address problems before these reach a point that they take peace away.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
Now that may seem obvious.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.880
But isn't it true that we may find that between work and school and meetings and ministry and recreation and just life in general

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.880
that it's hard to find time to communicate as a family?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
Is that a challenge in your family?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:12.390
In the following dramatization, notice what habits hinder family communication.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.390
Hey Steve.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.469
Yeah, I'm sorry I was late to the meeting.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.469
I should have been there to help out with my assignment.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:30.299
Yeah, we got delayed.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.299
For late.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:39.310
Let's go, kids.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.310
Yeah, family's fine.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.310
Everybody's adjusting really well.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.659
Anyone see my glasses?

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.290
Anyone?

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:04.340
I mean, we might be a little out of sync, but I don't know.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.860
Every family has their issues, right?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.500
You going outside now?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500
Hey, well, thanks for understanding.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.500
All right.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500
Okay, take care.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.500
All right, bye-bye.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:59.930
Did you notice some habits that hinder family communication?

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.930
In the case of this family, it seems like technology is stifling their communication.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.930
And they obviously have some things they need to communicate about,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.930
punctuality, dress and grooming, but it's not happening.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.930
Now, while the scenes of them all looking at their devices and ignoring one another

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.930
may have been a bit humorous,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.930
did it remind you of your family at times?

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.930
What a good reminder for us not to let the use of technology rob our family

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.930
of our time and attention.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.930
So how can we develop habits that promote good communication?

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.930
Well, let's consider the second Bible principle of this symposium.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.930
Let's turn together.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.930
Please do Ephesians chapter 5 and let's read verses 15 and 16.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.930
Ephesians 5, 15 and 16.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.930
So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.930
but as wise persons, making the best use of your time

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.930
days are wicked.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.930
Now let's look at two ways that this Bible principle can help us.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.930
The first is by making time to have meaningful communication.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.930
Did you notice there in verse 16?

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.930
It says, making the best use of your time.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.930
Now the study note for this phrase indicates the need to buy out the time for important things

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.930
from other pursuits.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.930
So how can this apply to family communication?

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.930
Well, this could include having a plan or a routine for when we spend time

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.930
together as a family each day.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.930
And during those times we may choose to limit our use of technology

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.930
so it does not interfere with communication.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.930
Perhaps it's in the evening or at a specific meal time.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.930
One brother named Aaron stated,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.930
we have our evening meal together which allows us time to talk

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.930
and hear what's important to each member of the family.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.930
He says, my wife and I have arranged our schedules

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.930
so we take the boys to school and pick them up.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.930
This allows us to spend more time with them.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.930
Then he says, my wife and I regularly take walks

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.930
and freely talk about our concern.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.930
What's the point?

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.930
Well, they're making good use of their time.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.930
However, to do this they had to buy that time out from other pursuits

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.930
but they have a plan, they have a routine.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:38.930
So what plan or routine does your family have for meaningful communication each day?

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.930
If you don't have one, can you start now?

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.930
Let's look at the second way that this Bible principle can help us.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.930
And that is by determining when and how to deal with problems

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.930
when they do arise.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.930
You notice verse 15 in Ephesians chapter 5 says,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.930
we should walk as wise persons.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.930
That means we need to choose our paths carefully,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.930
knowing when to go, when to stop, when to take another route.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.930
How can that help us when problems arise?

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.930
Well, a wise person generally knows when is

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.930
and when is not a good time to address a problem.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.930
For example, we all can attest that when emotions are high,

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.930
it's probably not the best time to bring up an issue.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.930
One father states, sometimes we need to wait and let things cool.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.930
Often the nights rest with prayer make a big difference

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.930
when we address the issue the next morning.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.930
That's a wise person.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.930
A wise person also listens.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.930
James chapter 1 verse 19 reminds us to be quick to listen,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.930
slow to speak and slow to anger.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.930
So thus we can go to Jehovah and Prayer and ask them to help us

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.930
to really listen, to stay calm, to stay humble.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.930
One sister named Don states,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.930
when there are problems, the first thing I do is ask Jehovah and Prayer

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.930
to help us resolve the problem calmly.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.930
Then she says, then we talk with the family member privately

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.930
and really try to listen to their side of the issue.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.930
That's a wise person.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.930
A wise person will also consider the approach and the words

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.930
that he or she uses.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.930
For example, rather than telling our family member

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.930
that they have a problem, can we turn it around

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.930
that it's something that we all need to work on together?

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.930
Do you reassure your family members

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.930
that you really love them

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.930
and you want to understand their side of the issue

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.930
or the problem?

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.930
So now doing this, we're not attacking the family member

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.930
but rather showing that we're all in this together.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.930
So we see benefits of this Bible principle

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.930
in communication in our family, don't we?

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.930
You notice the two points.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.930
Number one, making the best use of our time

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.930
and number two, walking as wise persons.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.930
Now communication will always be a work in progress

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.930
but it's worth the effort

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.930
as it'll go a long way to bringing peace to your family.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.930
Let's watch more of our dramatization

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.930
and notice the benefits of developing habits

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.930
that promote good communication.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:36.509
I don't know.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:37.509
What do you think?

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:39.509
We all have to work on it.

00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:41.509
I know I need to.

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:44.509
Why don't we approach it that way with the kids?

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:46.509
Just be open with them.

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:48.509
That sounds like a good idea.

00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:56.889
Okay, so Irene and I have been talking about communication

00:08:56.889 --> 00:08:58.889
in our family.

00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:00.889
We want to talk about our phones

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:02.889
and other devices.

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:04.889
You're not talking about me, are you?

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:05.889
You can't do that.

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:07.889
I know that we can all be more balanced

00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:09.889
but you can't take them away.

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:11.889
I haven't done anything bad.

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:12.889
I have responsibilities.

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:14.889
You're always on your phone too.

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:17.889
It's okay. Let's just talk about it.

00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:21.460
All right.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:30.429
Sue, can you read Ephesians 5, 15, and 16 for us, please?

00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:34.429
So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:36.429
but as wise persons,

00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:39.429
making the best use of your time

00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:41.429
because the days are wicked.

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:45.779
So how do you think we're doing

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:56.169
with our phones and other devices?

00:09:56.169 --> 00:09:59.169
It isn't that what you're doing on your devices is wrong.

00:09:59.169 --> 00:10:03.169
Exactly, but could it be taking time away

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.169
from more important things?

00:10:05.169 --> 00:10:07.169
Like talking to each other?

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:12.830
And in that way affecting even how we're talking to each other?

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:20.240
Yeah.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.490
I think it'd be smart to have some boundaries then.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:31.929
Yeah, okay.

00:10:31.929 --> 00:10:35.230
Okay.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.610
Okay?

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.610
Let's talk about how we can do that.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:46.309
I love you.

00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:47.309
Hey.

00:10:47.309 --> 00:10:53.580
Evidently, I haven't figured out how to talk to her about her clothes yet.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.580
I need your help.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.580
I got this one.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:02.940
I know.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.940
But it's all about good spiritual judgment.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.940
Do you think that these trends reflect Jehovah's view of respectable dress?

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:24.269
I know that you'll do the right thing.

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:27.840
While we're all here,

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.840
I know we all have different views on punctuality.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.840
But I really need your help

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.840
so I can take care of some of my responsibilities.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.840
You think we can meet in the middle?

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.309
Yeah.

00:11:42.309 --> 00:11:43.309
All right.

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:44.309
Great.

00:11:44.309 --> 00:12:09.019
Now this symposium has been discussing four Bible principles

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:11.019
that can guide families to peace.

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:14.019
A brother-dellinger considered the first one

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:16.019
in Romans 12 to 12, verse 10.

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:18.019
And in this part,

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:23.019
we considered Ephesians chapter 5, verses 15 and 16.

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:27.019
Now, did we see how this scripture helped our family in the video?

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:29.019
Well, we saw that they knew down deep

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:33.019
that they were not making the best use of their time.

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:34.019
So they may changes.

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:37.019
They saw that they needed to set boundaries

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:40.019
so they could improve their communication.

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:42.019
And we also saw how the family,

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:44.019
the parents, acted as wise persons.

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:45.019
How?

00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:48.019
Well, by determining when and how

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:51.019
to address the problems that needed to be addressed,

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:53.019
such as the use of technology,

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:57.019
dress in grooming and punctuality.

00:12:57.019 --> 00:13:00.019
Well, can this Bible principle help your family,

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:03.019
help my family to improve communication?

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:05.019
And would this be a good scripture

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:09.019
to include in your next family worship?

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:12.019
Now, it takes time to learn how to communicate well

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:14.019
as a family.

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:17.019
But it is worth the effort.

00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:18.019
Why?

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:22.019
Well, if we strive to communicate well each day,

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:27.019
then communication will come more readily when there are problems.

00:13:27.019 --> 00:13:30.019
So be determined to look for ways

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:33.019
to improve communication in your family.

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:36.019
And by taking this initiative and sticking with it,

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:41.019
you will be following the roadmap to family peace.

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:44.019
Please listen out to Brother David Splane,

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:46.019
a member of the governing body,

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:49.019
as he considers the next talk of this symposium,

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:54.019
follow the roadmap to family peace, work as a team.
