00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.820
It's not always easy to be a Christian in the world that we are living in.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.820
For us to go on walking in the truth, we need a strong faith.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.820
Especially, do we need a strong faith in Jesus' resurrection?

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.820
It's really key to everything that we believe in.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.820
If Jesus was not resurrected, then everything falls apart for us.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.820
Paul said it perfectly in 1 Corinthians 15.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.820
In verse 17, he said,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.820
Further, if Christ was not raised up, your faith is useless.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.820
You remain in your sins.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.820
But if Christ was not raised up, then this life is all there is.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.820
If Christ was not raised up, then he never went to heaven.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.819
He never stood in front of his father and handed over the value of his sacrifice.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:10.819
Then the ransom was not paid, or as Paul said,

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.819
You remain in your sins.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.819
Then there is no forgiveness for sins.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.819
Then there will not be a resurrection.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.819
There is not going to be life or everlasting life for any of us.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:30.819
If Christ was not raised up, then your faith is useless.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:41.819
For us, a strong faith in Jesus' resurrection is really key for us to go on walking in the truth.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.819
Why is it that we can be sure that Jesus was resurrected?

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.819
If you still have your Bible open here to 1 Corinthians 15,

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.819
we find one of the proofs here in verse 3 through 8.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.819
I'm not going to read it all, but just point out that in verse 3,

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.819
it says that Christ died in verse 4, that he was raised up on the third day.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.819
Verse 5, he appeared to see this.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.819
And to the 12th, in verse 6, appeared to 500 brothers at one time.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.819
And most of them was still alive, some had died.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.819
In verse 7, he appeared to James, and in verse 8, also to Paul.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.819
There are witnesses, there are lots of witnesses.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.819
The 12th, 500, James, and also Paul.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.819
Are they reliable witnesses?

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.819
After all, we can't talk to them.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.819
I would have liked to bring them in here one other time and ask them some questions.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.819
My first question would be, did you personally see Jesus resurrected?

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.819
How close were you? Could you hear his voice?

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.819
Close enough that you could touch him?

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.819
Are you really sure that you saw Jesus resurrected?

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.819
I mean, that's not going to happen, but we can't ask him any questions.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.819
But is there any way we can know if they were really sure

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.819
that they had seen Jesus resurrected?

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.819
Yeah, there is.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.819
Because of the way they lived their life after Jesus' resurrection,

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.819
we know that they were sure that they had seen him resurrected.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.819
Take the apostles.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.819
After Jesus' resurrection, now they live a life where they are persecuted.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.819
Some of them even executed.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.819
I mean, do you think that they would be willing to live a life in persecution

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.819
and being executed if they were not sure?

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.819
But they did go through that because they were sure that they had seen Jesus resurrected.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.819
Or take the 500.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.819
Paul mentioned that at the time when he wrote this, most of them was still alive.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.819
And we know that just a few years later, severe persecution broke out.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.819
Many were sent to the arenas.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.819
Some were burned alive.

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:24.819
I mean, would they be willing to go through that if they were not sure?

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:31.819
But they did go through that because they had seen Jesus resurrected.

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.819
James was also mentioned.

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.819
Likely, this is Jesus' half-brother, James.

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:45.819
Because we know from John 7.5 that Jesus' brothers had no faith in Jesus.

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:51.819
In Mark 3.21, they even went as far as saying that he has gone out of his mind.

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.819
So Jesus' brothers had no faith in Jesus.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.819
And then Jesus appeared to James.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.819
And he changed.

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:01.819
Now he had faith.

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:03.819
And the brothers had faith.

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.819
In Acts 1.14, Jesus' brothers are mentioned together with the congregation.

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.819
They are praying with the congregation.

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.819
I mean, they were unbelievers.

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.819
Jesus appeared to them or appeared to James.

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:22.129
And they became believers.

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.129
And then there's Paul.

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.129
Paul referred to himself in verse 8.

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:36.129
But last of all, he appeared also to me as to one born prematurely.

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.129
So what about Paul?

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:43.129
Did he really believe that he had seen Jesus resurrected?

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:44.129
Yeah, he did.

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.129
Do you think of how he changed his life?

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.129
His life was changed upside down.

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:55.129
You could say that before this,

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:00.129
he was living in the upper circles of society of his day.

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.129
Or he lived on first class.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:08.129
Then he saw Jesus resurrected and everything changed for him.

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:14.129
We find a description of it in 1 Corinthians 11 and verse 23.

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.129
1 Corinthians 11, 23 through 27.

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.129
Again, I'm not going to read all of it.

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.129
There's some...

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.129
He mentioned that he was imprisoned often.

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.129
Accountless beatings.

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.129
Many near death.

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.129
Five times 40 strokes.

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:35.129
Less one.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.129
Three times beaten with rods.

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.129
Stone, shipwrecked.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.129
Endangers from rivers.

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:43.129
From rubbers.

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:44.129
From our own people.

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:46.129
Endangers from the nations.

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:48.129
Endangers in the city.

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.129
Wilderness at sea among false brothers.

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.129
In labor and toil.

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.129
In sleepless nights often.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:58.129
In hunger and thirst.

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:00.129
Frequently without food.

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.129
In cold and lacking clothing.

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.129
I mean, who wants to live a life like this?

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:10.129
Do you think Paul would be willing...

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:14.129
You know, he went from first class to living a life like this.

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:19.129
Would he be willing to do that if he wasn't sure?

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:25.129
But he went through all of this because he had seen Jesus resurrected.

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:30.410
I mean, these witnesses, they are solid.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.410
They can be believed.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:39.410
The life they lived after seeing Jesus resurrected proved that they were absolutely sure.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.410
They had seen Jesus resurrected.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.410
So what does that mean for us?

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.410
Well, everything.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.410
If we go back to Paul's words there in 1 Corinthians 15, 17,

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.410
well, then our faith is not useless.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.410
Jesus was resurrected.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.410
He went to heaven.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.410
He appeared in front of his father.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.410
He handed over the value of his sacrifice.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.410
The ransom was paid.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.410
So then there's forgiveness for sins.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.410
There's going to be a resurrection.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.410
There's going to be a new world.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.410
It's going to be life and everlasting life.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.410
I mean, this is going to happen.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.410
All of it is going to happen.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:29.410
It's guaranteed by a Jesus' resurrection.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:35.980
It also means that we can go on walking in the choose no matter what comes our way.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.980
We saw what happened to the 12th and to the 500.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.980
But because they had a strong faith in Jesus' resurrection,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.980
they could endure even persecution.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:53.379
Hopefully we won't have to go through everything that Paul went through,

00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:57.379
but we know that we have difficult days ahead of us.

00:08:57.379 --> 00:09:01.379
But because we have a strong faith in Jesus' resurrection,

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:05.379
we can go on walking in the truth.

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:08.379
And like our brothers and sisters in the first century,

00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:13.379
we can also endure persecution or even death,

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:18.379
because we know that there's going to be a resurrection.
