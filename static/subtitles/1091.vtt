WEBVTT

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.519
Greetings, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.320
Welcome to this special edition of JW Broadcasting,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.919
originating from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:20.559
Our programs this month and next will feature the entire regional convention program for 2020.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:26.640
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in cancellations of gatherings around the world,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.979
Jehovah continues to provide spiritual food at the proper time.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:40.179
At the time this program was recorded, local governments had already mandated social distancing.

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:45.979
In compliance, we filmed the entire convention program without an audience,

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.649
and we are pleased to present it to you now.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:57.350
In behalf of the governing body and all the brothers and sisters working unitedly here at World Headquarters,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.549
it's my pleasure to extend to every one of you a very warm welcome.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.250
Our convention program this year has, as its theme, always rejoice,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.849
and our theme scripture for this opening day is Philippians 4-4.

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:21.049
Always rejoice in the Lord, again I will say rejoice.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.349
This first session of our convention begins with a music video presentation.

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:32.900
This video highlights the joy we experience when we gather together for worship.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.700
If you have with you a cellular telephone or other electronic device,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.799
please adjust it to a setting that will not disturb others.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.900
And now please enjoy the presentation.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:11:56.879
We are delighted that you could join us for this opening session of the Always Rejoice Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:04.480
Please stand as we sing together song number 111 entitled Our Reasons for Joy.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.679
After the song, you may pause the program for your local opening prayer.

00:12:09.679 --> 00:14:35.679
Again, that song number 111, please be seated.

00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:40.279
Is it realistic for us to rejoice at all times?

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:44.840
If so, how is it possible?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.639
Please pay careful attention to Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:54.840
As he directs attention to our source of joy in the talk,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:04.570
why Jehovah is the happy God?

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:12.169
Welcome to the 2020 Always Rejoice Regional Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:19.370
From the start, we wish to convey to you greetings from the governing body and the entire Bethel family.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.669
And we want you to know that we love you and we keep you in our prayers.

00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:29.269
So now, whether you are watching this from home or from some other location,

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:34.070
this is our convention for 2020.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.169
And what an encouraging theme.

00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:38.269
Always rejoice.

00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:43.669
We need to discuss this subject now more than ever before, don't we?

00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:47.970
Is it possible to rejoice as the world crumbles around us?

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.470
Yes, it is.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:54.269
Those who love Jehovah can always find reasons to rejoice.

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:59.970
Throughout this convention, we will discuss four things that will help us to rejoice.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.669
What are they?

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:06.669
Number one, we will consider the reasons we have for rejoicing.

00:16:06.669 --> 00:16:11.269
Two, we will examine how we can cultivate godly joy.

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:16.070
Three, we will look at how we can maintain joy despite trials.

00:16:16.169 --> 00:16:20.169
And four, we will discuss how to express joy.

00:16:20.169 --> 00:16:24.669
That is the joy we receive from serving Jehovah.

00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:30.169
Now, let's lay the foundation for all of this by first answering the question,

00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:33.169
what is true joy?

00:16:33.169 --> 00:16:38.970
What is commonly called joy is an emotion that is stirred by a feeling of well-being,

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.169
by a sense of success, or because of expecting something good.

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:50.669
And for this reason, joy may seem to come and go depending on what is happening around us.

00:16:50.669 --> 00:16:54.269
You might call it circumstantial joy,

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:56.870
but that is not the case with true joy.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.269
Why?

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:05.569
Because true joy, godly joy, is an aspect of the fruitage of God's Holy Spirit.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:12.769
True joy is a quality of the heart that is not dependent on external things happening around us.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:16.970
This godly quality comes from knowing that you have the truth,

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.670
that you are doing what pleases God,

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.569
and that your kingdom hope is certain to be fulfilled.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:29.069
So then, we see there's a big difference between having circumstantial joy

00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:32.069
and having joy of Holy Spirit.

00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:38.269
This is illustrated for us in the Scriptures by the example of the Christians in Thessalonica.

00:17:38.269 --> 00:17:41.970
The Apostle Paul and others helped them to prepare ahead of time

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:47.269
to face persecution with joy and prepare they did.

00:17:47.269 --> 00:17:48.269
How?

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:51.670
They became strong in faith.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:58.470
Let's read about what this did for them at first Thessalonians chapter 1 and verse 6.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.269
As we read the verse, ask yourself,

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:04.769
where did their deep-seated joy come from?

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:06.470
The verse reads,

00:18:35.569 --> 00:18:47.170
Godly joy is not a mere personality trait that we are born with then, is it?

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.970
And it doesn't come to us simply because of pleasant circumstances.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:56.069
Joy of Holy Spirit is found deep within us,

00:18:56.069 --> 00:19:01.470
and so it should not be confused with simply being cheerful or exuberant.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.369
Godly joy is not superficial.

00:19:04.369 --> 00:19:10.369
It's not found in constantly smiling or laughing to show the difference.

00:19:10.369 --> 00:19:14.369
Think of a comedian who seems to be able to find what is funny

00:19:14.369 --> 00:19:17.569
in just about any situation in life.

00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:22.769
Yet deep down inside, he may be very unhappy.

00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:26.470
In contrast, like the Christians in Thessalonica,

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:32.069
we can have joy of Holy Spirit even when we are under tribulation.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.769
We may not smile through a bad time,

00:19:34.769 --> 00:19:39.769
but our deep inner joy in serving Jehovah is immovable.

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:46.670
It's part of the new personality that true Christians put on in order to be like Christ.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.170
Now, with this basic understanding of Godly joy in mind,

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.369
let's give our attention to Brother Stephen Let,

00:19:54.369 --> 00:20:01.170
a member of the governing body as he welcomes us to this always rejoice convention.

00:20:01.269 --> 00:20:10.119
And please listen carefully as he explains why Godly joy is such a special quality.

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:18.119
Welcome to the always rejoice convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:26.319
We're so happy that you were able to arrange to attend all three days of this convention.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:31.119
Why were the Apostle Paul's words at Philippians 4.4

00:20:31.119 --> 00:20:36.119
chosen as the theme for this year's convention?

00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:41.920
Well, over the past four years, the governing body has used conventions

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:48.119
to highlight qualities that endear us to Jehovah

00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:56.119
and help us to be victorious in our struggle against Satan and his world.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:02.920
We've had convention themes that focused on the need for loyalty,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:11.420
endurance, courage, and love.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:17.420
This year, the convention theme highlights the need for joy.

00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:26.819
At Nehemiah 8.10, we're told the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:33.619
In the near future, our faith will be tested as never before.

00:21:33.619 --> 00:21:38.420
But if we acquire true joy with the help of God's Holy Spirit,

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:46.720
we will be able to stand firm and weather all the storms that come our way.

00:21:46.819 --> 00:21:52.019
Godly joy is a deep-seated quality of the heart.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:22:00.519
It's a state of happiness that remains whether the conditions around us are pleasant or not.

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:05.319
In fact, a person can be disturbed about something,

00:22:05.319 --> 00:22:10.019
but still have joy in his heart.

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:15.720
For example, the Apostles were flogged for speaking about the Christ.

00:22:15.819 --> 00:22:20.319
Yet they went out from before the Sanadran rejoicing

00:22:20.319 --> 00:22:27.319
because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.

00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:33.119
Obviously, they weren't rejoicing over the flogging they had received,

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:42.519
but as servants of God, they found true joy in keeping their integrity to him.

00:22:42.519 --> 00:22:49.920
However, is it possible for a Christian always to be rejoicing?

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:58.220
Yes, because true joy is an aspect of the fruitage of God's Holy Spirit.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:04.819
As an inward quality, joy is not dependent on external things,

00:23:04.819 --> 00:23:11.619
not even on our brothers, but it does depend on God's Spirit.

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:17.819
And as already noted, our joy comes from that deep inner satisfaction

00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:21.220
of knowing that we have the truth,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.220
that we're doing what pleases Jehovah,

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.920
and that our kingdom hope is sure.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:34.720
So Godly joy is not the transient joy that people experience

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.619
because they've secured a well-paying job.

00:23:38.619 --> 00:23:44.519
Gone on an exotic vacation, attained fame and prestige,

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:50.619
or acquired some coveted material item, or large sum of money.

00:23:50.619 --> 00:23:52.220
No.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:58.519
True joy has to be cultivated by means of Holy Spirit.

00:23:58.519 --> 00:24:02.720
To obtain Jehovah's Holy Spirit, we have to draw close to him

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.420
and give him exclusive devotion.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:11.819
At Acts 532, we're told that God gives Holy Spirit

00:24:11.819 --> 00:24:16.819
to those obeying him as ruler.

00:24:16.819 --> 00:24:20.920
During these three days, the convention program

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:27.319
will help us to deepen our appreciation for Godly joy.

00:24:27.319 --> 00:24:32.720
We'll learn what true joy is, how to cultivate it,

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.220
how to maintain it during difficult times

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:42.019
and how to display it as it wells up in our hearts.

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:48.119
Such joy will clearly identify us as disciples of Jesus,

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:53.220
and it will enable us to serve as beacons of light

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:59.920
in this dark world and draw others to our happy God.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.519
You'll note that nearly the entire second day

00:25:03.519 --> 00:25:09.119
has been devoted to the joy of disciple making.

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:14.319
Godly joy will help us to face challenges to our integrity.

00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:18.019
Remember that it was the joy that was set before him

00:25:18.019 --> 00:25:24.920
that helped Jesus to face an excruciating death on a torture stake.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.819
So please pay rapt attention to the talks and videos.

00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:34.220
Look up the scriptures and read them along with the speakers.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:42.420
Thus allowing God's Word to exert its powerful force on your heart.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:47.619
May this convention become a milestone in your development

00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:53.619
as a joyful imitator of our happy God.

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:58.819
How thankful we are that He made us in His image,

00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:05.119
giving us the capacity to feel and express Godly joy.

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:10.119
And how thankful we are that He also gives us His Holy Spirit

00:26:10.119 --> 00:26:14.019
to help us cultivate that kind of joy.

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:17.619
We love you very much,

00:26:17.619 --> 00:26:22.819
and we pray that each one of you will forever respond

00:26:22.819 --> 00:26:27.920
to the words of the Psalmist at Psalm 100 verse 2.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.920
Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:39.720
Come into His presence with joyful shouting.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.420
We wish to thank Brother Lead for building up our anticipation

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.720
for this always rejoice convention.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:53.119
As Brother Lead highlighted, Godly joy is indeed a very special quality.

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:56.420
Such true joy comes from Jehovah Himself.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:02.220
In fact, the Bible says that He always has reasons to rejoice.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:08.220
So much so that being happy describes His personality.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:14.220
Let's see this for ourselves as we read 1 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 11.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:19.220
The context in verses 8 through 10 lists many of the bad qualities

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.519
and actions that people of this world display.

00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:28.119
But they can change if they listen to our joyful God Jehovah.

00:27:28.119 --> 00:27:33.420
With that in mind, note the Apostle Paul's inspired words in verse 11

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.720
as he goes on to say,

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.119
according to the glorious good news of the happy God

00:27:40.119 --> 00:27:43.519
with which I was entrusted.

00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:48.220
Why can Jehovah be called happy despite seeing all of the problems

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.220
and suffering on the earth?

00:27:50.319 --> 00:27:55.619
Well, among the many things that may come happy are the following 4.

00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:58.319
1. Jehovah is the Creator.

00:27:58.319 --> 00:28:01.519
Everything He does is perfect.

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:07.019
Due to Ronomy 32 and verse 4 says, perfect is His activity.

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:11.819
For this reason, Jehovah can rightly rejoice in His creation.

00:28:11.819 --> 00:28:18.920
That fact is undeniable and it's clearly stated in Psalm 104 and verse 31.

00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:26.019
As we read it together, consider how determined Jehovah is to keep His joy.

00:28:26.019 --> 00:28:28.720
Verse 31 says,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.920
the glory of Jehovah will last forever.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:37.119
Jehovah will rejoice in His works.

00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:38.619
The point?

00:28:38.619 --> 00:28:40.119
Jehovah will not be denied.

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:44.619
Well, he he will find joy in what he has accomplished.

00:28:44.619 --> 00:28:47.119
No one can take that from him.

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:53.119
He's the happy God whose purpose for man and for the earth will be realized.

00:28:53.119 --> 00:28:56.920
Adding to His happiness is reason number 2.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.720
Jehovah is generous and we know what the Bible says about those who give.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:08.519
And aren't we grateful for all that Jehovah is providing to help us and support us now

00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:11.819
through a very difficult time?

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.920
Number 3.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.720
Jehovah's heart is made glad by the faithfulness of His servants.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.220
He never forgets all that we have done.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.319
At Proverbs 23, 15, he says,

00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:26.720
if your heart becomes wise,

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.519
then my own heart will rejoice.

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.619
If we remain faithful to Jehovah,

00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:38.220
the joy that we can bring to Him will last forever.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.119
And number 4.

00:29:40.119 --> 00:29:42.319
Because Jehovah is perfect,

00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:44.619
He always does what is right.

00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:49.920
He will never do anything to spoil His own happiness.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.420
Well, now that we have looked at what makes Jehovah the happy God,

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.220
we want to know what makes us happy.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.819
That is what makes us truly happy.

00:29:58.819 --> 00:30:01.920
Deep down inside happy.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.819
After all, it's not difficult to find superficial happiness.

00:30:06.819 --> 00:30:10.519
For instance, when you're near someone with a funny laugh,

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:13.819
do you often find yourself laughing as well?

00:30:13.819 --> 00:30:15.420
It happens, right?

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.920
You may not even know what you're laughing about, true?

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.519
The point is this,

00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:25.920
it's not all that difficult to experience superficial happiness

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.220
but to find lasting joy, takes effort,

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.819
and it takes appreciation for what we have.

00:30:33.819 --> 00:30:38.619
We will now look at some of the things that bring us real joy.

00:30:38.619 --> 00:30:40.420
And as you might expect,

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.519
it begins with Jehovah.

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:49.720
Our relationship with Jehovah is our foremost reason for joy.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.119
But not just any relationship.

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:59.519
Take note of what is needed as we read Psalm 16 and verse 11.

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:03.519
As we do so first, notice what Jehovah does.

00:31:03.619 --> 00:31:07.819
Next, see what type of relationship we can have with him.

00:31:07.819 --> 00:31:11.819
Then, make the connection to having joy.

00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:16.019
Psalm 16 verse 11 reads,

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:19.220
You make known to me the path of life.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:24.819
In your presence is abundant joy.

00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:28.019
So again, first, what does Jehovah do?

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:31.720
He kindly makes the path of life known to us.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:36.220
Next, what type of relationship can we have with him?

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.619
A very close one, it says,

00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:41.019
as if in his very presence.

00:31:41.019 --> 00:31:45.019
Then, we read that in his presence, there's what?

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:48.019
Abundant joy.

00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:52.619
Now, along with having a close relationship with Jehovah,

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:56.920
as mentioned there, what else brings us joy?

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.119
Jehovah's Holy Spirit does.

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:03.920
His Holy Spirit generates joy in those who receive it.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.619
For this reason, we should pray to receive his Holy Spirit every day.

00:32:08.619 --> 00:32:11.519
What else promotes true joy within us?

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:13.720
Our marvelous hope.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.920
Also, we have an abundance of spiritual food,

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.619
even under difficult circumstances.

00:32:20.619 --> 00:32:24.119
That joyful blessing was foretold in God's Word.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:31.420
To see it, please go to Isaiah chapter 65 and verses 13 and 14.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.720
Now, in these verses,

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.019
Jehovah draws a contrast between good people

00:32:37.019 --> 00:32:43.470
and bad people when he says this starting in verse 13.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:47.170
Therefore, this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah says.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:51.869
Look, my servants will eat, but you will go hungry.

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:57.170
Look, my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:02.470
Look, my servants will rejoice, but you will suffer shame.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.369
Look, my servants will shout joyfully

00:33:05.369 --> 00:33:08.470
because of the good condition of the heart,

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:14.920
but you will cry out because of the pain of heart.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.420
Do you see yourself on Jehovah's side of this contrast?

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.220
If you've been keeping up with God's organization,

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.519
you should feel well fed spiritually.

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:28.519
The bad conditions of this world must not be permitted

00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:31.019
to take away from our joy.

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:33.420
As Jehovah said, we shall joyfully.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.420
Why?

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.920
Because of the good condition of the heart.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.420
We are more ready than ever before

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.619
to see the realization of our hope.

00:33:43.619 --> 00:33:45.220
On the other hand,

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.720
the world around us is suffering

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.819
because they lack clear direction

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.720
and they are without real hope.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.619
Throughout our lives, and especially at times like this,

00:33:57.619 --> 00:34:01.220
we should take note of Jehovah's help.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.119
When we see that Jehovah is helping us,

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:05.920
we know that he is with us.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:11.420
We just know it, and this too brings us immense joy.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.619
Also, we find joy in hearing the expressions of faith

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:19.619
that come from our dear brothers and sisters, don't we?

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:20.719
And this is true,

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:23.820
whether we meet together for worship in person

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.219
or whether we meet by means of video.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:31.519
In fact, with so much to add to our inner joy,

00:34:31.519 --> 00:34:34.119
we can come to have a joy so strong

00:34:34.119 --> 00:34:38.820
and so deep within us that nothing can shake it.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.519
Even persecution, though not enjoyable in itself,

00:34:42.519 --> 00:34:44.159
can lead to joy.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.820
How so?

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.219
As Jesus said, at Matthew 5, 11 and 12,

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:53.420
happy are you when people reproach you

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:57.219
and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

00:34:57.219 --> 00:34:59.420
against you for my sake.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:04.920
Rejoice and be overjoyed since your reward is great.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.119
So how can we be joyful,

00:35:08.119 --> 00:35:10.420
even though we are persecuted

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.519
because when we endure persecution with joy

00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:18.019
and keep our integrity, we gain a victory

00:35:18.019 --> 00:35:20.019
and Jehovah's approval.

00:35:20.019 --> 00:35:23.119
Jesus said, rejoice and be overjoyed

00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:25.320
since your reward is great.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.719
Well, so far we have defined true joy.

00:35:29.719 --> 00:35:33.719
We have examined why Jehovah is called the happy God

00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:35.519
and we have reviewed a number of things

00:35:35.519 --> 00:35:37.920
that bring us godly joy.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.119
But at this point, you may be wondering,

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:44.920
can I really be happy if I am suffering?

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.920
That's a very good question.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.420
So let's look some more at how

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.719
or in what sense we can always rejoice.

00:35:53.719 --> 00:35:56.719
The fact is that at times all of us may be saddened

00:35:56.719 --> 00:36:01.719
by injustice, poor health, unemployment, grief

00:36:01.719 --> 00:36:04.619
or other causes for anxiety,

00:36:04.619 --> 00:36:07.219
such as mankind has experienced

00:36:07.219 --> 00:36:09.719
with this global pandemic

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.920
and many of our brothers and sisters

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.920
have been affected by such things, haven't they?

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.719
Since that is the case,

00:36:16.719 --> 00:36:19.219
let's look at how we can apply the words

00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:23.320
of our convention theme at Philippians chapter four

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.519
and verse four.

00:36:25.619 --> 00:36:30.320
Now, as we read verse four, Philippians four four,

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.119
imagine the Apostle Paul writing this

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:36.719
while he was in prison bonds or chains.

00:36:36.719 --> 00:36:41.519
Yet full of faith, he said this with God's spirit on him.

00:36:42.519 --> 00:36:45.019
Always rejoice in the Lord.

00:36:45.019 --> 00:36:48.119
Again, I will say rejoice.

00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:52.320
Why could Paul say this so emphatically?

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.320
Because the Apostle Paul was a man who had true godly joy.

00:36:58.719 --> 00:37:00.960
Paul had true joy that was not dependent

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.079
on what was happening around him

00:37:03.079 --> 00:37:05.559
or what was happening to him.

00:37:05.559 --> 00:37:07.360
From a heart filled with faith,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.360
he said that he had joy that was focused in or on the Lord.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.559
That is why Paul was joyful

00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:18.760
despite any injustice or anxiety that he experienced.

00:37:19.659 --> 00:37:21.760
Always rejoice, he said.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.659
Again, rejoice.

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:27.960
What will help us to apply these inspired words?

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.460
Well, like Paul, we too can always rejoice

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.920
despite unpleasant circumstances

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.019
when we grow in faith and seek true joy.

00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:39.719
We too seek joy that's not merely the result

00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:43.719
of what happens around us or what happens to us.

00:37:44.719 --> 00:37:47.719
When we pray earnestly for God's spirit,

00:37:47.719 --> 00:37:50.519
He helps us to succeed

00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:52.239
and to keep our deep inner joy,

00:37:52.239 --> 00:37:55.119
no matter what trial we may face.

00:37:55.119 --> 00:38:00.119
Even more than this, we have Jehovah's example to imitate.

00:38:00.719 --> 00:38:05.519
He has maintained his joy despite much heartache.

00:38:05.519 --> 00:38:07.119
What has he endured?

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:11.920
Well, over a period of about 4,000 years,

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.159
Jehovah saw a number of angels

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:16.119
rebel against his sovereignty.

00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:19.320
He saw Adam and Eve rebel.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.320
He watched wickedness spread across the earth.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.320
He saw false worships spread

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.719
and this included what his chosen people,

00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:29.920
what the Israelites did

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.719
as they reverted again and again to apostasy.

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:38.219
Finally, Jehovah saw his enemies,

00:38:38.219 --> 00:38:40.719
put his son to death.

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:44.320
But through it all, though unimaginably painful for him,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.219
Jehovah never lost his deep-seated joy.

00:38:48.219 --> 00:38:51.219
In fact, imagine his joy

00:38:51.219 --> 00:38:54.619
as he watched the vast majority of the angels

00:38:54.619 --> 00:38:56.519
keep their integrity.

00:38:56.519 --> 00:38:58.420
Imagine his joy

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.420
as he watched faithful Israelites

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.219
keep their integrity

00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:04.920
even when faced with death.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.219
And imagine Jehovah's joy

00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:11.119
as he saw thousands turned to following his son

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.420
and become true Christians,

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.920
a number that today reaches into the millions.

00:39:18.019 --> 00:39:21.719
Jehovah has always been able to see the light

00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:22.920
beyond the storm.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.019
May we imitate the happy God

00:39:26.019 --> 00:39:28.719
and count our blessings every day

00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:31.420
even during the most difficult times.

00:39:32.619 --> 00:39:33.719
To help us to do this,

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:36.920
we have an entire convention now to enjoy.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.119
All of it centered on the thought

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:41.719
of always rejoicing.

00:39:41.719 --> 00:39:45.920
This convention includes talks, symposiums, interviews,

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.619
a Bible drama and many videos

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:51.420
that will teach us how to cultivate

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.019
and display joy of Holy Spirit.

00:39:55.019 --> 00:39:57.219
Please look at the convention program

00:39:57.219 --> 00:39:59.920
and let's see what's in store for us.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.219
Our scriptural theme for the first day

00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:05.219
is also our convention theme scripture,

00:40:05.219 --> 00:40:07.219
Philippians 4-4,

00:40:07.219 --> 00:40:08.920
which again says,

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.219
always rejoice in the Lord.

00:40:11.219 --> 00:40:13.820
Again, I will say rejoice.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.619
We have so much to look forward to

00:40:17.619 --> 00:40:20.719
during the first day of this program.

00:40:20.719 --> 00:40:21.820
For instance,

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.119
the opening symposium will show

00:40:24.119 --> 00:40:25.619
that it's Jehovah's advice,

00:40:25.619 --> 00:40:27.420
not the world's wisdom

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.420
that brings true joy when we follow it.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.519
Then the dramatic Bible reading

00:40:32.519 --> 00:40:34.119
will help us to visualize

00:40:34.119 --> 00:40:37.719
the events recorded in the book of Ezra.

00:40:37.719 --> 00:40:38.719
After that,

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:41.019
we will enjoy a faith strengthening review

00:40:41.019 --> 00:40:43.420
of how in the past,

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.719
Jehovah saved his people as a group

00:40:46.719 --> 00:40:49.119
and as individuals.

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:52.320
During this critical time,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.519
it's important for us to take to heart

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:56.519
what we will hear in that talk,

00:40:56.519 --> 00:41:01.820
entitled Rejoice in Jehovah's Acts of Salvation.

00:41:03.019 --> 00:41:05.019
In the afternoon session,

00:41:05.019 --> 00:41:07.019
the second symposium of the day

00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:10.519
will explain how the joy in a family is enhanced

00:41:10.519 --> 00:41:13.019
when each member appreciates

00:41:13.019 --> 00:41:14.820
and cherishes the others.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.019
The last symposium of the day

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:21.320
will show how creation provides convincing proof

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.619
that Jehovah wants us to enjoy life.

00:41:24.619 --> 00:41:27.619
This will be followed by a talk that will discuss

00:41:27.619 --> 00:41:31.119
how we can find more peace and more joy

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:34.820
by avoiding jealousy and competition.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.320
Finally, the first day concludes with a talk

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.619
that will show us how those who truly know Jehovah

00:41:40.619 --> 00:41:42.119
are optimistic,

00:41:42.119 --> 00:41:45.320
they are generous and patient.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.719
As with each part of this convention,

00:41:47.719 --> 00:41:51.320
listen carefully to this talk and titled,

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.619
Close Friendship with Jehovah

00:41:53.619 --> 00:41:56.820
brings the greatest joy.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.519
We now look ahead to the second day

00:41:58.519 --> 00:42:01.119
of our convention program.

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:05.719
The scriptural theme is based on Psalm 105, verse 3.

00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:07.019
And there in verse 3,

00:42:07.019 --> 00:42:10.420
we are encouraged to boast about his holy name,

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:15.820
let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.519
One important way to boast about Jehovah's holy name

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:23.219
is by means of our disciple making work.

00:42:23.219 --> 00:42:26.420
Tying that in with our convention theme,

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.719
the first symposium of the day will leave no doubt

00:42:29.719 --> 00:42:32.920
that our joy increases as our skills

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:36.219
in the disciple making work improve.

00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:39.320
Following this, the second symposium

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.820
will show how we can find joy in the ministry

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.719
when we rely on the help that God gives us for this work.

00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:50.719
The baptism talk will help those soon to get baptized

00:42:50.719 --> 00:42:53.719
to keep in mind what they need to do

00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:58.420
in order to be happy now and forever.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.920
In the afternoon portion of the second day's program,

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.619
you will hear experiences

00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:05.719
during a series of videos that will make you proud

00:43:05.719 --> 00:43:08.820
to be part of our international brotherhood

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.719
of disciple makers.

00:43:11.719 --> 00:43:14.119
The last symposium of day two

00:43:14.119 --> 00:43:16.820
will focus on ways you can help your Bible students

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.119
to overcome their fears

00:43:19.119 --> 00:43:22.920
and experience Jehovah's help and his blessings.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.719
This will be followed by a convention highlight.

00:43:25.719 --> 00:43:28.519
Part one of the Bible drama,

00:43:28.519 --> 00:43:33.119
the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:35.519
After that faith strengthening drama,

00:43:35.519 --> 00:43:39.719
we will enjoy the final talk of the second day entitled,

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.820
Making Disciples Now,

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.320
prepares us for new world disciple making.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.019
This talk will help to increase our enthusiasm,

00:43:49.019 --> 00:43:52.320
not only for the disciple making work of today,

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.920
but also for that yet to come.

00:43:56.519 --> 00:43:59.619
Now we go to the final day of our program.

00:43:59.619 --> 00:44:04.019
With a scriptural theme taken from Psalm 37 verse four,

00:44:04.019 --> 00:44:06.320
the final day focuses our attention

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.519
on what lies at the heart of true joy.

00:44:10.519 --> 00:44:12.719
Psalm 37 four says,

00:44:12.719 --> 00:44:15.920
Find exquisite to light in Jehovah

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.320
and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.420
With Jehovah as our focus,

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.019
we start the day with a seven part symposium

00:44:27.019 --> 00:44:31.320
that will highlight how we can endure trials with joy.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.119
Afterward during the public Bible discourse,

00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:38.820
the speaker will explain what riches God promises

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.320
and how they can be obtained.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.820
In the concluding session of our convention,

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.519
we will be delighted to watch the thrilling climax

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:50.119
of the Bible drama,

00:44:50.119 --> 00:44:54.019
the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:44:54.019 --> 00:44:58.320
Then the convention program will conclude with the talk,

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.019
find exquisite to light in Jehovah.

00:45:02.119 --> 00:45:05.519
We will all benefit as the speaker reviews

00:45:05.519 --> 00:45:09.920
what helps us now and what we have to look forward to

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920
in the future.

00:45:12.619 --> 00:45:15.719
Would you like to see a preview of the many videos

00:45:15.719 --> 00:45:18.320
we will enjoy at this convention?

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.460
We thought so, let's watch.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.460
I tried to look for work, but I was unsuccessful.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.760
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.360
And the specialist gave us the diagnosis

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.760
of a very aggressive rain tumor.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.760
My negative disposition made me a very impatient,

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.559
sarcastic and demanding person.

00:45:42.559 --> 00:45:45.059
The fact that I was not appointed as an elder

00:45:45.059 --> 00:45:47.260
made me feel disappointed.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.860
Jehovah will act in the near future,

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.559
fulfilling all his promises.

00:45:52.559 --> 00:45:54.860
And so I'm happy to endure.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.460
And when everything around you is chaotic,

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:04.260
the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.559
Regaining joy is a work in progress.

00:46:08.559 --> 00:46:13.059
I've always admired the beauty and power of the sea.

00:46:13.059 --> 00:46:16.460
It reminds me that the one who created the sea,

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.059
it's not hard for him to care for

00:46:19.059 --> 00:46:26.139
just one small human like me.

00:46:26.139 --> 00:46:27.940
What a wonderful preview.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.039
We have so many blessings to appreciate

00:46:31.039 --> 00:46:33.340
and to draw strength from.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:38.840
Yes, enjoy the blessings of cultivating joy of Holy Spirit.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.840
From this opening discussion,

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.239
it's clear that Godly joy does not come from random events

00:46:45.239 --> 00:46:47.539
nor does it come from this world.

00:46:47.539 --> 00:46:50.639
Rather, Godly joy, true joy,

00:46:50.639 --> 00:46:55.340
is an aspect of the fruitage of God's Holy Spirit.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.039
What will be one of the many blessings

00:46:57.039 --> 00:47:00.940
that we will experience if we continue to rejoice?

00:47:01.039 --> 00:47:04.139
The answer, which this convention will highlight,

00:47:04.139 --> 00:47:08.440
is found at 2 Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 11.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.239
Please read it along with me,

00:47:10.239 --> 00:47:14.940
2 Corinthians 13 and verse 11.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.139
It says,

00:47:16.139 --> 00:47:17.639
Finally, brothers,

00:47:17.639 --> 00:47:19.739
continue to rejoice,

00:47:19.739 --> 00:47:21.139
to be readjusted,

00:47:21.139 --> 00:47:22.639
to be comforted,

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:24.440
to think in agreement,

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.639
to live peaceably,

00:47:26.639 --> 00:47:30.840
and the God of love and of peace will be with you.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:35.340
So, if you continue to rejoice in serving Jehovah,

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.039
what is the promise?

00:47:37.039 --> 00:47:42.440
The promise is that the God of love and of peace will be with you.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.239
With that in mind,

00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:47.739
let's be determined to always rejoice.

00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:49.340
In turn, Jehovah,

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:54.940
the happy God will always be with us.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.340
Thank you, brother cook,

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:01.219
for giving us a preview of the convention program.

00:48:01.219 --> 00:48:04.619
We certainly want to keep listening to this entire program,

00:48:04.619 --> 00:48:09.769
so as not to miss any of what has been prepared.

00:48:09.769 --> 00:48:13.070
People everywhere search for joy,

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:15.369
but many fail to find it.

00:48:15.369 --> 00:48:16.769
Why?

00:48:16.769 --> 00:48:19.969
How can true joy be found?

00:48:19.969 --> 00:48:24.269
Please give attention to the first symposium of this convention.

00:48:24.269 --> 00:48:25.670
Brother Leonard Myers,

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:28.570
a helper to the writing committee of the governing body,

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.369
will begin with the talk,

00:48:30.369 --> 00:48:32.969
what contributes to joy?

00:48:32.969 --> 00:48:34.969
A simple life.

00:48:34.969 --> 00:48:44.889
Each speaker will then introduce the one to follow.

00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:47.190
The opening song of our convention program

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:50.690
reminded us that our reasons for joy are abundant,

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:53.289
and that true joy is well-founded

00:48:53.289 --> 00:48:57.190
with roots reaching deep in God's word.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:01.489
Just as a tree anchors itself in the earth's nourishing soil,

00:49:01.489 --> 00:49:05.489
so true joy is anchored in the sangs of Jehovah.

00:49:05.489 --> 00:49:09.489
And those sangs promise us joy that will last forever.

00:49:10.289 --> 00:49:15.590
But isn't it also true that Satan's world promises to give us joy?

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:18.889
Yet any measure of joy derive from things in Satan's world,

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:21.789
such as pursuing wealth, wrongdoing,

00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:23.289
extreme views of work,

00:49:23.289 --> 00:49:25.389
or friendships in the world,

00:49:25.389 --> 00:49:29.489
is a false joy that is short-lived.

00:49:29.489 --> 00:49:32.489
Think back to our illustration of the tree.

00:49:32.489 --> 00:49:37.090
Can a tree survive if its roots have been poisoned with chemicals?

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:38.690
Of course not.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.789
Well, how long will we experience joy

00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:44.690
if we seek it in this poisonous world of Satan?

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.989
Not long at all.

00:49:46.989 --> 00:49:50.989
This symposium will contrast what the world teaches about joy

00:49:50.989 --> 00:49:53.489
with what God's word teaches.

00:49:53.489 --> 00:49:57.289
As you listen and watch, consider these questions.

00:49:57.289 --> 00:50:01.690
Why do the world's ways of finding joy not work?

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:06.889
And am I pursuing what truly contributes to joy?

00:50:06.889 --> 00:50:10.289
In this talk, we'll discuss how pursuing a simple life

00:50:10.289 --> 00:50:14.150
contributes to joy.

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:17.150
The world teaches that pursuing wealth and having money

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:18.750
will make you happy.

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:22.349
And an illustration of Jesus at Luke 12 highlights that point.

00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:24.050
Please turn there with me.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:26.449
Luke 12.

00:50:26.449 --> 00:50:29.750
In the illustration, the land of a rich man produced well.

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:32.949
He planned on building bigger storehouses.

00:50:32.949 --> 00:50:37.550
And notice Luke 12 verse 19 with the man said himself.

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:41.849
You have many good things stored up for many years.

00:50:41.849 --> 00:50:46.949
Take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.

00:50:46.949 --> 00:50:50.650
So the man thought that because of having many good things,

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:54.250
he could enjoy them for many years.

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:58.150
But notice what God told him according to verse 20.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:02.650
Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your life from you.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:06.550
Who then is to have the things you stored up?

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:12.650
So in reality, the man's joy from pursuing wealth was short-lived.

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:17.050
To further illustrate this point, as you watch the following dramatization,

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:20.650
consider how a brother responds to an offer of more money

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:41.599
and how it affects his joy.

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:42.599
You wanted to see me?

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:47.219
Yeah, come on in and go ahead and close the door, please.

00:51:47.219 --> 00:51:48.019
Thanks for coming up.

00:51:48.019 --> 00:51:49.219
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:49.219 --> 00:51:53.219
And Ben, all of your projects have come in on schedule and under budget.

00:51:53.219 --> 00:51:57.119
We're really impressed and we want to move you up to the management team.

00:51:57.119 --> 00:52:00.320
Now, you had up the whole division to start.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:05.119
Management team, I like the sound of that.

00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:08.820
Not to mention the pay raise and the bonuses.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:13.820
It did sound like a lot more work, but Victor was so positive.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.820
There may be a little overtime here and there, but I wouldn't worry about it.

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:19.519
Not with your skill.

00:52:19.519 --> 00:52:23.119
He told me I could think about it before deciding.

00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:28.860
But come on, this was a no-brainer.

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.059
The new position was great.

00:52:31.059 --> 00:52:32.559
And the money?

00:52:32.559 --> 00:52:37.860
Well, that wasn't too bad either.

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:43.929
It was exciting to work directly with clients.

00:52:43.929 --> 00:52:53.409
But the hours were crazy.

00:52:53.409 --> 00:52:55.610
Our seldom the same.

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:59.610
We see an example of this in this week's Bible reading.

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:03.010
True worship, the right thing, was not easy.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.510
But required hard work.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:10.480
King Hezekiah demonstrated his zeal for sure.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:15.380
So a question for the audience is, how could we explain this to someone?

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:21.159
Able, please.

00:53:21.159 --> 00:53:33.849
Most nights, I was wiped out.

00:53:33.849 --> 00:53:53.949
And I have to admit, even when I wasn't working, I was working.

00:53:53.949 --> 00:53:59.750
As highlighted in the video, why will pursuing money not make us happy?

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:02.750
Because we wouldn't be following Jehovah's advice.

00:54:02.849 --> 00:54:06.449
And that would cause us to fall into a snare or trap,

00:54:06.449 --> 00:54:09.949
as mentioned at 1 Timothy 6 verse 9.

00:54:09.949 --> 00:54:14.650
Without our even realizing it, that snare can consume our time.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:18.949
Time that we need to be spending on spiritual things.

00:54:18.949 --> 00:54:21.750
How was that shown in the video?

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:24.849
Well, the pay raise, bonuses, new car, and other things

00:54:24.849 --> 00:54:28.250
may have made our brother happy for a short time.

00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:33.250
However, did you notice how pursuing money was a snare for him?

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:36.949
Most nights, he was exhausted from working long hours.

00:54:36.949 --> 00:54:40.949
He arrived late to the meeting and fell asleep.

00:54:40.949 --> 00:54:44.750
And did you notice what happened to his participation in the field ministry,

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:47.849
the most important work on earth?

00:54:47.849 --> 00:54:49.449
It suffered, didn't it?

00:54:49.449 --> 00:54:55.349
He wasn't prepared, and he experienced interruptions from his workplace.

00:54:55.349 --> 00:55:00.750
It's true that money is useful, and we need it to buy food, shelter, and clothing.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:07.250
But trading spiritual things for wealth is always a poor investment.

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:11.849
On the other hand, a life focused on serving Jehovah is a simple life

00:55:11.849 --> 00:55:15.449
that brings deep and lasting joy.

00:55:15.449 --> 00:55:20.150
Jesus emphasized this in his words at Matthew 6.22.

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:25.650
If then your eye is focused, your whole body will be bright.

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:31.650
The basic meaning of the Greek word for focused is single or simple.

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:37.150
It can convey the idea of singleness of mind or devotion to one purpose.

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:41.150
For example, if we focus our life on material things,

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:44.150
they could take up a lot of our time and energy,

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:49.650
and we may not take time to pray, study, or preach.

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:55.050
How much better to follow Jesus' instruction and keep our life simple?

00:55:55.050 --> 00:56:01.550
By focusing on putting God's service first in our life, we'll have true joy.

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:06.250
As you watch the following dramatization, consider how our brother gains joy

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:10.179
when he makes a different decision.

00:56:10.179 --> 00:56:13.780
We're really impressed, and we want to move you up to the management team.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:16.980
Now, you'll head up the whole division to start.

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:30.210
Victor's offer really took me by surprise, and wow, the perks were tempting.

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:33.710
But I knew there was a lot at stake.

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:42.820
So I told him I talked to Lisa and get back to him tomorrow.

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:51.980
What was this job going to mean for our spiritual goals?

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:58.809
Would we still be able to keep our life simple?

00:56:58.809 --> 00:57:22.309
Were we ready to trade our time together as a family for more money?

00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:27.309
The next day, I told Victor how much I appreciated the opportunity,

00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:33.309
but felt that it just wasn't the right fit for our family.

00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:36.309
Money was tight, but we were okay.

00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:43.699
We had what we needed, saying no to that promotion,

00:57:43.699 --> 00:57:54.440
meant holding off on a few upgrades.

00:57:54.440 --> 00:58:04.400
But it also meant more time for meeting preparation,

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:14.360
more time for the ministry, and more time for each other.

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:24.210
Did you notice the happiness of our brother and his family

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:27.210
when he decided to live a simple life?

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:30.210
But why does a simple life bring us happiness?

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:34.210
Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 12 highlights one reason.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.210
Let's look at that together.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:38.210
Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 12.

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:42.210
Why does a simple life bring us happiness?

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:44.210
The verse says,

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:47.210
Sweet is the sleep of the one serving,

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:49.210
whether he eats little or much,

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:55.210
but the plenty belonging to the rich one does not permit him to sleep.

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:59.210
So those who possess much may be anxious about losing their possessions

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:03.210
and thus lose sleep worrying about them.

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:07.210
In contrast, those with little materially have less to worry about

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:11.210
and they can enjoy as the verse says, sweet sleep.

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:13.210
The point,

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:16.210
when we refuse to allow material things to interfere

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:22.210
with our sacred service, we gain satisfaction, peace, and joy.

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:27.210
So if you're presented with an offer like the one given to our brother in the video,

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:29.210
what should you do?

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:32.210
First, pray.

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:36.210
Pray for help to make a decision that will be pleasing to Jehovah.

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:40.210
Then ask yourself, will this decision complicate my life?

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:45.210
And how will this affect the time I spend serving Jehovah?

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:51.210
Questions like those helped our brother in the video to make a decision that brought great joy.

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:57.210
Remember, any decision you make that promotes a simple life focused on serving Jehovah

00:59:57.210 --> 01:00:00.210
will lead to joy that is well-founded,

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:04.210
with roots reaching deep in God's Word.

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:11.210
May all of us attain the true joy that comes from living a simple life.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.210
But a simple life is not the only thing that leads to joy.

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:18.210
Listen as Brother Robert Saranko, a helper to the writing committee,

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:21.210
now considers the next talk of this symposium.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:31.610
What contributes to joy? A clean conscience.

01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:36.610
What would you do if you were tempted or pressured to commit some sort of wrongdoing?

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:41.610
There are many people in the world who would give in to the temptation or the pressure,

01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:44.610
especially if they felt that they could benefit in some way,

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:47.610
and they thought no one would find out about it.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:52.610
But would doing that really contribute to a person's joy?

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:56.610
In the previous talk, we saw a dramatization of a brother named Ben.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:01:01.610
At first, he chose to accept a promotion at work that put him under great stress.

01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:05.610
Let's take another look at him in that position,

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:11.610
and see how he handles things when his boss pressures him to be dishonest.

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:24.190
Hey Ben, looks like you forgot to sign off from the job order.

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:29.190
Actually, these failed that quality inspection, remember?

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:32.190
Yeah, but I like two chances of a point.

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.190
Yeah, I already talked Steve about replacing the components,

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:37.190
and we're going to get that order adjusted,

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:39.190
and I'll have a new one for you on your desk tomorrow afternoon.

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:47.440
Ben, there's no time for that.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.440
This is a huge account.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.440
If you don't sign off on this, you'd be hurting the whole company.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.719
What?

01:01:56.719 --> 01:01:58.719
Victor, I'm...

01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:06.719
I'm not sure that I'm really comfortable bypassing the inspection when...

01:02:06.719 --> 01:02:09.719
Ben, I might ask you to tell some big lie.

01:02:09.719 --> 01:02:12.719
This is a technicality.

01:02:13.719 --> 01:02:24.000
Remember, a good quarter means good bonuses for everyone, including you.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I didn't want to do it.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
But the last thing that Lisa and I needed was for me to lose my job.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:44.409
I really didn't have a choice.

01:02:44.409 --> 01:02:48.650
They can't believe you.

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:51.650
I kept telling myself that it was no big deal.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:53.650
All lies are bad.

01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:55.650
Even little ones.

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:59.650
One lie leads to another, and they cause much harm.

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:11.550
It's simple, right?

01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:19.030
Jehovah's people always tell the truth.

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:21.030
Did you hear what Ben said?

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:25.030
I kept telling myself that it was no big deal.

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:30.030
But if that were really true, then why was he so uncomfortable about what he had done?

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:34.030
It is because wrongdoing does not lead to true joy.

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:37.030
Ben's conscience was not clean.

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:42.030
It was telling him Jehovah's people always tell the truth.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:45.030
And what is the conscience?

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:48.030
A young boy was asked that question, and he said,

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:51.030
When you're good, you don't even know you have it.

01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:54.030
But when you're bad, it hurts.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:59.030
Another child said that in her head there was a green light and a red light,

01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:02.030
and that when she was told to do something that she knew was wrong,

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:05.030
the red light would flash.

01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:08.030
Well, they both had the right idea.

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:15.030
Our conscience is our inner sense of right and wrong that Jehovah instilled in us.

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:20.030
And the Bible says it is like a law written in the human heart.

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:28.030
Speaking of people in general, look at what Romans 2.15 says as it explains the function of the conscience.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:32.030
That's Romans 2.15.

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:38.030
They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts,

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:41.030
while their conscience is bearing witness with them,

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:48.030
and by their own thoughts they are being accused or even excused.

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:54.030
Jehovah gave us a conscience so that we can evaluate any situation that arises in life,

01:04:54.030 --> 01:05:00.030
make a right choice, and then judge ourselves afterward on the choice we made.

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:06.030
If we allow ourselves to do what we know is wrong, our conscience will surely strike us.

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:12.030
Then if we repeatedly ignore our conscience, it will malfunction and become insensitive,

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:18.030
and it will not recognize dangers that could damage our relationship with Jehovah.

01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:22.030
The first time a person does something he knows he should not do,

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:25.030
his conscience may prick him and he may feel guilty.

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:30.030
But if he does it again and again, his conscience will gradually fail to respond,

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:34.030
and he may get involved in even more serious wrongdoing,

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:38.030
seemingly small compromises often lead to larger ones,

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:44.030
and larger compromises further distance people from the happy God.

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:48.030
And that leads to feelings of worthlessness and heartache,

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:54.030
whereas a clean conscience that results from obeying Jehovah brings us self-respect,

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:58.030
personal dignity, and real joy.

01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:03.030
Now, how can we safeguard our conscience so that it is always clean?

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:08.030
By studying Bible principles and meditating on how to apply them,

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:11.030
so that when we are faced with important decisions,

01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:16.030
we will know how to respond in a way that will contribute to our joy.

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:23.030
We have to sensitize our conscience by learning and loving Jehovah's view of what is right

01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:28.030
and what is wrong, and being convinced that living in harmony with his standards

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:30.030
is the best way of life.

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:33.030
And that is how the Psalmist David felt.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:40.030
If you'd like to turn to Psalm 19 verse 8, Psalm 19 verse 8, he wrote,

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:45.030
The orders from Jehovah are righteous, causing the heart to rejoice.

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:52.030
The commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine.

01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:59.030
So maintaining a clean conscience in all areas of our daily life will bring us joy in our use of alcohol,

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:06.030
in business dealings, with entertainment choices, and in our dealings with the opposite sex.

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:12.030
And when we have a clean conscience as Jehovah's people, we are not ashamed to give a witness to others.

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:16.030
As the Apostle Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 1-12,

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:21.030
we can boast that our conscience bears witness that we have conducted ourselves in the world

01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:26.030
with holiness and godly sincerity.

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:32.030
At times, it takes real courage to be honest and to face whatever consequences may come our way.

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:39.030
As you watch the following dramatization, see how Ben benefits from being honest.

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:45.059
Hey, hobby.

01:07:45.059 --> 01:07:47.059
Hey, Ben. How you doing? Good. How's the job going?

01:07:47.059 --> 01:07:51.059
Oh, machines running great. Ben, I did have a question on the specs for the hair of the job. Can we take a quick look?

01:07:51.059 --> 01:07:53.059
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:55.059 --> 01:07:56.059
You need a hand?

01:07:56.059 --> 01:07:58.059
No, I'm good.

01:07:58.059 --> 01:08:10.269
What happened, guys?

01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:12.269
We got to do something out.

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:14.269
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:23.630
Did...

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:26.630
I'm pretty sure that...

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:28.630
I would just say it stopped working.

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:31.630
Whatever you do, don't tell Victor what happened.

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:46.800
We just got this set up last month.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.800
Why would it just stop working?

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.800
It could happen.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.800
Ugh.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.800
You can actually smell the coffee.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.039
I'll talk to Victor.

01:08:59.039 --> 01:09:01.039
Don't throw yourself under the bus, man.

01:09:01.039 --> 01:09:04.039
We'll help you get this cleaned up. No one will have to know.

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:07.039
This is one of the most expensive units in the shop.

01:09:07.039 --> 01:09:09.039
You take the blame?

01:09:09.039 --> 01:09:11.039
And you just make yourself look bad.

01:09:11.039 --> 01:09:14.960
No, it's okay.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.960
It was a mistake.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.960
I'll explain it.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.960
We need to get this back online.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:51.279
In the end, I think Victor actually appreciated my honesty.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:56.930
And he wasn't the only one.

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:59.930
Mark had some questions.

01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:02.930
And we had a great discussion.

01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:12.810
This time, instead of his conscience troubling him,

01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:15.810
Ben had a real peace of mind.

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:18.810
He also gained the trust and respect of others.

01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:20.810
How can you have a clean conscience?

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:24.810
By being determined, as Hebrews 13-18 says,

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:28.810
to conduct yourselves honestly in all things,

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:32.810
whether other humans are aware of your good conduct or not.

01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:36.810
Then, you can sleep each night with the satisfaction of knowing

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.810
Jehovah is pleased with you.

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:44.810
As they say, there is no pillow so soft as a clean conscience.

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:48.810
It rewards us with peace of mind and joy.

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:53.810
Besides a clean conscience, what else brings true joy?

01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:55.810
Listen, as Brother William Mallenfant,

01:10:55.810 --> 01:10:57.810
the helper to the teaching committee,

01:10:57.810 --> 01:11:00.810
considers the next talk of the symposium.

01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:02.810
What contributes to joy?

01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:11.369
Meaningful work.

01:11:11.369 --> 01:11:14.369
Work is a gift from God.

01:11:14.369 --> 01:11:19.369
And his inspired word tells us to be balanced in our view of work.

01:11:19.369 --> 01:11:23.369
However, the world teaches extreme views of work

01:11:23.369 --> 01:11:26.369
that are contrary to God's view.

01:11:26.369 --> 01:11:31.369
Some have the view that work should be avoided at all costs,

01:11:31.369 --> 01:11:35.369
and they work hard at not working.

01:11:35.369 --> 01:11:42.369
Others have the view that the more you work, the happier you will be.

01:11:42.369 --> 01:11:45.369
As you watch the following dramatization,

01:11:45.369 --> 01:11:48.369
notice how our brother's emphasis on secular work

01:11:48.369 --> 01:11:55.529
actually robs him of joy.

01:11:55.529 --> 01:11:57.529
The company took on new clients this year,

01:11:57.529 --> 01:12:00.529
and I knew that Victor was really depending on me

01:12:00.529 --> 01:12:03.529
to keep things on schedule.

01:12:03.529 --> 01:12:06.529
I didn't want to let him down.

01:12:06.529 --> 01:12:10.529
So I stepped up and took on the overtime hours.

01:12:10.529 --> 01:12:18.439
I figured it was temporary.

01:12:18.439 --> 01:12:23.739
And I even got to take home a bigger paycheck.

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:26.739
The problem is,

01:12:26.739 --> 01:12:33.189
that's not all I took home.

01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:35.189
By the end of each week,

01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:43.680
I was burned out.

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:50.550
And the weekends?

01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:52.550
Well,

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:56.789
they weren't really any better.

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:58.789
In fact,

01:12:58.789 --> 01:13:10.810
I spent a lot of Saturdays back at the office.

01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:13.810
The project took a lot longer than I thought.

01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:17.810
That pretty much took out field service and the meetings.

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:20.810
But I knew that management would be impressed.

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:23.810
That machine is essential so I can get these parts.

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:25.810
I got the reports in right on time.

01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:27.810
Look, this is costing a lot of money.

01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:29.810
I got a first quarter that I have to meet

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:31.810
and without this,

01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:36.149
it's going to kill me.

01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:38.149
You know, we had a contract that you were supposed to...

01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:44.279
Like I said, I don't care about you.

01:13:44.279 --> 01:13:46.279
I was working harder than ever.

01:13:46.279 --> 01:13:48.279
And in the end,

01:13:48.279 --> 01:13:57.039
I'm not sure anyone even cared.

01:13:57.039 --> 01:13:59.039
We know that being industrious

01:13:59.039 --> 01:14:01.039
and working hard is good.

01:14:01.039 --> 01:14:04.039
But what did our brother and the video experience

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:07.039
when he adopted the world's extreme view of work?

01:14:07.039 --> 01:14:10.039
Did it make him happier?

01:14:10.039 --> 01:14:13.039
If we put secular work above everything else,

01:14:13.039 --> 01:14:18.039
we could lose out unneeded rest and spiritual pursuits.

01:14:18.039 --> 01:14:21.039
Our brother in the video sacrificed precious time with his family

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:24.039
and activity with the congregation

01:14:24.039 --> 01:14:29.039
because he did not have a balanced view of secular work.

01:14:29.039 --> 01:14:31.039
Read with me what Ecclesiastes,

01:14:31.039 --> 01:14:35.039
chapter 4, and verse 6 indicates

01:14:35.039 --> 01:14:39.039
about being balanced, Ecclesiastes 4.6.

01:14:39.039 --> 01:14:43.039
Better is a handful of rest

01:14:43.039 --> 01:14:46.039
than two handfuls of hard work.

01:14:46.039 --> 01:14:48.039
And notice what it adds.

01:14:48.039 --> 01:14:51.039
And chasing after the wind.

01:14:51.039 --> 01:14:56.039
Chasing after the wind is an exercise in futility.

01:14:56.039 --> 01:15:00.039
You can't catch the wind and hold on to it.

01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:04.039
A person who was a workaholic

01:15:04.039 --> 01:15:07.039
may never enjoy the fruitage of his labor

01:15:07.039 --> 01:15:11.039
if his work consumes all his time and energy.

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:16.039
His work can become as pointless as chasing after the wind.

01:15:16.039 --> 01:15:19.039
We accept to enjoy our obligation

01:15:19.039 --> 01:15:23.039
to provide for ourselves and those who depend on us.

01:15:23.039 --> 01:15:25.039
But we also need to remember

01:15:25.039 --> 01:15:29.039
that there is more to life than work.

01:15:29.039 --> 01:15:32.039
Jehovah gives us the instructions we need

01:15:32.039 --> 01:15:37.039
to have a balanced life and have a proper view of work.

01:15:37.039 --> 01:15:41.039
For example, the Bible encourages us

01:15:41.039 --> 01:15:44.039
to work hard at what we do to make a living.

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:47.039
And meaningful secular work can bring us joy

01:15:47.039 --> 01:15:50.039
and feeling of accomplishment.

01:15:50.039 --> 01:15:54.039
Whatever we do, we want to do it well.

01:15:54.039 --> 01:15:56.039
Also as Ephesians 4.28 says,

01:15:56.039 --> 01:15:59.039
doing good work allows us to have something to share

01:15:59.039 --> 01:16:02.039
with someone in need.

01:16:02.039 --> 01:16:05.039
But we are advised in Scripture

01:16:05.039 --> 01:16:09.039
to make sure of the more important things

01:16:09.039 --> 01:16:13.039
and the most important work we can do is stated clearly

01:16:13.039 --> 01:16:17.039
in 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verse 58.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:22.039
Please read with me 1 Corinthians 1558.

01:16:22.039 --> 01:16:25.039
Therefore, my beloved brothers,

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:28.039
be steadfast, immovable,

01:16:28.039 --> 01:16:33.039
always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,

01:16:33.039 --> 01:16:36.039
knowing that your labor is not in vain

01:16:36.039 --> 01:16:39.039
in connection with the Lord.

01:16:39.039 --> 01:16:45.039
Having plenty to do in the work of the Lord is good for us.

01:16:45.039 --> 01:16:49.039
And it is pleasing to Jehovah.

01:16:49.039 --> 01:16:52.039
As you watch the following dramatization,

01:16:52.039 --> 01:16:55.039
see how our brother benefits

01:16:55.039 --> 01:16:58.039
from working hard at his secular job

01:16:58.039 --> 01:17:02.039
and in spiritual pursuits.

01:17:02.039 --> 01:17:17.479
It had been a busy week.

01:17:17.479 --> 01:17:21.479
But the weekend was going to be even busier

01:17:21.479 --> 01:17:29.949
and better.

01:17:29.949 --> 01:17:37.789
But first, I needed to make an important stop.

01:17:42.279 --> 01:17:45.279
Hey John, how are you feeling?

01:17:45.279 --> 01:17:48.279
Ben, how are you doing?

01:17:48.279 --> 01:17:50.279
Good, good.

01:17:50.279 --> 01:17:53.279
This illness had been so hard on John and Sandy.

01:17:53.279 --> 01:17:58.520
I couldn't even imagine what they were going through.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:13.939
It was so encouraging to see John's positive attitude.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:21.560
The next day, we had a fantastic conversation in the ministry.

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:32.090
Then, Tom and I finally figured out that glitch in the AV system.

01:18:33.090 --> 01:18:35.090
Okay Tom, go ahead and hit play.

01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:36.090
It's played.

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:42.850
Okay.

01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:44.850
Everything looked and sounded great.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:55.310
We definitely were busy.

01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:58.310
But in the best way possible.

01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:01.310
Doing things that really mattered.

01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:03.310
And for people who love Jehovah.

01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:13.140
We saw a balanced and joyful man in that video.

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:16.140
Our brother worked hard at his secular job

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:21.140
because it allowed him to provide for his family's physical needs.

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:27.140
Did you notice in the video that the brother had a picture of his family at his workplace?

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:33.140
It was a nice reminder of one of the reasons why he was working hard.

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:39.140
True, it may be that you work at a job you don't particularly enjoy doing.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:44.140
Nevertheless, you work hard and give it your best

01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:48.140
because you're doing it for your family and for Jehovah.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.140
And when you do your job well,

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:58.140
the truth is that you can find pleasure in it or at least in what it provides.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:05.140
Doing the work of the Lord includes work that we do in behalf of the congregation.

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:12.140
We experience the greater happiness that comes from giving as stated at Acts 2035.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:19.140
Did our brother in the video that we just observed give of himself to the congregation?

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.140
Yes, he did.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:24.140
He took the time to visit a brother in the hospital.

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:27.140
And we know that such visits are truly appreciated.

01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:32.140
And he participated in the ministry to spread the good news of the kingdom.

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:38.140
He helped out at the kingdom hall to get the audio video set up working.

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:46.140
Like him, we make ourselves available for whatever has to be done to care for kingdom interests.

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:53.140
At the end of the day, our brother was with his family and friends probably very tired,

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.140
but it was a good tired.

01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:02.140
He was enjoying a period of relaxation and personal satisfaction.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:08.140
Yes, all of his hard work brought him genuine happiness.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:12.140
Truly, as Jehovah's servants,

01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:16.140
all of us want to be busy in the best ways possible.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:25.140
Jehovah created us to enjoy both work and leisure as stated at Ecclesiastes 313.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:33.140
That everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:37.140
It is the gift of God.

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:46.140
Keep your life balanced and you will enjoy all of the work you do even more.

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:54.140
Please listen, as Brother James Mans, a helper to the writing committee, now considers the final talk of this symposium.

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:59.140
What contributes to joy? True friendships.

01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:11.510
Thanks to modern technology, people the world over say that they have more friends than ever.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:18.510
All they have to do is add a person's name to their list of friends on a social network.

01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:24.510
Some boast of having hundreds, even thousands of such friends.

01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:29.510
Others don't have access to the internet, so they make friends the old fashioned way.

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:35.510
At work, at school, or in the neighborhood.

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:41.510
Having good friends is very important, so we need to ask ourselves,

01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:47.510
what is true friendship? Where should I look for true friends?

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:52.510
How can my choice of friends affect my joy?

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:55.510
As you watch the following dramatization,

01:22:55.510 --> 01:23:02.510
think about the effect our brother's choice of friends has on his joy.

01:23:08.199 --> 01:23:13.199
And believe me, that's not the only dirt I have on Victor.

01:23:13.199 --> 01:23:15.199
Okay, we're listening.

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:18.199
So last week he's talking in his office, right?

01:23:18.199 --> 01:23:23.199
And he has no idea that I'm standing right there, and he's bragging to his buddy.

01:23:23.199 --> 01:23:26.199
I really didn't want to hear this.

01:23:26.199 --> 01:23:31.199
Lunch with them seemed harmless, but this was anything but a building.

01:23:31.199 --> 01:23:35.199
Hey, hey, check out these guys.

01:23:35.199 --> 01:23:39.199
It's the viable people.

01:23:39.199 --> 01:23:44.800
Uh-oh, don't look now. They have someone.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:48.800
They might try to convert us to.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.800
What is the deal with these people?

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.800
I mean, it's cool if you want to believe in fairy tales and everything,

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.800
but keep it to yourself, right?

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.800
Exactly.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.800
Those carts are everywhere.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.800
They're all over the city.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:15.359
I couldn't finish my lunch.

01:24:15.359 --> 01:24:26.569
I had never noticed how sarcastic and negative my co-workers could be.

01:24:26.569 --> 01:24:36.210
I had always thought of them as, well, as friends.

01:24:36.210 --> 01:24:51.449
But what kind of friends was I making?

01:24:51.449 --> 01:24:54.449
Did you see the brother's face at the end of the video?

01:24:54.449 --> 01:24:56.449
He didn't look very happy.

01:24:56.449 --> 01:24:57.449
Why not?

01:24:57.449 --> 01:25:00.449
The associations seemed harmless.

01:25:00.449 --> 01:25:04.449
Workmates were just taking their lunch break together.

01:25:04.449 --> 01:25:07.449
But their conversation went in a negative direction.

01:25:07.449 --> 01:25:11.449
They began talking about finding dirt on a fellow worker.

01:25:11.449 --> 01:25:14.449
Then it got personal.

01:25:14.449 --> 01:25:20.449
His co-workers started to make fun of the witnesses who were preaching using a cart.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:24.449
Please open your Bibles to Proverbs chapter 19.

01:25:24.449 --> 01:25:27.449
We're going to read three verses here.

01:25:27.449 --> 01:25:33.449
And these verses reveal the disappointing reality of looking to the world

01:25:33.449 --> 01:25:36.449
as a source of true friends.

01:25:36.449 --> 01:25:43.449
Proverbs chapter 19 will start with verse 4 and then read verses 6 and 7.

01:25:43.449 --> 01:25:50.449
Well, if the tracks many friends, but the poor man will be deserted even by his friend.

01:25:50.449 --> 01:25:56.449
Many seek the favor of a noble, and everyone is a friend of the man who gives gifts.

01:25:56.449 --> 01:25:59.449
All the brothers of a poor man hate him.

01:25:59.449 --> 01:26:03.449
How much more he is shunned by his friends.

01:26:03.449 --> 01:26:09.449
He pursues them with request, but no one responds.

01:26:09.449 --> 01:26:14.449
Friendships in the world are often based on selfish motives.

01:26:14.449 --> 01:26:19.449
As verse 4 says, wealth attracts friends.

01:26:19.449 --> 01:26:22.449
Poverty drives them away.

01:26:22.449 --> 01:26:27.449
Such friendships can be shallow, and they can end abruptly.

01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:33.449
142-year-old woman had over a thousand friends on her social network.

01:26:33.449 --> 01:26:38.449
Yet not one of those friends responded to her plea for help.

01:26:38.449 --> 01:26:41.449
Just before she took her own life.

01:26:41.449 --> 01:26:49.449
Friendships with the world are not only disappointing, but they can also damage our relationship with Jehovah.

01:26:49.449 --> 01:26:56.449
With good reason, the footnote to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 33 warns us,

01:26:56.449 --> 01:27:01.449
bad associations corrupt good morals.

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:06.449
Cultivating friendships with people who do not serve Jehovah

01:27:06.449 --> 01:27:09.449
is like trying to mix oil with water.

01:27:09.449 --> 01:27:11.449
It just doesn't work.

01:27:11.449 --> 01:27:13.449
Why not?

01:27:13.449 --> 01:27:20.449
Because the scriptures teach that true friends can be found only among Jehovah's people.

01:27:20.449 --> 01:27:30.989
Our Christian Brotherhood is the only place where we can find friends like the one described at Proverbs chapter 18 verse 24.

01:27:30.989 --> 01:27:33.989
Please open to that scripture.

01:27:33.989 --> 01:27:39.989
And notice the distinction between a companion and a true friend.

01:27:39.989 --> 01:27:43.989
Proverbs chapter 18 verse 24 reads,

01:27:43.989 --> 01:27:52.989
there are companions ready to crush one another, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

01:27:52.989 --> 01:28:00.989
Our Christian brothers and sisters are not simply companions or acquaintances, someone we happen to know.

01:28:00.989 --> 01:28:03.989
They are loyal friends.

01:28:03.989 --> 01:28:05.989
We can rely on them.

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:07.989
Why?

01:28:07.989 --> 01:28:09.989
Is it because we're all the same age?

01:28:09.989 --> 01:28:14.989
Is it because we come from the same national, economic or social background?

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:16.989
No.

01:28:16.989 --> 01:28:29.989
Our friends in the Christian congregation stick closer than a brother because they share our faith, our values, our love for Jehovah and our hopes.

01:28:29.989 --> 01:28:32.989
They work with us side by side in the ministry.

01:28:32.989 --> 01:28:37.989
They support us when we're discouraged or when we're facing a trial.

01:28:37.989 --> 01:28:43.989
They rejoice with us when we have good times together in Jehovah's service.

01:28:43.989 --> 01:28:51.989
And the true friendships that we enjoy now in the Christian congregation are going to last forever.

01:28:51.989 --> 01:28:55.989
Do you remember the brother having lunch with his workmates?

01:28:55.989 --> 01:29:05.989
In the following dramatization, watch his face closely and notice how having true friends affected his joy.

01:29:05.989 --> 01:29:19.140
I was so glad I had taken a day off from work.

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:25.140
How long had it been since Lisa and I got to spend a whole day together in midweek service?

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:43.359
Lisa started a Bible study and we got to share our day with good friends.

01:29:43.359 --> 01:30:03.020
People like Sam and Chloe, they've really been there for us through the ups and downs.

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:09.020
Is that you? What are you doing over there?

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:12.020
Did you guys know about this?

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:24.840
I don't know where we'd be if Jehovah hadn't helped us to keep our priorities straight.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:33.800
Keeping our life simple, having a clean conscience,

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:45.869
staying focused on work that has real meaning, and having real friends.

01:30:45.869 --> 01:30:51.319
What more can you ask for?

01:30:51.319 --> 01:31:00.489
Isn't that the way we feel after we spend time with our true friends in the congregation?

01:31:00.489 --> 01:31:08.489
What is it about our brothers and sisters that makes those friendships so special, so precious?

01:31:08.489 --> 01:31:11.489
Why do those friendships bring us so much joy?

01:31:11.489 --> 01:31:16.489
Because our friendship is based on a solid foundation.

01:31:16.489 --> 01:31:22.489
Even when we meet a fellow witness for the first time, we already know a lot about each other.

01:31:22.489 --> 01:31:25.489
Think about all the things we share in common.

01:31:25.489 --> 01:31:29.489
We worship the only true God, Jehovah.

01:31:29.489 --> 01:31:33.489
We speak the same pure language of truth.

01:31:33.489 --> 01:31:40.489
We adhere to Jehovah's high moral standards, and we have the same hope for the future.

01:31:40.489 --> 01:31:51.739
These things are the foundation of a relationship built on confidence and trust, a true friendship.

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:56.739
What a contrast to people who do not know Jehovah.

01:31:56.739 --> 01:32:02.739
Whether their friendships are formed online, at work, at school, or in the neighborhood.

01:32:02.739 --> 01:32:07.739
Friendships in the world are often based on shared interest.

01:32:07.739 --> 01:32:14.739
However, true friendships are based on common values.

01:32:14.739 --> 01:32:19.739
Please open to Proverbs 17, verse 17.

01:32:19.739 --> 01:32:27.739
And notice the kind of friendships we will enjoy when they are based on spiritual values.

01:32:27.739 --> 01:32:30.739
Proverbs 17, verse 17.

01:32:31.739 --> 01:32:40.739
A true friend shows love at all times, and is a brother who is born for times of distress.

01:32:40.739 --> 01:32:47.739
True friends support one another, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

01:32:47.739 --> 01:32:53.739
And our true friendships make a valuable contribution to our joy.

01:32:53.739 --> 01:33:04.279
People everywhere want to be happy, but many fail to find true joy because they are looking in the wrong place.

01:33:04.279 --> 01:33:14.279
As we have discussed in this symposium, the world claims that we can be happy if we pursue wealth, if we engage in sinful conduct,

01:33:14.279 --> 01:33:22.279
if we adopt extreme views of work, or if we cultivate friendships anywhere we can find them.

01:33:23.279 --> 01:33:30.279
Such assertions originate with the ruler of the world, the father of the lie, Satan the devil.

01:33:30.279 --> 01:33:37.279
If we look for happiness in Satan's world, we are going to be disappointed.

01:33:37.279 --> 01:33:48.279
In contrast, this first symposium of our always rejoiced convention has identified four factors that contribute to our lasting joy.

01:33:48.279 --> 01:34:04.279
God's word teaches us that joy comes from first living a simple life, second having a clean conscience, third doing meaningful work, and fourth having true friendships.

01:34:04.279 --> 01:34:10.279
Our loving father, Jehovah, knows what makes us truly happy.

01:34:10.279 --> 01:34:14.279
So may we continue to follow his sound advice.

01:34:14.279 --> 01:34:20.279
If we do, we will find abundant joy that lasts forever.

01:34:20.279 --> 01:34:28.750
Thank you, brothers, for highlighting how God's word guides us to a way of life that is truly joyful.

01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:41.060
We now invite all who are able to do so to stand and sing song number 89 entitled Listen, Obey, and Be Blessed.

01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:46.060
After the song, you may wish to remain standing for some announcements.

01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:49.060
Again, that song number 89.
