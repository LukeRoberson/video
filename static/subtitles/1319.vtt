00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.539
The Amazon Rainforest, a wonder of Jehovah's creation.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.539
It has the greatest level of biodiversity in a tropical forest in the world.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:53.679
Right in the heart of the state of Amazonas, Jehovah's Witnesses had an additional reason

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.679
to meditate on the creator's abilities and to be eternally thankful to him.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:04.819
On the day before the dedication of the new assembly hall,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.819
special arrangements were made to receive the various visitors

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.819
that observed all the progress of the construction project,

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:15.579
the reaction of neighbors,

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.579
public authorities, researchers, and environmentalists was not worthy.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.849
I was surprised.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:28.849
Sometimes it's hard to believe that people who are not professional construction workers

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:30.849
were able to do this.

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:32.849
According to what I was told,

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.849
the work was all done by volunteers.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.849
For me, that was impressive.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.849
When I saw in your brochures that more than 4,000 workers had been here,

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.849
voluntarily making it happen,

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.849
then the impact for me was something sensational.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:50.849
I was impressed.

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.849
This is an art.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.849
Administrating things in this way is an art.

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:57.849
I really like this place.

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.849
We were really well received when we arrived.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.849
The next day, despite the heavy rain which is common in the region,

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:07.849
there was a great deal of emotion among the almost 2,000 brothers

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:13.699
that attended the dedication program.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.699
This was an unforgettable moment,

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.699
especially for all who participated in the construction project.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:30.110
We have been waiting for a place like this.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.110
This really is a gift from Jehovah.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.110
I heard brothers here say many times.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.110
For 20 years, we have wandered in an assembly hall.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.110
We looked into so many plots of land

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.110
and had so many difficult situations.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.110
A brother even commented that when he was buying land,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.110
someone chased after him with a machete.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.110
When we arrived here in Manaus,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.110
the brothers would talk of how they experienced such things.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.110
But the brothers spoke with joy and respect about this building.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.110
They came with joy to the construction site.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.110
The events that took place here during the construction

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.110
show that Jehovah directed things.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.110
And that Jehovah is very interested in this empty light

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.110
in the middle of the forest.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.110
We give thanks to Jehovah that we were tired to become pioneers.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.110
Because we had not been tired to pioneer 10 years ago.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.110
We wouldn't have had the time that we did to dedicate to this work.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.110
It's a fact that we draw close to him.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.180
And it makes us think that, sorry,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.180
that we made the right decision.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.180
Once more, Jehovah's marvelous personality

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.180
is evident in the Amazon.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.650
His name is properly represented in the region.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.650
And now our brothers have an excellent place to worship Jehovah.
