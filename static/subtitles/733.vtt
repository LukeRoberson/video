00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:10.230
Over the past few years, we have all looked forward to what has affectionately been called the Inside Story.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.230
This time it will be conducted by another one of the Gilead Instructors, Brother Richard Chilton.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:46.090
Take it away, Brother Chilton.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.090
Welcome to this edition of the Inside Story.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:01:01.090
At Joshua chapter 24 verse 15, the tribes of Israel were instructed to choose for themselves whom they would serve.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.090
Well, our foreguess today have had to make some choices of their own.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.090
Choices that no doubt contributed to their qualifying to attend the 149th class of Gilead.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:27.090
Let's learn more about the choices they made and who helped them to do so as we meet our first guest, Brother Sanghili from South Korea.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.980
Welcome, Sanghili.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.980
Thank you.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.549
Please have a seat.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.549
Well, Sanghili, you come from a family of worshipers that have been faithfully serving Jehovah for three generations.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.549
Tell us about them.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.549
Yes, it began with my grandmother.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.549
She was the first to become a witness back in 1970.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:04.549
I'm so grateful to Jehovah that all in my family, my parents, my sister and her husband and my brothers and their wives are all serving faithfully Jehovah to this day.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.550
Well, that's certainly a wonderful heritage to be a part of.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.550
Now, your current assignment is at the branch office in Korea.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.550
How long have you been serving there?

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.550
Well, if you count the first one and a half years I served at Bethel, that would be nine and a half years.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.550
I say that because I was reassigned.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.550
I actually left Bethel to go to prison.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.550
Well, now that's not something we typically hear as a reason for leaving Bethel, is it? What happened?

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:46.550
You see, in South Korea, all males become eligible for military conscription when they turn 19, and a draft notice comes sometime after that.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:56.550
As for us Jehovah's Witnesses, because we refuse military service, the result would be a year and a half sentence in prison, but you may not go right away.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.550
Now, that's interesting. What would be the factors that would determine when your prison sentence would actually begin?

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:16.550
From the time you receive a draft notice until you actually go to prison, especially in recent times, that time period was unknown and different for each brother.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.550
A lot depended on the judge you get.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:28.550
As for me, I had to wait five years from the time I first appeared in the court until I finally went into prison.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:36.550
Well, was that frustrating for you to, in effect, have your life be placed on hold for five years?

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:45.550
Honestly, yes. But understanding that I could go into prison at any moment, I had to make a choice.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.550
Choice as to how I was going to spend my time.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:59.550
Do I use that time just staying at home, doing nothing, planning nothing since I could go into prison at any moment?

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.550
Or do I use that time to earn some money for the time when I'm finally released from prison?

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.550
Or do I use my life to the full, pursuing spiritual things first while I could do so freely?

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.550
Well, that's quite the situation to be in. What was your thought process through that?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.550
What did you decide to do given those circumstances?

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.550
So the first thing I did was pray. I prayed and prayed.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:41.550
And while doing research, I came across an article in December 1, 2004, Issue of the Watch Tower, which was entitled Trusting in Juhova's Care.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:49.550
In that article, there was a quote that said, we should plan ahead as if Armageddon would not come in our lifetime.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.550
But live our life as if it would come tomorrow.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:04.550
Well, that was the answer I needed. So I decided to plan ahead as if my prison term wasn't coming tomorrow.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:14.550
Okay, so given those options that you mentioned to us a minute ago, what did you decide to do?

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.550
So I decided to pioneer. I also volunteered at the International Convention.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:29.550
Here I'm welcoming the delegates as they arrive to their hotel. I also got even accepted to Bethel.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.550
Here I'm working in my assignment. And here are the brothers and sisters working in the computer department where I work.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.550
How nice.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:46.550
Well, let me ask you, how do you feel something that you benefited by choosing to pursue spiritual pursuits,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.550
why you were waiting for those five years?

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:57.550
Pioneering and Bethel service really helped me to prepare my heart for the time when the call finally came to go to prison.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.550
And it was during this period that I really grew spiritually.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:08.550
Well, I guess pioneering and Bethel can have that positive effect on a person, can't it?

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:15.550
But the day did finally arrive, didn't it? When you had to leave and begin your prison sentence,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.550
we can only imagine what a sobering moment that was for you. Do you mind telling us about it?

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:30.550
Yes, when the day came, many in the Bethel family, they came outside to wave me off and to cheer me on.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:37.550
It was a moment that I'll never forget. One brother, he even said, he will always remember me in his heart.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.550
And I really cherish what he said to me.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:50.550
Well, that was very encouraging, no doubt. Do you mind talking about how life was for you in prison?

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.550
There were definitely moments when I felt anxious.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:03.550
But my three fleshly brothers and many other Korean brothers, they also served their time in prison.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:10.550
And their choices and experiences helped me decide how I was going to spend my time in prison.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.550
So I decided to make a list right away, what to do while I'm in prison.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.550
I made some spiritual goals, such as reading Proclaimers book and reading other publications.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:32.550
And a group of about seven to eight brothers in the same prison cell, we discussed a daily text together every day.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:38.550
And in the evening, we called it evening worship, similar to morning worship in Bethel.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.550
Well, that was certainly wise use of the time that you had there.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:51.550
What can you tell us about the current situation in South Korea for our brothers in connection with military service?

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:59.550
Just a few months ago, the authorities adopted alternative service for proven conscientious objectors.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.550
Under this arrangement, you are not labeled as a convicted criminal.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.550
And you don't live in a prison cell, but live in a more communal living arrangement.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.550
But there is one thing about this alternative service.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:20.550
Instead of your prison sentence being a year and a half, you have to do alternative service for three years.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.550
Wow, okay, double the time.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:33.549
You know, our hearts really go out to our brothers and our sisters that have served time in prison for righteousness sake.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:39.549
You are able to complete your prison sentence. What was next for you once you were a free man?

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:45.549
Without hesitation, I immediately filled out another application to return to Bethel.

00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:49.549
And I was accepted to return to Bethel.

00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:52.549
Well, good for you. We're glad that worked out.

00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:56.549
If we could just circle back for just one moment.

00:08:57.549 --> 00:09:07.549
You had mentioned that there was one thing in particular that was especially helpful to you that helped you endure that difficult time in prison.

00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:10.549
Do you mind telling us about it?

00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:19.549
Of course, many brothers and sisters around the world, they wrote to us brothers in prison.

00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:22.549
And I personally received a number of them.

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:44.610
In fact, I brought them some of them here right here with me that someone who never met me, who never knew me wrote such an encouraging comforting letters.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.610
It really warned my hearts and really comforted me.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:54.610
It made me feel that I'm never alone where I am wherever I am in the world.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:10:00.610
And that I was part of a very special, close, loving, international brotherhood.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:07.610
So I read them over and over again, and I saved all of these letters.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:16.610
That is so encouraging, Sung Hee. But I have to ask you, why did you bring these letters with you to New York?

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:23.610
Actually, some of these letters came from satellites right here at World Headquarters.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:34.610
I wanted to meet them in person and tell them how much I appreciated all those letters and prayers and how they really helped me to get through my time in prison.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:41.610
Well, we could certainly understand if those would have been some terrible reunions for you.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:46.610
Well, in conclusion, Sung Hee, I'll just have one last question for you.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:56.610
You had mentioned earlier when you were deciding what you were going to do with the time you had before going to prison, you said the first thing that you did was pray.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.610
Why was prayer so important to you?

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:11.610
Through these experiences, I'm absolutely confident that Jehovah both hears and answers our prayers when we are faced with choices.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:24.610
And also, I am confident that by means of the prayers that were offered in my behalf, Jehovah helped me to stick to the choices that I had made to stay loyal to him.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:33.610
So please keep praying for our brothers in prison wherever they are in the world, and please keep writing them letters.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:38.610
Well, I can assure you, Sung Hee, he will continue to do just that.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:46.080
Thank you so much for sharing your encouraging experience with us. It really touched our hearts.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:56.080
Well, next on our program, we're going to go all the way to West Africa, and our next guest will be coming from the country of Senegal.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.080
We'll meet Alin and Akai Tindang.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.490
Well, Alin and Akai, welcome. Nice to have you with us on the inside story.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.490
Thank you.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.490
Thank you.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.490
It's a pleasure to have you.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:20.490
Now, I understand that your current assignment has you serving at the branch office in Senegal, West Africa.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.490
Now, Alin, Senegal is your home, born and raised.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:31.490
But Akai, I understand that you come from the neighboring country of Mali.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:40.490
In fact, I was told that your mother comes from a very interesting part of the country of Mali. Can you tell us about it?

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.490
Yes, my mother is from Timbuktu.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.490
In fact, when I was young, she took me there to visit her family.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:58.490
Now, Akai, you are probably the first person that we have ever met that has actually been to Timbuktu. What is it like?

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:09.490
Well, as you can see on the screen, that is how the region of Timbuktu looks like. It is in the Sahara Desert, which stretches on thousands of kilometers.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:17.490
Well, it's obviously a very vast territory, but what can you tell us about the people of the Timbuktu region?

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:28.490
The people there live a nomadic lifestyle and are nearly all Muslims. Actually, both my two parents are from a Muslim background.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:37.490
Now, that's quite interesting. Given that background, what were some of the challenges that you had to face in becoming one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:50.490
Although I get baptized in 15 years of age, I didn't always made the best choices in my 10 years, and I had to suffer the consequences of those choices.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:14:05.490
However, in my early 20s, I decided to build a strong and personal relationship with Jehovah. To be able to do so, I received help from spiritually mature brothers and sisters.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:25.490
Such as pioneers, elders, missionaries. For example, this is my spiritual mother on the left side of the screen, and on the right side of the screen, her missionary companion, who is still serving in Mali faithfully for 45 years now.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:35.490
All this mature person helped me to see the value of personal study and thinking ability.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:49.490
Once I get this good habit of reasoning on Bible principles, I can now make good choices that pleases Jehovah, such as living my well-paying job and start pioneering.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:15:05.490
It was not easy, however, because there was still this family pressure for me to get a good job and a good living, but I'm still striving to try to make good decisions that pleases Jehovah.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:18.490
Well, that's encouraging in spite of the pressures that you had to face. You obviously continued making good decisions because you were eventually appointed to serve as a special pioneer, weren't you?

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:24.490
In the southern part of Mali in a region called Sikaso, tell us about that please.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:36.490
Yes, I was so happy there. The preaching work was wonderful. I really enjoyed it. And this is the Kingdom Hall where I served in.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:43.490
And one day, we received a visit from a circuit over here, a single circuit over here.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:16:00.490
Okay, now that I could see when you made that comment, you looked over at a lens. So we can only assume that a lens, you were this young, handsome, single circuit over here that visited a guy's congregation in Sikaso, is that right?

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:14.490
Well, I visit the congregation, but we had already met previously in a circuit assembly, so we knew each other, but at the time there was nothing special going on.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:25.490
Okay, well, thank you for the clarification. We appreciate that. But since we're now talking to you, Alan, maybe we could hear a little bit about your story.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.490
Did you always want to be a circuit over here?

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:35.490
Well, no. In fact, when I were a boy, I wanted to become a Catholic priest.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.490
Oh, really?

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:49.490
Yes. Being raised in a Catholic family, at 13, I went to get training by one of the Catholic religious order.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:56.899
But after just the one year of training, I chose to live.

00:16:56.899 --> 00:17:08.900
Although I left, I still had a love for the Bible. One day, I went to one of my friends to see if he would like to play soccer with me.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:14.900
But he was about to have a Bible study with one of the hovers witnesses who were a missionary.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.900
So I decided to stay and listen.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:26.900
Over the time, I came to love really what I was studying in the Bible.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:34.900
And eventually, I got baptized at the age of 17, as shown here.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:42.900
Wow. Now, that's quite interesting. You had mentioned to me before that your parents are not Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.900
How did they respond to your becoming baptized as one?

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:58.900
Well, it was not easy for them to accept. They had expectation of me helping support the family financial.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:06.900
In the same time, I wanted really to pioneer. So it took several years, much struggling.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:12.900
But eventually, I was able to enter in pioneer service.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:22.900
Was there anyone in your life at that time that helped you to stay spiritually focused as you were trying to achieve these spiritual goals?

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:38.900
Yes. Like Akai, while working toward entering in pioneer service, I too chose to associate with strong, spiritually strong one in the congregation.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:51.900
Missionaries like this couple helped me to see the importance of putting and keeping first spiritual things in life.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.900
And this helped me to remain focused.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:02.900
Eventually, I was able to serve in an assigned territory going throughout the territory with my motorbike.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.900
It was a real good time that I enjoyed there.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.900
You know, I've always wanted one of those.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.900
Yes. And later, I was invited to attend school for single brothers.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.900
And after that, I was trained in the circuit work.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:27.900
And this couple, shown here, that is the missionary couple that first started my Bible study,

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.900
is the one that provided the training for the circuit work.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:39.900
We can only imagine they must have been so proud of you to see the spiritual progress that you have made.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.900
But now, let's fast forward just a little bit in this story.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.900
At this point, now you're serving as a circuit overseer.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.900
Akai is serving as a special pioneer in Sikoso.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.900
And Akai, you've been sitting there so patiently waiting. Thank you, by the way.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.900
Would you like to continue the story?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:06.900
Yes. When we get to know better each other, we decided to get married.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.900
In fact, we were married in Senegal on one Tuesday.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:17.900
And we had to be that same letter, that same week in Guinea-Bisao for the circuit assembly.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.900
Okay, if we could just pause for just a moment here.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:28.900
So if we're understanding this, Alen, please tell us that there were no circuit overseers,

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.900
substitute circuit overseers available in all of West Africa,

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.900
that could cover that circuit assembly for you.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.900
You were married four days and had to be in another country for an assembly.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.900
There was no one that could take care of that assembly for you. Really?

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.900
Well, the shilton, that was fine.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:54.900
As you already know, the blessings of Jehovah are far beyond any sacrifices we can make in his service.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:00.900
We really love that work. We love the being with our brothers and sisters.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.900
Oh, yes. We really love preaching with them.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:09.900
You can see in this picture, preaching with them, it's really so special to us.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.900
Seeing them in this picture brings very nice memories, even.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:20.900
Yeah. We enjoyed also being with them in their homes, seeing their strong faith,

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.900
their love for Jehovah, despite the challenges they are facing,

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.900
we really come to love them very much.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.900
Well, just taking a look at your happy smiles on that picture there,

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:40.900
we could see that you not only loved the work, but you loved the people that you were serving.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.900
But as we know, changes come, don't they?

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:51.900
And you received a change of assignment from the circuit work into Bethel, in synagogue.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.900
In fact, I understand this picture was taken just two months before you came to New York

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:04.900
to begin your Gilea training with Brother Splein, providing a shepherding visit on your Bethel family.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.900
Beautiful family, by the way.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:12.900
Now, from our previous discussions, it became very clear to me,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:19.900
how much you both love and appreciate the young people that are in our organization.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:28.900
From your personal observations, what would you say were the things that you saw as key elements

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:34.900
to their achieving spiritual success, from your own observations?

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:40.900
What I have observed is that young ones who make the truth their own,

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:49.900
who keep their spiritual routines to be able to continue building spiritual personal relationship with Jehovah,

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:57.900
those who continue to be associating with spiritual mature brothers who can help them keep their focus

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:03.900
are those who are more successful in their Christian course of life.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:11.900
I really pray Jehovah that all our young ones may have the same experience,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:18.900
that they may test and see that Jehovah is good as mentioned in Psalm 34 verse 8.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:26.900
If they do, they can see that Jehovah is able to open for them doors where they think that there is no door to be opened,

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:33.900
and that will lead them to a long and satisfying life without any regrets.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:39.900
Oh, those are some beautiful comments. Thank you very much for that guy. What about you, Alev?

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:46.900
Well, looking back, I can see that Jehovah has really been kind and good to us.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:57.900
He had provided brothers and sisters, mature ones, who helped us to have the courage to put him first in our life.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:09.900
Their choices encourages us to make good choices, and Jehovah has blessed us in ways we could never foresee.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:16.900
And we are confident that he will do the same with all our brothers and sisters,

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:23.900
including young ones who courageously put Jehovah first in their life.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:29.900
Well, we thank you both so much for your encouraging comments,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:38.900
and our prayer will be that Jehovah continues to bless you both as you both keep making wise decisions in his service.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.900
Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:53.900
Well, last but certainly not least, we go all the way to the country of Ukraine to meet our next final guest on our program.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:05.710
Let's give our attention as we meet brother Anjel Kachuk.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:11.710
Welcome, Anjel. Thank you. It's a pleasure to have you with us on the inside story today.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:20.710
Now Anjel, it's often been said that a person's story takes us on a journey of a lifetime.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:28.710
Your story, however, my friend, takes us on a journey of several lifetimes, isn't that true?

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:35.710
Yes. You know my great-great-grandfather and mother was the first Jehovah's Witnesses in my family,

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.710
and here you can see them in 1940s in Ukraine.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:44.710
Well, that is definitely a wonderful heritage to be a part of.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:55.710
Would you say, Anjel, that the choices that members of your family made over the years had a direct bearing on your being here attending the 149th Class of Gilead?

00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:01.710
Definitely, yes. You know, they were serving Jehovah for many, many years.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:07.710
They had very hard but interesting life, life full of many different stories.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:14.710
For example, when my great-grandfather was exiled to Siberia because of being a Jehovah's Witness,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:22.710
and my great-grandmother would send him magazines hidden in the bottles of pork fat.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.710
You said pork fat.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.710
Okay, and that sounds pretty interesting.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:33.710
Can you tell us more about this secret pork fat recipe of your great-grandmother?

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:40.710
Okay, so my mom, she made some photos and sent it to me to explain how it was done.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:47.710
So as you can see here, first this fat was melted so that you could have a liquid fat.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:52.710
Then you need to wait so that this fat would become hard and thick.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:58.710
Then a magazine was wrapped in the linen and hold was made in the fat.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:07.710
And then this wrapped magazine was put in the hole and the more fat was put on the top to hide this magazine.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:13.710
And now it's done. Now you have both physical and spiritual food in one bottle.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.710
Well, there it is. Everything you need to survive in Siberia, right?

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:25.710
Well, let me ask you, did the guards in Siberia ever find those magazines hidden in pork fat?

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.710
Sadly, but yes.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:35.710
And that's why they added additional five and a half years for my great-grandfather exiled time in Siberia.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:40.710
But soon his son, my grandfather, was exiled to Siberia too.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:47.710
And here you can see my great-grandfather on the left and my grandfather on the right.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:51.710
When you shared with us some details about your great-grandfather,

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.710
what can you tell us about your grandfather depicted on the right?

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.710
You know, he was so zealous for Jehovah.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:05.710
While in Siberia, he was helping in supplying by the literature for local brothers and sisters,

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.710
though it was not always safe to do it.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:12.710
Well, clearly they were both courageous men.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:18.710
When were your family members allowed to leave Siberia and return to the Ukraine?

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.710
It was in 1967-68.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:31.710
And it was then when my great-grandfather started to reproduce Bible magazines and books and whole family helped.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:38.710
That's amazing. Were there any particular methods that they used to accomplish this?

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:44.710
They used several different methods. For example, they used special photo machines, like you see here,

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.710
to make photos of magazines.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:55.710
This and similar to these machines were used to make, so to say, handmade literature.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:03.710
Well, just looking at those photos, we can see that the men in your family were both courageous and zealous.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.710
Yes, they were. But so were the women in our family.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:13.710
Here, on this photo, you can see my great-grandmother with her daughter.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.710
And it was her who sent these magazines hidden in the bottles of pork fat.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:24.710
And here you can see my grand-mother on my mother's side. She was witnessed too.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.710
And here you can see her with her children.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:33.710
And this little girl with a guitar is my mom.

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:43.710
And you know, once a government wanted to separate them, they wanted to have public hearing to take all her children away.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:53.710
Why they wanted to do it? Because it was then when in Soviet Union, all children were forced to support political ideas of the government.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.710
But my grand-mother's children choose not to do it.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:03.710
That's interesting. The children made this choice. But what about your grand-mother?

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:12.710
When she's forced to make this choice between what the Communist Party was dictating and what Jehovah says, what does she do?

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:17.710
She wanted to prove and to show that she was a good mother.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:23.710
And she was a good mother because she was Jehovah's Witness, because she believed in God.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:30.710
And you know, even during this hearing, one woman stand up and screamed, don't listen to her.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:38.710
As you will become Jehovah's Witness too. But people said, no, we want to hear more. So she kept going.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:46.710
And when she finished, all people voted in her favor. And she had kept all her children with her.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:55.710
And here you can see my grand-mother years later with her family, children, and grandchildren.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:04.710
That is an absolutely incredible story. Obviously, Jehovah blessed her for her loyal efforts there.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:14.710
But now, Angel, as you reflect upon the decisions that members of your family have made, how have their decisions affected you?

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:24.710
You know, they helped me to love Jehovah with all my heart and to put him always first in my life.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.710
Can you provide us an example of that?

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:38.710
Yes. For example, in Ukraine, all young men are required to do military service. But I, like many other brothers, choose not to do it.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:48.710
I choose civilian or alternative service instead. So I was still living at home, but government gives you any work they want.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.710
And you need to do it for two years.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:56.710
If you don't mind my asking, what job did they give you?

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:02.710
So, okay, they sent me to clean sewer and water system.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:09.710
So I need to go inside these tanks, which were so filthy, and I need to clean them out.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:17.710
And for me, it was really, very hard work. And sometimes I felt very sad about my situation.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:27.710
Yeah, we're so sorry, Angel, that you had to go through that. But we certainly appreciate your loyalty to Jehovah at the same time.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:32.710
What helped you to get through that difficult period in your life?

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:41.710
For me, it was my family. I would think about my grandfather, grandmother, great-grandfather and mother.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:48.710
And I thought, they showed me how to do it. They showed me how to go through it.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:53.710
They showed me that with Jehovah's help, I can do it.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:59.710
Well, you have learned some very powerful lessons from your family.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:10.710
And now, here you are at Gilead. You've completed your Gilead training, and we can only imagine how proud and happy your family must be for you.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:17.710
Can you tell us what has been the highlight for you, from your Gilead training?

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:34.710
Yes, Gilead had helped me to see more, to understand more, and to feel more, to see more this wonderful history of Jehovah's people, this wonderful heritage we all have.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:48.710
To understand more, this wonderful deep Bible gems, Bible lessons for my life, and to feel more Jehovah's love and love of brothers and sisters, especially here.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:56.710
You know, my family, they had just a few magazines, a few books, and song books.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:01.710
But it was enough for them to build a strong face in Jehovah.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:14.710
So, in the new world, I want to see all of my big, big family, and I want to share with them this wonderful gems I learned here on Gilead while they were sleeping.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:21.710
And I want to say them, thank you for setting such a good example of face for me.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:28.710
Well, Angel, you have certainly touched our hearts by means of that beautiful story.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:35.710
Thank you for sharing your family legacy with all of us. We really appreciated that.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.019
Thank you.

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:48.019
Well, as we mentioned in our opening comments, when the tribes of Israel were instructed to choose for themselves, whom they would serve,

00:34:48.019 --> 00:35:01.019
their response is recorded at Joshua 24 verse 18, where they said, we too will serve Jehovah, because he is our God.

00:35:01.019 --> 00:35:04.019
A wise choice, indeed.

00:35:04.019 --> 00:35:14.019
As we've learned from the experiences shared by our four guests today, the choices that we make do matter.

00:35:14.019 --> 00:35:25.019
They matter to ourselves, to our family members, to our worldwide brotherhood, and especially to our loving God, Jehovah.

00:35:25.019 --> 00:35:32.019
We hope that you have been both encouraged and motivated by the experiences you've heard today.

00:35:32.019 --> 00:36:07.219
Until we meet again on our future edition of the Inside Story, please enjoy this brief little snapshot of Class 149.

00:36:07.219 --> 00:36:13.219
Now, disappointed, thank you, brother children, along with the students who assisted you.
