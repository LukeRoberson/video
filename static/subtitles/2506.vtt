00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.429
What happened?

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.829
Nothing

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.699
Caleb, do you know why Jehovah wants us to tell the truth?

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.019
Telling the truth is like building a bridge with your friends

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:37.969
If you lie, they can't believe you and they might not want to be your friend

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.570
But dad, what if it's not such a big lie all lies are bad even little ones

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.329
One lie leads to another and they cause much harm

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:52.810
Do you remember who told the first lie?

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.770
Right, but what about Jesus? Would he ever lie?

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.700
Who do you want to be like?

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.780
Good my son, so what happened there?

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:15.819
Thank you for telling the truth

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.739
Next time something like these happens, what should you do?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.739
I'll tell the truth, and can I tell mom I'm sorry?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.780
Good idea, let's go do that right now

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500
And then we'll pick up the broken pieces
