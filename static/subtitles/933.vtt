WEBVTT

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:29.129
On behalf of the governing body and all of those working at the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:37.130
it's my pleasure to welcome you to the 2022 Pursue Peace Convention.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:46.130
These convention segments, which constitute special editions of JW Broadcasting this month and next,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.130
have been translated into more than 500 languages.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.130
The scripture theme for this session and the next is Psalm 2911.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.130
Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:11.129
As you watch the following music video presentation, notice the peace we find by observing Jehovah's

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:17.129
creations, reading his word and sharing his message with others.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:04:30.269
Please enjoy the presentation.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:38.269
I start my day when I wake up from the sun.

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:43.269
I walk through the streets, the eyes of the sun.

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:51.060
I pray, I pray, to the passing.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.060
In prayer, we hope.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.060
I stop the rest in the rest of my watch.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:10.160
This is what I choose.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300
What I want, I'm ready.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:51.620
I finish my day when I sleep.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:06:04.550
I pretend that I don't seem to enjoy my life.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:12.430
I pray that I give Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:10:42.419
We are delighted you could join us

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:49.419
for the opening session of the Pursue Peace Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:55.419
Let's sing together song number 86 entitled We Must Be Taught.

00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:58.419
That's song number 86.

00:10:58.419 --> 00:13:03.580
What kind of peace does God give and to whom does He give it?

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:08.580
Brother Stephen Let, a member of the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.580
will answer these questions in the opening talk of our program.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.580
Please pay close attention as He develops the theme,

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.580
Jehovah is the God who gives peace.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:34.690
It is my great pleasure to warmly welcome all of you and to say,

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.690
Shalom.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.690
Why is saying that appropriate?

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.690
Well, Shalom is the Hebrew word for peace,

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.690
and it occurs over 200 times in the Bible.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.690
When His use is a greeting, just as I used it,

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.690
it means, may you have peace.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.690
So what could be a more appropriate way to greet all of you

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:03.690
at the start of this Pursue Peace Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.690
We are very pleased that you're with us,

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.690
and we assure you you will not be disappointed.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.690
To the contrary, you'll be glad you were able to devote three days to learning

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:23.690
what the Bible says about how to gain and maintain peace in all areas of your life.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:29.690
But now, let's begin by talking about the person who has drawn us all together

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:37.690
for this convention, Jehovah, and how we delight in talking about our marvelous Heavenly Father.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:42.690
Philippians 4.9 caused Jehovah the God of Peace.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:47.690
Nice true He possesses many qualities, love, justice, wisdom, power,

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.690
but He also possesses the quality of peace.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.690
If you think about it, He is at peace with Himself,

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.690
at peace with angels, at peace with faithful humans.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.690
Yes, He is the God of Peace.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.690
But here's a question, does Jehovah keep this peace to Himself?

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.690
Well, let's get the answer, Romans 15.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:17.690
Romans 15, and please, let's read verse number 33.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:24.690
May the God who gives peace be with all of you, amen.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.690
So He generously gives this peace as we'll be discussing.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:34.690
In fact, He gives every good gift, every perfect present according to James 117.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.690
And one of His finest presents is the gift of peace.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.690
But now here's another question, what kind of peace does Jehovah give?

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:49.690
Well, many equate peace with freedom from conflict and strife in one's life.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.690
But the peace Jehovah gives is a lot more than that.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:16:02.690
Peace that only Jehovah can supply brings in feelings of safety, security, well-being.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:07.690
This Jehovah-given peace is described very nicely in Philippians chapter 4.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.690
Let's go there.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.690
Philippians 4, beginning in verse 6.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:18.690
Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication,

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:24.690
along with thanksgiving, that your petitions be made known to God.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:30.690
And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.690
and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:40.690
So notice, Jehovah is saying, do not be anxious over anything.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.690
Would Jehovah tell us to do something it was impossible for us to do?

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:51.690
No, but obviously he's talking about not being overly anxious.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.690
Controlled anxiety can actually be beneficial.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.690
It can move us to show concern for others.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:03.690
It can motivate us to work enthusiastically to accomplish an assignment.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.690
But now what about excessive uncontrolled anxiety?

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:12.690
Well, I can lead to physical problems. Depression can be crippling,

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.690
debilitating, infebling.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:21.690
But now how can we avoid being overly anxious over anything?

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:26.690
The answer is given in the next words of Philippians 4, 6, and 7.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:31.690
After telling us not to be anxious, Jehovah gives the antidote.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:38.690
He basically tells us to pray, supplicate, petition him, and we will get that peace of God.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:45.690
But now what does the Scripture mean when it says that this peace of God

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.690
surpasses all understanding?

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:56.690
Well, we could say that it's so amazing, so powerful, that we limited humans cannot fully understand it.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.690
It defies logic from a human standpoint.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:04.690
Our hearts and minds may be filled with so much worry, fear, anxiety.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:10.690
We see no way out, but we beg Jehovah for the peace that he can supply.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.690
And then what happens?

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:20.690
Our minds and hearts amazingly are filled with calmness, security, tranquility.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:26.690
Lorraine, a young girl whose mother was dying of cancer, said this.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.690
I was in the room when my mother took her last breath.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.690
I asked Jehovah to give me this strength to endure and to get through this.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:42.690
Immediately I felt the peace of God.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:51.690
But now what is meant by the expression, the peace of God will guard your hearts and your mental powers.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:19:01.690
Well, the Greek word translated guard is a military term that evokes a mental picture of soldiers maintaining a day and night watch.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:14.690
In the same way, see this peace of God can act like a 24-hour guard over our hearts and mental powers, keeping them calm, secure, and tranquil.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:23.690
Now here's a question, what is the key ingredient to are being able to receive this miraculous peace of God?

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:29.690
The answer, having a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:41.690
The Apostle Paul experienced firsthand many times that having inner peace depends not on circumstances, but rather on a close personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:50.690
For example, on one occasion, because Paul and Silas boldly preached, they had their garments ripped off of them.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.690
They were beaten many blows with rods.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:58.690
They were thrown into the inner prison. Their feet were fastened in stocks.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.690
But in the middle of the night, what if Paul and Silas began to do?

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:08.690
They began to pray and sing songs of praise to Jehovah.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:13.690
In amazement, all the other prisoners were listening to them.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:22.690
So obviously, their very, very unfavorable circumstances had not robbed them of their precious peace of God.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.690
So let's learn this valuable lesson from Paul and Silas.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:37.690
Having the peace of God is not dependent on our circumstances, but it is dependent on having a close personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:45.690
Thus far, we've discussed how Jehovah is a God of peace, who gives peace, and we've talked about what kind of peace he gives.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:51.690
But now we ask to whom does Jehovah give peace?

00:20:51.690 --> 00:21:00.690
The simple answer is, Jehovah gives peace to those who draw close to him and want to follow his guidance.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:09.690
So receiving peace from Jehovah starts with living a clean life following Jehovah's righteous moral standards.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:20.690
Many people in Satan's world, as you know, believe that God will accept them as they are, that God in effect will lower his standard to accommodate them.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.690
Can you imagine such pride?

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:34.690
That would be like a pot telling its maker, the potter, how the pot must be used, and the potter must accept this whether he likes it or not.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.690
Well, we know it doesn't work that way, does it?

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.690
We have to come up to Jehovah's righteous standards.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:46.690
Now he'll help us, but we do the changing, certainly not, Jehovah.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:59.690
Interestingly, James chapter 3 verse 17 says that the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceable.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:08.690
So if we want peace from Jehovah that will result in peaceful lives, we must be pure according to Jehovah's moral standards.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:25.690
Isaiah 48-22 reads, there is no peace, says Jehovah, for the wicked, or put another way, those who wickedly set their own moral standards will receive no peace from Jehovah, and will not have peaceful lives.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.690
But we work hard to live about Jehovah's standards.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:36.690
Now, it's true, Jehovah does his part to help us, but he does expect us to do our part.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:42.690
We could say that his blessing on our effort is somewhat like multiplication.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.690
What do we mean?

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:49.690
Well, if we put forth no effort, there's nothing for Jehovah to multiply.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.690
See, what is 10 times 0?

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.690
0?

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:58.690
100 times 0. A thousand times 0. A million times 0. We still have 0.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.690
So if we don't do anything, Jehovah has nothing to multiply.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:11.690
Galatians 5-22 tells us that peace is an aspect to the fruitage of the Holy Spirit.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:16.690
So the Holy Spirit will help us cultivate and demonstrate peace.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:22.690
In fact, John 1426 describes the Holy Spirit as a helper.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:31.690
But that expression helper doesn't indicate it will miraculously do the job for us with no effort on our part.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.690
Illustrate this if we can.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.690
Imagine that you're working very hard to paint the outside of your house.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.690
And a good friend comes to help you.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:48.690
Now you're painting together. But then you decide, I'll just go back in the house, and I'll just take it easy.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.690
Well, how long will your friend keep painting?

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:58.690
If he continued painting, he's no longer a helper. He's doing the job for you.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:05.690
Luke 1113 tells us that Jehovah will give Holy Spirit to those asking him for it.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:14.690
So if we ask for Holy Spirit and then do our very best to work in harmony with that helper, we will enjoy peace with God.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:21.690
And we will enjoy and promote harmony, unity, and good relations with others.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:31.690
And what a pleasure it is to associate with those who display peace, this important aspect of the Spirit's fruitage.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:41.690
When a sleeping baby is suddenly awakened in the middle of the night by a loud noise, he becomes frightened, doesn't he?

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:52.690
And he cries out for help. But when a parent cuddles him and sues him with reassuring words, he calms down immediately.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:25:07.690
Well, David, at Psalm 55, 16 through 18, said that when he was troubled, he called out to God, and that Jehovah heard his voice and gave him peace.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:18.690
Like David, when we're in anguish, we can supplicate our Heavenly Father, and he will soothe and restore our peace.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:34.690
In fact, our loving Father is eager to do this for us. Open up to Jeremiah 29, and notice he's eager to replace our anxiety with the peace from him.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:49.690
Jeremiah 29, 11, for I will know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you, declares Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of calamity, to give you a future and a hope.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:59.690
And you will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:10.690
In that beautiful, our God is ready, willing, and able to replace our anxieties with this amazing peace that only he can give.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:23.690
Well, we've now discussed how Jehovah is the God of peace. We've discussed who he gives the peace to, to those who draw close to him, and earnestly seek peace from him.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:30.690
But now, let's examine how each of us can promote peace with others.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:42.690
In the following video, Brother Kenneth Cook of the Governing Body will explain how this convention program will help us to pursue peace.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:53.349
On behalf of the Governing Body, I can say that we really appreciate your attending this pursued peace convention.

00:26:53.349 --> 00:27:02.349
Speaking of peace, we love the serene setting here at our World Headquarters on Blue Lake in New York State.

00:27:02.349 --> 00:27:06.349
At times, the water is as smooth as a mirror.

00:27:07.349 --> 00:27:17.349
We occasionally see eagles and hawks fly by, and in the fall of the year, when the leaves change colors, the forest can look spectacular.

00:27:17.349 --> 00:27:26.349
More important than this tranquil setting, though, is the abundant peace that Jehovah has given to his organization.

00:27:26.349 --> 00:27:37.349
We can say this because of the peace and harmony that unite us, no matter what our nationality, language, race, tribe, or social background is.

00:27:37.349 --> 00:27:51.349
This is truly spectacular, especially when we consider all the turmoil in the world, and how divided people are politically, socially, and religiously.

00:27:52.349 --> 00:27:58.349
However, we cannot take our beautiful peace for granted. It's not maintained automatically.

00:27:58.349 --> 00:28:04.349
Each of us personally must pursue peace in order to have God's approval.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:09.349
Jehovah certainly wants his worshipers to enjoy lasting peace.

00:28:09.349 --> 00:28:18.349
That was true in ancient times. God told Moses to have the priests in Israel bless the people with very reassuring words.

00:28:19.349 --> 00:28:30.349
Notice these words that we find at Numbers 6 verses 24 through 26, and hear what the priests were to say to the people.

00:28:30.349 --> 00:28:44.349
May Jehovah bless you and safeguard you. May Jehovah make his face shine upon you and may he favor you. May Jehovah lift up his face toward you and grant you peace.

00:28:44.349 --> 00:28:53.349
The next verse states, and they must place my name upon the people of Israel that I may bless them.

00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:59.349
Jehovah has placed his name on us too, and he is richly blessing us.

00:28:59.349 --> 00:29:09.349
Let's consider what this convention program is going to cover, so that we'll know how we can continue to enjoy God's blessing of peace.

00:29:09.349 --> 00:29:14.349
First, we'll consider how to be at peace with God.

00:29:14.349 --> 00:29:20.349
Our greatest peace comes from having a personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:29:20.349 --> 00:29:28.349
Making him our best friend benefits us and leads to peace in every other aspect of our life.

00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:33.349
How can we reach out for a close relationship with God?

00:29:33.349 --> 00:29:43.349
We need more than a superficial knowledge of him. We need to get to know Jehovah as a person and admire his qualities and ways.

00:29:43.349 --> 00:29:48.349
Then we can love what he loves and hate what he hates.

00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:56.349
During this program, listen for details about Jehovah that will draw you ever closer to him.

00:29:56.349 --> 00:30:01.349
Second, we'll consider how to be at peace with others.

00:30:01.349 --> 00:30:05.349
Our home should be havens for peace for our families.

00:30:06.349 --> 00:30:14.349
This means more than the absence of arguing. It involves putting the interests of our family members ahead of our own.

00:30:14.349 --> 00:30:28.349
As we'll learn from this program, that includes showing love and respect to one another, working as a team, improving family communication, and worshipping Jehovah together.

00:30:28.349 --> 00:30:35.349
Third, we'll consider how to be at peace despite trials and troublesome world conditions.

00:30:35.349 --> 00:30:50.349
During this convention, we're going to tour the world to see how despite opposition, illness, economic problems, and natural disasters, our brothers really care for one another.

00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:57.349
How they receive help from Jehovah's organization and how they continue their spiritual activity.

00:30:57.349 --> 00:31:08.349
No matter what may threaten our lives or livelihood, we can be confident that Jehovah can help us get through it and retain our peace of mind and heart.

00:31:08.349 --> 00:31:14.349
Fourth, we'll consider how to enjoy peace eternally.

00:31:14.349 --> 00:31:21.349
Once God's kingdom has lifted mankind to perfection, we'll no longer have to pursue peace.

00:31:21.349 --> 00:31:31.349
As Psalm 72 verse 7 promises, the righteous will flourish and peace will abound until the moon is no more.

00:31:31.349 --> 00:31:35.349
In other words, there will be peace forever.

00:31:35.349 --> 00:31:41.349
This program will help us to anticipate future blessings from Jehovah.

00:31:41.349 --> 00:31:48.349
Can you see why pursue peace was well chosen as the theme for this year's convention?

00:31:48.349 --> 00:31:53.349
To pursue something means to chase it in order to capture it.

00:31:53.349 --> 00:32:02.349
Because of the influence of Satan, his wicked world, and our own imperfections, peace is constantly trying to elude us.

00:32:02.349 --> 00:32:07.349
Therefore, we have to chase after it to capture it in our lives.

00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:12.349
This convention program will help us do that.

00:32:12.349 --> 00:32:17.349
May the God of peace be with all of you now and forever.

00:32:17.349 --> 00:32:25.349
That's the heartfelt wish of all of us on the governing body because we love you dearly.

00:32:25.349 --> 00:32:29.349
Please enjoy the entire convention program.

00:32:29.349 --> 00:32:39.170
We warmly thank Brother Cook for highlighting some of the ways this convention program will help us

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:42.170
to pursue peace.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:51.170
But now, let's briefly preview the convention program that is coming our way that has been provided by the God of peace.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:57.170
And you may want to follow along by using your copy of the convention program.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:04.170
You'll note day one has the theme Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:15.170
The first symposium will illustrate how love for God, love for neighbor, and love for God's word lead to genuine peace.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:21.170
This year's dramatic Bible reading is based on the life of Jacob.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:31.170
And as you will see, Jacob gives us an excellent example as to how we can pursue the things making for peace.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:38.170
Thereafter, though we'll have the talk, the result of true righteousness will be peace.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:43.170
And we'll see in that talk how we can resist temptation.

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:48.170
Just as a lion devours pray and assimilates it into his body,

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:56.170
Satan tries to get us to succumb to temptations so he can devour us and assimilate us into his world.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:01.170
But during that talk, we'll learn how to reject his temptations.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:07.170
Then in the second half of day one, we'll enjoy our second convention symposium,

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:12.170
take delight in God's promises of peace.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:19.170
We will be greatly heartened by Jehovah's promises of peace found in the book of Isaiah.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:25.170
For example, one of the talks has a theme, the wolf and the lamb will feed together.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:30.170
Today, we can even imagine feeding a wolf and a lamb together.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:37.170
If we tried such, it would likely result in lamb shops for the wolf.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:48.170
But Jehovah's promise in Isaiah assures us that peace will exist between humans and animals and between animals and other animals.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:54.170
The third convention symposium has the thought-provoking theme,

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.170
follow the roadmap to family peace.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:09.170
We'll learn how despite challenges, marriagemates, parents and children can successfully follow that roadmap to family peace.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:15.170
Then we'll enjoy the talk, loyally support the Prince of Peace.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:23.170
That talk will remind us of the importance of maintaining our neutrality by not taking sides on political issues.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:27.170
To conclude day one, we'll have the intriguing talk,

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:32.170
do not be misled by imitation peace.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:35.170
It will contrast the world's so-called peace,

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:40.170
with a genuine peace that Jesus will give his followers.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:44.170
But then day two, notice the theme?

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:50.170
Be found spotless and unblemished and in peace.

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:57.170
The second day starts with a symposium designed to invigorate us for our ministry,

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:03.170
so that we can be ready to share the good news of peace.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:11.170
That will be followed by the talk, young people choose a path that leads to peace,

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:16.170
and that talk will encourage our dear young ones to pursue the full-time ministry.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:20.170
And we want to say to you, dear young ones, if you do this,

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:25.170
you will enjoy a happy life and you will have no regrets.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:33.170
Next, we will see a video that shows how our brothers around the world are continuing their spiritual activity

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:38.170
and are enjoying peace despite difficult trials.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:43.170
Again, a highlight of the day will be the baptism of new disciples of Jesus.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:52.170
In the baptism talk, the baptism candidates will be encouraged to go on walking in the way of peace.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:57.170
And why? Because this is truly the best way of life.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:02.170
Two more symposiums will use video dramatizations

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:09.170
to contrast traits of peace records with the qualities of peace makers.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:14.170
And what a stark contrast between the two, you'll see in these symposiums.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:19.170
It's kind of like the contrast between bitter and sweet.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:26.170
Part one of this year's Bible drama will remind us of ancient examples of God's people

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:31.170
who pursued peace and will definitely be able to relate to their examples

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:35.170
and relate it to our current situation in life.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:42.170
The day will conclude with showing us how to safeguard our unining bond of peace.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:47.170
We'll see how we can do so by putting the application of Bible principles

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:52.170
always ahead of following local culture and traditions.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:38:02.170
Now, day three, the theme, may the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:11.170
The opening symposium will examine seven examples of ones who sowed peace and reaped peace.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:19.170
We will examine Joseph and his brothers, the Gibbonites, Gideon, Abigail, Mothibbusheth,

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:23.170
Paul and Barnabas, and modern examples.

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:30.170
We truly hope that many accept our invitation to hear the enlightening public Bible discourse

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:35.170
entitled Friendship with God How Possible.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:39.170
Now, if we think about it, we're not born as friends of God

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:42.170
because we're born as sinful offspring of Adam.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:46.170
Actually, we think about it, we're born as enemies of God.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:52.170
Sometimes you'll hear people say of a little baby, look at that little angel.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:58.170
But more accurate would be to say, look at that little enemy of God.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:02.170
Now, of course we love that little baby, and it's not hopeless

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:09.170
because our loving creator has made reconciliation with him within the reach of everyone.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:14.170
We can become a good friend of God, and that close relationship with Jehovah

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:18.170
will become our most valuable possession.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:22.170
But then, after we enjoy part two of the Bible drama,

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:28.170
the concluding talk of this convention will fill our hearts with a joyful prospect

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:33.170
that universal peace is sure to come.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:37.170
It's guaranteed by the God who cannot lie.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:41.170
Finally, we'll join in singing a beautiful new original song,

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:48.170
and we'll close with a prayer appraise to Jehovah, the source of peace.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:56.170
So dear brothers and sisters, there's a brief synopsis of our wonderful three-day convention

00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:01.170
provided by the God of Peace that is coming our way.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:07.170
And throughout, the program will be enhanced with dozens of videos.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:11.170
And we'll see our brothers, either in real-life settings,

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:16.170
or dramatizations that we'll definitely be able to relate to.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:21.170
In fact, the following video is a little small sampling of the videos

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:25.170
you will see during this convention.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:29.480
Hey, everyone who just walked in.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.480
Olivia, today's poll was she ever.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.480
No, she would never. She's in April.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.480
She wanted to go up to the girls and smash their phones.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.480
Neutral, ain't no neutral. You're just a coward.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.480
Take a trash.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.480
Why was feeling back then was just sadness.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.480
Never really peace.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.480
Hello, everyone. Haley from Genoa Design here.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.480
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.480
In June of 2018, a huge group of armed men came to us.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:07.480
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.480
Do you have any idea what this is going to cost us?

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.480
I didn't have a choice. You went behind my back.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.480
Where's your mask?

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.480
Do you know how many people have actually gotten sick?

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.480
Zero.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:24.480
That's what always happens when you're just about to lose all your strength.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.480
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.480
I'm so grateful that we made peace.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.480
Before the world turned upside down.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:40.010
But here's an important question for all of us.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:47.010
Will we prepare our heart to receive God's peace during this convention?

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:53.010
Ezra chapter 7 verse 10 tells us that Ezra prepared his heart

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:57.010
to consult the law of Jehovah and to practice it

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.010
and to teach it to the Israelites.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.010
Now, what was it resolved?

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:08.010
Verse 11 tells us he became an expert in the study of the commandments of Jehovah.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:13.010
Well, in imitation of Ezra, how can we prepare our heart

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:18.010
for what we're going to take in at this convention?

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:22.010
Well, for one thing, very important, by prayer and meditation,

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:27.010
we can make sure that our heart is ready, receptive

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:30.010
to receive Jehovah's instruction,

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:33.010
and we can also make sure that in our heart,

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:37.010
we are determined to apply what Jehovah teaches us.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.010
But then another thing we can do,

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:44.010
we can pay close attention to the music video presentations

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:48.010
that will be shown before every session of the convention begins.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.010
Now, these presentations have been carefully crafted

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.010
to help prepare our heart for each session.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:01.010
Much time, effort and expense has been expended

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:05.010
in preparing these beautiful presentations.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.010
So please listen carefully as the sounds and scenes

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:14.010
prepare your heart to accept the spiritual instruction

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.010
that will follow.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:22.010
Yes, may each of us be determined to listen attentively

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:25.010
to what Jehovah is teaching us.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:29.010
May we be determined to imitate the Psalmist

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:33.010
who humbly stated at Psalm 85 verse 8,

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:37.010
I will listen to what the true God Jehovah says

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:41.010
for He will speak peace to His people.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:46.010
If we do, we will learn how to pursue peace with all people

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:49.010
to the praise of Jehovah, the God of peace,

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.010
who blesses His people with peace.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.010
Yes, we will be successful in pursuing peace

00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:00.010
until we no longer have to pursue it.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:01.010
Now, what do we mean?

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.010
Well, think about it.

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.010
Does Jehovah have to pursue peace?

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:08.010
Does he have to chase it in an effort to try to catch it?

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.010
No.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:13.010
Jehovah merely displays peace.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:17.010
Well, in the New World, what a wonderful time it will be.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.010
When we no longer have to pursue peace,

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:25.010
but like Jehovah, we can merely display peace.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:30.010
But right now, let's be determined to continue to pursue peace

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:34.010
and may this wonderful convention that is coming our way

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.010
help us to do so.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:43.250
Thank you, Brother Let, for helping us prepare our hearts

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.250
for the rest of the program.

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:50.250
We are ready for Jehovah to teach us how to pursue peace.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.820
How is peace related to love?

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.820
How can we show love?

00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.820
And what blessings result when we do?

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.820
The first symposium of this convention

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.820
will answer those questions.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.820
Brother Seth Hyatt, a helper to the service committee

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.820
of the governing body, will begin with the talk

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.820
how love leads to genuine peace.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.820
Love for God.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:27.079
What do you think?

00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:35.079
Is there a connection, a relationship between love and peace?

00:45:35.079 --> 00:45:43.079
And if so, what role does love play in achieving genuine peace?

00:45:43.079 --> 00:45:49.079
The Bible helps us to appreciate that love is an essential element

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:53.079
in achieving genuine peace.

00:45:53.079 --> 00:45:58.460
So we're interested in showing love.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.460
As students of the Bible, we know that humans were created

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.460
in the image of God.

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.460
And as a result, you and I have the ability to show love.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:14.699
But we also know that we live in a world that has a very distorted

00:46:14.699 --> 00:46:17.699
view and definition of love.

00:46:17.699 --> 00:46:20.699
That, combined with our own imperfection,

00:46:20.699 --> 00:46:27.699
means that if we're not careful, our view of love can become distorted.

00:46:27.699 --> 00:46:31.699
So how do we guard against that?

00:46:31.699 --> 00:46:37.699
By allowing Jehovah to teach us how to love.

00:46:37.699 --> 00:46:42.699
And when you think about it, what better teacher could we have?

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:46.699
The Bible says that God is love.

00:46:46.699 --> 00:46:52.699
That means that Jehovah, our Creator, who knows us better than we know ourselves.

00:46:52.699 --> 00:47:00.699
Who embodies, who personifies love, is willing to teach us how to love.

00:47:00.699 --> 00:47:02.699
And how does he do that?

00:47:02.699 --> 00:47:06.699
Well, by means of his word, the Bible.

00:47:06.699 --> 00:47:12.699
And by means of his own beautiful example, as we get acquainted with Jehovah,

00:47:12.699 --> 00:47:16.699
we learn what love really is.

00:47:16.699 --> 00:47:22.699
And as we put that love to work, as Jesus did,

00:47:22.699 --> 00:47:28.699
then we're in a position to enjoy genuine peace.

00:47:28.699 --> 00:47:35.699
In this symposium, we're going to explore how love for God,

00:47:35.699 --> 00:47:43.699
love of neighbor, and love for God's word, the Bible, can lead to genuine peace.

00:47:43.699 --> 00:47:47.699
First, let's talk about love for God.

00:47:47.699 --> 00:47:54.699
How important is that if we want to enjoy genuine peace?

00:47:54.699 --> 00:48:00.699
Well, Jesus provides some insight and a statement he made that's recorded in our Bibles at Matthew 22.

00:48:00.699 --> 00:48:02.699
Let's look at it.

00:48:02.699 --> 00:48:08.699
Matthew chapter 22, and we're going to read verse 37.

00:48:08.699 --> 00:48:18.699
Now, to provide some context for these words, Jesus has been asked a question by a man who is well versed in the law.

00:48:18.699 --> 00:48:23.699
What is the greatest commandment in the law?

00:48:23.699 --> 00:48:26.699
Notice how Jesus responds.

00:48:26.699 --> 00:48:29.699
He said to him,

00:48:29.699 --> 00:48:37.699
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul,

00:48:37.699 --> 00:48:40.699
and with your whole mind.

00:48:40.699 --> 00:48:45.699
This is the greatest and first commandment.

00:48:45.699 --> 00:48:50.699
You must love Jehovah your God, a command.

00:48:50.699 --> 00:48:55.300
Love for Jehovah is essential.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:05.300
It has to be the most important relationship in our life, more important than any human, more important than anything.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:09.300
We want to love Jehovah to what extent?

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:14.300
Well, Jesus says with your whole heart.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.300
Now, what does that involve?

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:27.300
The context of Jesus words helps us to understand that he was talking about a person's feelings, emotions, desires.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:31.300
So does love for God involve our emotions?

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.300
Absolutely.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:38.300
But it has to involve more than a simple affection for God.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.300
Why do we say that?

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.300
Well, what did Jesus say next?

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.300
With your whole soul.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.300
That is with your entire being.

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:57.300
We use everything we have to praise Jehovah and to prove our love for Him.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.300
But even more is involved.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:05.300
Jesus concludes by saying with your whole mind.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.300
So our intellectual faculties are involved.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:17.300
We're willing to take the time to get to know Jehovah's thinking and make it our thinking.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.300
We want to think the way Jehovah thinks.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:27.300
We want to understand his purpose and his requirements for us.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:32.579
And we want to understand his personality.

00:50:32.579 --> 00:50:36.579
Now, when we think about that kind of love,

00:50:36.579 --> 00:50:45.579
it's clear that it encompasses our thoughts, our words, and our actions.

00:50:45.579 --> 00:50:48.579
Nothing is left out.

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:56.579
And that kind of love provides a basis for a friendship with God.

00:50:56.579 --> 00:51:01.579
And that results in peace with God.

00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:04.579
So there we see the progression.

00:51:04.579 --> 00:51:14.579
Loving Jehovah with our whole heart, soul, and mind leads to peace with God.

00:51:14.579 --> 00:51:17.579
And as we enjoy peace with God,

00:51:17.579 --> 00:51:23.579
we can also enjoy inner peace and peace with those around us.

00:51:23.579 --> 00:51:26.579
Now, how does that work?

00:51:26.579 --> 00:51:30.579
Well, our love for Jehovah motivates us to imitate Him.

00:51:30.579 --> 00:51:37.579
And we cultivate the qualities that Jehovah displays.

00:51:37.579 --> 00:51:43.579
For example, patience, kindness, mildness,

00:51:43.579 --> 00:51:47.579
qualities that make us attractive to others,

00:51:47.579 --> 00:51:51.579
and qualities that promote peace with others.

00:51:51.579 --> 00:52:01.460
I'm sure you would agree that we want to be at peace with God.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.460
But sometimes our peace can be threatened.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.460
We may experience pressure.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:16.460
We may be the subject of some wrong, some injustice, some evil,

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.460
that threatens our peace.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.460
And then the question is,

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:28.460
will we handle things in a way that is pleasing to Jehovah?

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:36.460
Or will we become impatient or try to take matters into our own hands?

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:40.460
In the following dramatization, notice how a family

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:45.460
draws strength from a Bible account that highlights love

00:52:45.460 --> 00:53:14.360
and respect for Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:20.699
Thank you.

00:53:20.699 --> 00:53:22.699
Okay, Mom, I'm going to preach.

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:23.699
See you.

00:53:23.699 --> 00:53:24.699
Bye, Mom.

00:53:24.699 --> 00:53:25.699
Love you.

00:53:25.699 --> 00:53:46.579
Have a good day.

00:53:46.579 --> 00:53:47.579
She's wild.

00:53:47.579 --> 00:53:48.579
Oh, yeah.

00:53:48.579 --> 00:53:49.579
She does.

00:53:49.579 --> 00:53:52.579
Okay, I'm totally posting that.

00:53:52.579 --> 00:53:53.579
Do it.

00:53:53.579 --> 00:53:57.250
Okay, it's us.

00:53:57.250 --> 00:54:02.260
I'm just going to.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.260
Hey, everyone.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.260
Brooke here.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.260
And Amanda.

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:09.260
Guess who just walked in.

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:12.599
There's Jake.

00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:14.599
Today's poll, would she ever?

00:54:14.599 --> 00:54:16.599
No, she would never.

00:54:16.599 --> 00:54:18.599
She's an angel.

00:54:18.599 --> 00:54:20.599
I think it's all an act.

00:54:20.599 --> 00:54:22.599
You know she's wild.

00:54:22.599 --> 00:54:24.599
Oh, she saw it.

00:54:24.599 --> 00:54:28.980
I was relieved.

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.980
I don't even think she likes guys.

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.980
What if she's into girls?

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.219
Everybody is getting it.

00:54:37.219 --> 00:54:53.030
I bet she's still a virgin.

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:55.030
Hey, can I see that?

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:57.440
Yeah, of course.

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.440
Here you go.

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.440
Enjoy life forever.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.440
Now, how are you going to do that?

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.440
Well, that's a very good question, actually.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.440
I don't know.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.440
Oh, not God, you.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.440
What are you doing?

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.440
Me?

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.440
Well, I try to help others.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.440
Try?

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.440
Man, all you do is stand next to your little car

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.440
while the rest of us stand up for your rights, bro.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.440
Well, I'm actually neutral.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.440
Neutral?

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.440
Ain't no neutral.

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.440
You're just a coward.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:40.670
Take a trash.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.670
How did it go?

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:45.670
It was a tough day at the car, but I'm okay.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:56:07.769
Olivia?

00:56:07.769 --> 00:56:09.769
What's wrong?

00:56:09.769 --> 00:56:27.599
Would she ever?

00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:28.599
No, she would never.

00:56:28.599 --> 00:56:29.599
She's an angel.

00:56:29.599 --> 00:56:33.710
You know she's wild.

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:34.710
Oh, she saw us.

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:41.710
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:57.940
You know, it reminds me of a situation Paul was in.

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:12.679
I think it was Acts chapter 16, in verse 23.

00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:18.530
After they had inflicted many blows on them,

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:26.429
they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer

00:57:26.429 --> 00:57:28.429
to guard them securely.

00:57:31.019 --> 00:57:36.019
Because he got such an order, he threw them into the inner prison

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:41.010
and fastened their feet in the stocks.

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:43.010
But about the middle of the night,

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:48.010
Paul and Silas were praying and praising God with song.

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:51.010
And the prisoners were listening to them.

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:59.579
What do you think made them want to sing?

00:57:59.579 --> 00:58:01.579
They loved Jehovah.

00:58:01.579 --> 00:58:10.530
And when they focused on that, how do you think they felt?

00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:15.670
I think they felt some peace.

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:17.670
That's right.

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:28.190
How about we dig a little bit deeper?

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:31.190
Well, what did you notice?

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:35.190
Gabe and Olivia are under pressure.

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:38.190
Olivia in the classroom?

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:41.190
Gabe at the witnessing cart?

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:44.190
How will they handle the pressure?

00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:49.190
In a way that preserves their peace with Jehovah?

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:52.190
Well, it's a good question.

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:57.190
And really all of us need to reflect on that question

00:58:57.190 --> 00:59:00.190
when we're under pressure.

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:03.190
We know that Jehovah's way is the best way.

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:08.190
We're convinced that his way of ruling is the best way.

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:12.920
But when we're subjected to pressure,

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:17.920
perhaps the victim of some injustice

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.920
or even of some evil,

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:26.389
we may be inclined to take matters into our own hands.

00:59:26.389 --> 00:59:30.769
And when we do,

00:59:30.769 --> 00:59:36.019
it can jeopardize our peace.

00:59:36.019 --> 00:59:43.019
So how do we demonstrate respect for Jehovah's sovereignty?

00:59:43.019 --> 00:59:47.019
The inspired advice in Romans chapter 12 can help.

00:59:47.019 --> 00:59:52.019
Let's look together at Romans chapter 12 beginning in verse 17.

00:59:52.019 --> 00:59:59.280
Return evil for evil to no one.

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.280
So this provides the context for what follows.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.280
We may suffer some evil.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.280
Return evil for evil to no one.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.280
Take into consideration what is fine

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.280
from the viewpoint of all men.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.280
And then notice verse 18.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.280
If possible, as far as it depends on you,

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:30.940
be peaceable, be a peacemaker with all men.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:35.940
Now these words really heighten our appreciation

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.940
for Jehovah's reasonableness.

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:41.940
Why do we say that?

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:47.940
Because Jehovah doesn't ask us to do something that we can't do.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:51.940
He doesn't ask us to control others.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:59.739
No, to the extent it depends on you.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:04.739
Jehovah asks that each of us control ourselves,

01:01:04.739 --> 01:01:09.739
our response to a situation,

01:01:09.739 --> 01:01:13.739
and to be peacemakers.

01:01:13.739 --> 01:01:16.739
And then an explanation.

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:18.739
Verse 19.

01:01:18.739 --> 01:01:21.739
Do not avenge yourselves, be loved,

01:01:21.739 --> 01:01:24.739
but yield place to the wrath.

01:01:24.739 --> 01:01:26.739
Why? For it is written,

01:01:26.739 --> 01:01:28.739
vengeance is mine.

01:01:28.739 --> 01:01:33.739
I will repay, says Jehovah.

01:01:33.739 --> 01:01:38.739
So the advice is, be a peacemaker.

01:01:38.739 --> 01:01:40.739
And leave wrath to God.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:43.739
Let him determine if and when,

01:01:43.739 --> 01:01:47.739
and upon whom, vengeance will be brought.

01:01:47.739 --> 01:01:51.429
It's easy to say.

01:01:51.429 --> 01:01:55.429
But is it always easy to do?

01:01:55.429 --> 01:01:57.429
No.

01:01:57.429 --> 01:02:02.429
The example of King David can be very helpful to us.

01:02:02.429 --> 01:02:05.429
Through no fault of his own,

01:02:05.429 --> 01:02:12.429
David became the target of King Saul's murderous hatred.

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:17.429
And on several occasions Saul tried to kill David.

01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:20.429
For several years David lived as a fugitive,

01:02:20.429 --> 01:02:24.429
but there were opportunities during that time

01:02:24.429 --> 01:02:28.429
for David to harm Saul,

01:02:28.429 --> 01:02:31.429
even to kill him.

01:02:31.429 --> 01:02:34.429
He could have justified that in his mind.

01:02:34.429 --> 01:02:37.429
But do you think, had he done so,

01:02:37.429 --> 01:02:41.429
it would have threatened his peace,

01:02:41.429 --> 01:02:44.429
his peace, especially with Jehovah,

01:02:44.429 --> 01:02:48.429
we know that it would.

01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:51.429
So how did David respond?

01:02:51.429 --> 01:02:54.429
On one occasion he said to his men,

01:02:54.429 --> 01:02:58.429
it is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint

01:02:58.429 --> 01:03:01.429
that I should do such a thing to my Lord,

01:03:01.429 --> 01:03:06.219
the anointed of Jehovah.

01:03:06.219 --> 01:03:08.219
What helped David?

01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:14.219
Well, he saw a bigger picture than David and Saul, didn't he?

01:03:14.219 --> 01:03:18.219
He saw a picture with David, Saul,

01:03:18.219 --> 01:03:20.219
and Jehovah.

01:03:20.219 --> 01:03:23.219
And he knew that if Saul needed to be corrected,

01:03:23.219 --> 01:03:27.219
Jehovah would do it in his time and way.

01:03:27.219 --> 01:03:30.219
As a result, David was willing to be patient

01:03:30.219 --> 01:03:33.219
and he preserved his peace,

01:03:33.219 --> 01:03:36.219
his peace with God, his inner peace,

01:03:36.219 --> 01:03:39.219
and his peace with those around him.

01:03:39.219 --> 01:03:42.219
What a beautiful example.

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:47.219
And we can be sure that if we demonstrate our love for Jehovah,

01:03:47.219 --> 01:03:50.219
by respecting his sovereignty,

01:03:50.219 --> 01:03:52.219
waiting on him,

01:03:52.219 --> 01:03:57.219
that we will enjoy peace as well.

01:03:57.219 --> 01:04:02.219
Jehovah assures us that he will bless his people.

01:04:02.219 --> 01:04:05.219
He will bless us with peace.

01:04:05.219 --> 01:04:08.219
So let us be determined to love Jehovah

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:12.219
with our whole heart, soul, and mind,

01:04:12.219 --> 01:04:15.219
and to demonstrate our love for Jehovah

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:20.219
by patiently waiting on him and respecting his sovereignty,

01:04:20.219 --> 01:04:22.219
his way of doing things.

01:04:22.219 --> 01:04:29.219
If we do, we will enjoy the incomparable peace of God.

01:04:29.219 --> 01:04:31.219
Now, Brother Ralph Walholz,

01:04:31.219 --> 01:04:33.219
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

01:04:33.219 --> 01:04:36.219
will present the next talk of this symposium.

01:04:36.219 --> 01:04:49.840
How love leads to genuine peace, love of neighbor.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.840
For telling dominant traits that would exist in the last days,

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.840
second Timothy chapter three says that men will be lovers of themselves.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.840
Is it wrong for us to love ourselves?

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.840
No, it's normal.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.840
Even necessary to have a healthy love of oneself.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.840
After all, Jesus said,

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:15.840
you must love your neighbor as yourself.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.840
And we'll talk more about that in a minute.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.840
However, the love mentioned here is distorted and selfish.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.840
And because it prevents love of neighbor,

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.840
it becomes a barrier to peace.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.840
Some Bible scholars suggested Paul put love of self

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.840
at the top of his list,

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.840
that second Timothy chapter three verses one through five,

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.840
because all the remaining negative characteristics in the list

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.840
result from it.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.840
And those traits too are a barrier to peace.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.840
For example,

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.840
not being open to any agreement mentioned in second Timothy chapter three and verse three,

01:05:54.840 --> 01:06:01.840
often leads to anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.840
Rather than bringing peace,

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.840
such a lack of self-control stirs up strife.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:13.840
On the other hand, love of neighbor has the opposite effect.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:18.840
It leads to genuine peace.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:25.840
Please turn to Matthew chapter 22 verse 36.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:32.840
One of the Pharisees versed in the law tests Jesus.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.840
Teacher,

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.840
which is the greatest commandment in the law?

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.840
Jesus responded with the words in verse 37,

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.840
just considered at length in the preceding talk.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:51.840
You must love Jehovah your God.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.840
But then Jesus goes beyond the original question

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.840
and quotes a second commandment.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.840
Let's read verse 39.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.840
The second, like it, is this.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:08.119
You must love your neighbor as yourself.

01:07:08.119 --> 01:07:11.119
Jesus is saying that the two commandments,

01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:16.119
love of God and love of neighbor, are linked.

01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:21.119
Now, how exactly would you define neighbor?

01:07:21.119 --> 01:07:24.119
Please turn to Luke chapter 10.

01:07:24.119 --> 01:07:29.559
Notice how Jesus answered this very question,

01:07:29.559 --> 01:07:32.559
who really is my neighbor?

01:07:32.559 --> 01:07:37.559
Jesus responds clearly with his renown illustration of the neighborly Samaritan.

01:07:37.559 --> 01:07:41.559
In Jesus' day, the Jews disdained Samaritans.

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:46.559
Their attitude moved Jesus to make a powerful point.

01:07:46.559 --> 01:07:53.559
In his illustration, Jesus said that the Samaritan took extraordinary measures to help a Jewish man.

01:07:53.559 --> 01:07:56.559
The Jew had fallen victim to robbers,

01:07:56.559 --> 01:08:02.559
and his own countrymen, ignoring, leaving him half dead.

01:08:02.559 --> 01:08:06.559
What Jesus said must have stunned the audience.

01:08:06.559 --> 01:08:12.320
Luke chapter 10 verses 33 and 34 reads,

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.319
but a certain Samaritan traveling the road came upon him,

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:21.319
and it's saying him he was moved with pity.

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:27.319
So he approached him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:35.319
Then he mounted him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:41.319
Jesus then asked a penetrating question in verse 36.

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:48.319
Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor?

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:55.319
His words recorded in verse 37 are also directed to you and to me.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:59.760
Go and do the same yourself.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:05.760
Yes, our neighbors include not only our family members and our Christian brothers and sisters,

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.760
but all whom we encounter from day to day.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.760
In other words, our love extends to those who are not of our own race,

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.760
tribe, nationality, or religion.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.039
How do we show that love?

01:09:24.039 --> 01:09:29.039
Please turn with me to Romans chapter 13.

01:09:29.039 --> 01:09:32.039
Because we love our neighbor,

01:09:32.039 --> 01:09:37.039
we avoid conduct that disrupts peace.

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:44.039
Instead, we strive to apply the Inspired Council at Romans chapter 13 verses 8 through 10.

01:09:44.039 --> 01:09:50.380
Do not owe anything to anyone except to love one another.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:54.380
For whoever loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:10:01.380
For the law code, you must not commit adultery, you must not murder, you must not steal, you must not covet.

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:06.380
And whatever other commandment there is is summed up in this saying,

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:11.380
you must love your neighbor as yourself.

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:14.380
Love does not work equal to one's neighbor.

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:18.380
Therefore, love is the law's fulfillment.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:25.630
That means that our responsibility is to treat others in ways that promote peace.

01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:30.630
When others treat us unkindly, we endeavor to imitate Jesus.

01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:35.630
When he was being insulted, he did not return the insult.

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.630
When he was suffering, he didn't go threatening.

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:45.630
Imitating the Prince of Peace and the God of Peace gives us inner peace.

01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:58.170
In the following dramatization, notice how a family benefits from the Apostle Paul's example of displaying love of neighbor even when provoked.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:00.170
What are you going to do? You're just a coward.

01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:02.170
Man, all you do is stand next to your little car.

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:04.170
You don't do anything. You just stand next to your little car.

01:11:04.170 --> 01:11:06.170
I know neutral, rise to coward.

01:11:06.170 --> 01:11:09.170
Gabe, what happens today?

01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:21.779
It's just, I've been yelled at in service before, but this time I wanted to, I don't know.

01:11:21.779 --> 01:11:25.779
I wanted to go up to the girls and smash their phones.

01:11:25.779 --> 01:11:30.060
I'm so glad that you didn't.

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:43.180
Yeah, but I feel guilty because I was like, it was like so angry.

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:48.979
It's okay. Let's keep reading.

01:11:48.979 --> 01:11:56.199
We have left off in verse 26.

01:11:56.199 --> 01:12:03.199
Suddenly, a great earthquake occurred so that the foundations of the jail were shaken.

01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:10.199
We're over. All the doors were instantly open and everyone's bonds came loose.

01:12:10.199 --> 01:12:18.199
When the jailer woke up and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself,

01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:21.199
assuming that the prisoners had escaped.

01:12:21.199 --> 01:12:24.199
But Paul called out with a loud voice.

01:12:24.199 --> 01:12:27.199
Do not hurt yourself for we're all here.

01:12:27.199 --> 01:12:34.119
So he asked for lights in Washington and seized with trembling.

01:12:34.119 --> 01:12:37.119
He fell down before Paul and Silas.

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:48.960
Now, think about what the jailer had done to Paul.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.960
He could have hated him for it.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:58.659
Yeah, he could have, but I guess he saw the jailer's pain instead of just his own.

01:12:58.659 --> 01:13:05.899
Yeah, Paul loved his neighbor.

01:13:05.899 --> 01:13:08.899
He didn't hold back trying to save his life.

01:13:08.899 --> 01:13:30.529
Hey, how do you get the nerve to keep coming out here?

01:13:30.529 --> 01:13:34.260
Look, you were right.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.260
About what you said.

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:40.260
No one should stand around while other people suffer injustice.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:43.260
So do something. Fight like we do.

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:45.260
This is my way of making a difference.

01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:48.260
The only way that I know the world can really change.

01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.260
Come on, man, the Bible.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:55.260
Like I get where you're thinking, but let me show you just one scripture.

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.260
All right, one scripture.

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:01.260
So this is a verse in the Bible that convinced me of how I can make a difference.

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:05.260
It's a Matthew 24 verse 14.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.260
Here it says,

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:11.260
And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:14.260
for a witness to all the nations.

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:21.100
And then the end will come.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.100
In the dramatization,

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:27.100
Paul could have reacted in a negative way towards the jailer.

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:31.100
However, in spite of the way he had been treated,

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.100
he displayed neighborly love.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:40.100
And this had a powerful effect on the jailer and brought praise to Jehovah.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:43.100
Because we are imperfect,

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:48.100
we must work hard at cultivating love for our neighbor.

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:53.100
This is illustrated in what happened with the Apostle Peter.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:56.100
Prior to becoming a follower of Jesus,

01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:00.100
he did not have fellowship with non-Jewish people.

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.100
But after he became a Christian,

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:08.100
God taught him that division between Jews and Gentiles

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.100
was not to continue.

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:13.100
And Peter got the point.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:17.100
It acts chapter 10 verses 34 and 35.

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.100
Peter is quoted as saying,

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:24.100
Now I truly understand that God is not partial,

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.100
but in every nation the man who fears him

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:32.100
and works what is right is acceptable to him.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:37.100
Peter even stayed in the newly converted Gentiles home for days.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:43.100
And he continued the practice of eating with non-Jewish Christians.

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:49.100
However, 13 years later, while in Syrian Antioch,

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:53.100
Peter suddenly stopped associating with Gentile Christians.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.100
Why?

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.100
He feared the reaction of some Jewish Christians

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.100
who were slow to accept change.

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:04.100
This illustrates that prejudice can be deeply rooted.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.100
It takes constant effort to read ourselves of it.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:14.100
But we must learn to view others impartially as Jehovah does.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:18.100
We want to treat others as Jehovah treats them.

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:22.100
In his sermon on the Mount, Jesus said,

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.100
You heard it was said,

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:28.100
You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:32.100
However, I say to you,

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:38.100
continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you.

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:42.100
Then, as recorded in Matthew chapter 5,

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.100
and verse 45,

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.100
He explains why we want to show that type of love,

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:54.500
so that you may prove yourself sons of your father who is in the heavens

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:58.500
since he makes his son rise on both the wicked and the good

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.500
and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.500
This love, produced by Holy Spirit,

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:11.500
is markedly different from the sort of love that is common in the world.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.500
It's based on a higher principle.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:20.500
Jesus said even sinners will follow a policy of like for like.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:25.500
But if we want to prove ourselves sons of our father who is in the heavens,

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.500
we must be different.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.500
We welcome others,

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:34.500
as God and Christ have welcomed us.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:38.500
At Romans 157, the Bible says to us,

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.500
Welcome one another,

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:44.500
just as Christ also welcomed you.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:50.500
The Greek word used there conveys the idea of receiving someone kindly or hospitably,

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.500
such as into one's home or circle of friends.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:59.500
Prejudice withers as love grows.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:05.500
Remember that at one time we were all strangers or foreigners,

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.500
not close to God,

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:13.500
but Jehovah drew us to Him with cords of love.

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:16.500
Christ welcomed us.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:22.500
He opened the doors at were so that we could become part of God's family.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:28.500
Since Jesus has kindly accepted us, as imperfect as we are,

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:33.500
it should be unthinkable for us to reject anyone else.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.500
Dear brothers and sisters, divisions,

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:43.500
prejudice and hostility will doubtless increase in the world as we approach the end of this wicked system.

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:46.500
As servants of Jehovah, though,

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:53.500
we seek the wisdom from above which is impartial and promotes peace.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:59.500
We rejoice as we forge friendships with people from other lands,

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.500
accept cultural differences,

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:05.500
and possibly even learn the languages of others.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500
When we do this,

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:10.500
peace flows just like a river

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:14.500
and justice like the waves of the sea.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.500
We work what is good toward all,

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.500
but especially our brothers.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:25.500
Love of neighbor moves us to make sacrifices in behalf of others,

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:29.850
and to share the good news at every opportunity,

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:32.850
our master, Jesus,

01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:33.850
said,

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:36.850
This is my commandment

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:42.850
that you love one another just as I have loved you.

01:19:42.850 --> 01:19:46.850
What are the blessings that come from love of neighbor?

01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:51.850
Jesus answers that at John chapter 15,

01:19:51.850 --> 01:20:00.369
and we'll read verses eight through ten, beginning with verse eight.

01:20:00.369 --> 01:20:04.189
Number one,

01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:08.189
My Father is glorified in this,

01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:11.189
that you keep bearing much fruit

01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:15.189
and prove yourselves my disciples.

01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:17.189
The second blessing,

01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:19.189
verse nine,

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:22.189
Just as the Father has loved me,

01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:26.189
so I have loved you remain in my love.

01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:29.189
If you observe my commandments,

01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:32.189
you will remain in my love.

01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:35.189
Just as I have observed the commandments of the Father

01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:38.189
and remain in his love.

01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:41.789
Brother Robert Soranco,

01:20:41.789 --> 01:20:43.789
a helper to the writing committee,

01:20:43.789 --> 01:20:45.789
will now present the final talk of this symposium,

01:20:45.789 --> 01:20:48.789
how love leads to genuine peace,

01:20:48.789 --> 01:20:51.789
love forgot's word.

01:20:51.789 --> 01:21:03.409
Can you imagine a collection of some 40 million books?

01:21:03.409 --> 01:21:08.409
They would fill more than 800 miles or 1300 kilometers of bookshelves.

01:21:08.409 --> 01:21:10.409
And yet that is what you can find

01:21:10.409 --> 01:21:12.409
and what has been described as

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:15.409
the largest library in the world,

01:21:15.409 --> 01:21:20.409
the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. in the United States.

01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:24.409
Which book would you say is the most worthwhile to read

01:21:24.409 --> 01:21:26.409
among all those millions of volumes?

01:21:26.409 --> 01:21:29.409
We can let the Apostle Paul answer that question.

01:21:29.409 --> 01:21:31.409
In his second letter to Timothy,

01:21:31.409 --> 01:21:33.409
at 2 Timothy 315,

01:21:33.409 --> 01:21:35.409
he referred to the Holy writings,

01:21:35.409 --> 01:21:38.409
which are able to make us wise for salvation

01:21:38.409 --> 01:21:41.409
through faith in Christ Jesus.

01:21:41.409 --> 01:21:43.409
He was referring, of course,

01:21:43.409 --> 01:21:45.409
to God's own written word

01:21:45.409 --> 01:21:47.409
that we know as the Bible.

01:21:48.409 --> 01:21:51.409
The contents of this book can give us the wisdom that we need

01:21:51.409 --> 01:21:52.409
to gain salvation,

01:21:52.409 --> 01:21:57.409
and that makes it the most worthwhile book on earth.

01:21:57.409 --> 01:22:01.409
But how can a book have such a profound effect on a person?

01:22:01.409 --> 01:22:03.409
Well, when describing books

01:22:03.409 --> 01:22:05.409
and their authors per se,

01:22:05.409 --> 01:22:08.409
the secular writer Gilbert Hyatt once stated,

01:22:08.409 --> 01:22:11.409
books are not lumps of lifeless paper,

01:22:11.409 --> 01:22:14.409
but minds alive on the shelves.

01:22:14.409 --> 01:22:16.409
From each of them goes out its own voice,

01:22:16.409 --> 01:22:19.409
so by taking down one of these volumes and opening it,

01:22:19.409 --> 01:22:22.409
one can call on to range the voice of a man,

01:22:22.409 --> 01:22:25.409
the author, far distant in time and space,

01:22:25.409 --> 01:22:27.409
and hear him speaking to us,

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:30.409
mind to mind, heart to heart.

01:22:30.409 --> 01:22:32.409
When we take this book,

01:22:32.409 --> 01:22:34.409
the Bible down off the shelf,

01:22:34.409 --> 01:22:35.409
and open it,

01:22:35.409 --> 01:22:39.409
we are calling into range the voice of its author, Jehovah.

01:22:39.409 --> 01:22:41.409
And as he's speaking to us,

01:22:41.409 --> 01:22:44.409
mind to mind, heart to heart,

01:22:44.409 --> 01:22:46.409
indeed he is.

01:22:46.409 --> 01:22:49.409
For example, at Jeremiah 29-11,

01:22:49.409 --> 01:22:51.409
Jehovah tells us,

01:22:51.409 --> 01:22:53.409
I will know the thoughts

01:22:53.409 --> 01:22:55.409
that I am thinking toward you,

01:22:55.409 --> 01:22:57.409
thoughts of peace and not of calamity,

01:22:57.409 --> 01:23:00.409
to give you a future and a hope.

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:02.409
And at Proverbs 27-11,

01:23:02.409 --> 01:23:03.409
Jehovah tells us,

01:23:03.409 --> 01:23:06.409
be wise and make my heart rejoice,

01:23:06.409 --> 01:23:08.409
so that I can make a reply to him,

01:23:08.409 --> 01:23:10.409
who taunts me.

01:23:10.409 --> 01:23:12.409
How grateful we are,

01:23:12.409 --> 01:23:15.409
that Jehovah has given us his precious word,

01:23:15.409 --> 01:23:16.409
the Bible,

01:23:16.409 --> 01:23:19.409
that reveals his intimate thoughts and feelings,

01:23:19.409 --> 01:23:21.409
that draws us close to him,

01:23:21.409 --> 01:23:25.409
and that teaches us how to gain everlasting life.

01:23:25.409 --> 01:23:26.409
Because we love Jehovah,

01:23:26.409 --> 01:23:30.409
we also love and cherish what he tells us

01:23:30.409 --> 01:23:33.409
through the pages of his written word.

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:35.409
And that is exactly how the Psalmist felt,

01:23:35.409 --> 01:23:38.409
who wrote the 119th Psalm,

01:23:38.409 --> 01:23:40.409
please open your Bible,

01:23:40.409 --> 01:23:42.409
to Psalm 119,

01:23:42.409 --> 01:23:45.409
and find verse 161.

01:23:45.409 --> 01:23:47.409
That's Psalm 119,

01:23:47.409 --> 01:23:49.409
verse 161.

01:23:49.409 --> 01:23:51.409
In the latter part,

01:23:51.409 --> 01:23:52.409
it says,

01:23:52.409 --> 01:23:55.409
but my heart stands in awe

01:23:55.409 --> 01:23:57.409
of your words.

01:23:57.409 --> 01:24:03.409
Now see what more he wrote in verses 167 and 168.

01:24:03.409 --> 01:24:05.409
I keep your reminders,

01:24:05.409 --> 01:24:07.409
and I love them dearly.

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:10.409
I observe your orders and your reminders,

01:24:10.409 --> 01:24:15.409
for you are aware of all that I do.

01:24:15.409 --> 01:24:19.409
This Bible writer did not view God's orders and reminders

01:24:19.409 --> 01:24:23.409
as just a list of cold legalistic statutes.

01:24:23.409 --> 01:24:28.409
And we can be sure that he did not consider them to be burdensome.

01:24:28.409 --> 01:24:31.409
Instead, he knew that they formed the basis

01:24:31.409 --> 01:24:34.409
for the best life possible.

01:24:34.409 --> 01:24:38.409
And that is why he not only wanted to learn God's orders,

01:24:38.409 --> 01:24:42.409
but he also desired to observe or obey them.

01:24:42.409 --> 01:24:46.409
The Psalmists believe that God's word is the one thing

01:24:46.409 --> 01:24:48.409
we're studying,

01:24:48.409 --> 01:24:51.409
and that because of knowing God's orders and reminders,

01:24:51.409 --> 01:24:53.409
we are far wiser than people

01:24:53.409 --> 01:24:57.409
who know everything else except God's word.

01:24:57.409 --> 01:25:01.409
Now look at what more he wrote in verse 165.

01:25:01.409 --> 01:25:07.409
Abundant peace belongs to those who love your law.

01:25:07.409 --> 01:25:11.409
Nothing can make them stumble.

01:25:11.409 --> 01:25:15.409
Herein lies a major reason why we love God's word.

01:25:15.409 --> 01:25:19.409
Abiding by it leads to genuine peace.

01:25:19.409 --> 01:25:22.409
Everyone longs for peace in their life,

01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:24.409
and through the pages of the Bible,

01:25:24.409 --> 01:25:27.409
we learn how to attain it.

01:25:27.409 --> 01:25:30.409
That is why we choose to live by God's word,

01:25:30.409 --> 01:25:33.409
even in the face of the trials that arise in our life,

01:25:33.409 --> 01:25:38.409
some of which may try to steal away our peace of mind and heart.

01:25:38.409 --> 01:25:42.409
And yet, Jehovah knows what we are going through every day of our lives

01:25:42.409 --> 01:25:45.409
and stands ready to help us.

01:25:45.409 --> 01:25:48.409
If we love and obey Jehovah's word,

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:53.409
we will not be stumbled spiritually by what someone else does or says

01:25:53.409 --> 01:25:57.409
or by any other matter or situation in life.

01:25:57.409 --> 01:26:00.409
But how does love for God's word lead to such peace

01:26:00.409 --> 01:26:04.409
and keep us from stumbling?

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:06.409
We know that all scripture is inspired of God,

01:26:06.409 --> 01:26:11.409
making the Bible the most reliable guide for every aspect of life.

01:26:11.409 --> 01:26:15.409
After all, his wisdom is infinitely superior to our own.

01:26:15.409 --> 01:26:18.409
Reading the Bible enables us to look at matters

01:26:18.409 --> 01:26:21.409
from God's elevated point of view.

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:26.409
It is just as the prophet Isaiah wrote at Isaiah 55,

01:26:26.409 --> 01:26:28.409
verses 8 and 9.

01:26:28.409 --> 01:26:30.409
If you'd like to open to that, please,

01:26:30.409 --> 01:26:34.409
Isaiah 55, 8 and 9.

01:26:34.409 --> 01:26:36.850
He wrote,

01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:39.850
For my thoughts are not your thoughts.

01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:43.850
And your ways are not my ways, declares Jehovah.

01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:46.850
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,

01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:49.850
so my ways are higher than your ways,

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:53.850
and my thoughts than your thoughts.

01:26:53.850 --> 01:26:54.850
Just imagine,

01:26:54.850 --> 01:26:58.850
Jehovah's thoughts and language must be vastly superior

01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:00.850
to those of humans.

01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:04.850
When he communicates with us as he does through the pages of the Bible,

01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:07.850
he simplifies how he expresses his thoughts

01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:10.850
so that we can understand them.

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:13.850
Then, as we take in all that Jehovah says,

01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:17.850
we can let his thinking guide our thinking.

01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:21.850
Reading the Bible can be likened to peering into a mirror

01:27:21.850 --> 01:27:25.850
because its message has the power to allow us to see ourselves

01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:27.850
as we really are.

01:27:27.850 --> 01:27:30.850
And it shows us where adjustments are needed

01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:32.850
in our attitude and conduct.

01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:36.609
Thus far in this symposium,

01:27:36.609 --> 01:27:38.609
we have seen how this can actually work.

01:27:38.609 --> 01:27:41.609
We have seen two dramatizations of a widowed mother

01:27:41.609 --> 01:27:45.609
using the Bible to help her teenage children avoid being stumbled

01:27:45.609 --> 01:27:49.609
by other young people who had been harassing them.

01:27:49.609 --> 01:27:52.609
Remember, her son Gabe had been called a coward

01:27:52.609 --> 01:27:55.609
by a couple of tough-looking youths

01:27:55.609 --> 01:27:58.609
while he was engaged in public witnessing.

01:27:58.609 --> 01:28:01.609
And her daughter Olivia had been chided by other girls

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:06.609
for not being interested in dating one of the guys in her class.

01:28:06.609 --> 01:28:11.609
Their mother used what Jehovah inspired the Apostle Paul to write about

01:28:11.609 --> 01:28:16.609
with his ordeal in prison to show how he was able to preserve his peace

01:28:16.609 --> 01:28:19.609
in a very difficult situation.

01:28:19.609 --> 01:28:22.609
And that in turn helped Olivia and Gabe

01:28:22.609 --> 01:28:25.609
to safeguard their own peace.

01:28:25.609 --> 01:28:28.609
Let's see what more the mother finds in the Bible

01:28:28.609 --> 01:28:31.609
to help Olivia avoid being stumbled into the conduct

01:28:31.609 --> 01:28:35.609
that could rob her of peace.

01:28:35.609 --> 01:28:37.609
Guess who just walked in?

01:28:37.609 --> 01:28:38.609
Olivia.

01:28:38.609 --> 01:28:39.609
And there's Jake.

01:28:39.609 --> 01:28:40.609
We know she's what.

01:28:40.609 --> 01:28:42.609
I don't even know if she's got it.

01:28:42.609 --> 01:28:43.609
She's into growth.

01:28:43.609 --> 01:28:47.609
She's still very young.

01:28:47.609 --> 01:28:52.229
Olivia, what are you thinking?

01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:55.229
I don't know how they can do that.

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:58.229
I don't even follow them.

01:28:58.229 --> 01:29:04.630
If this doesn't stop, I don't know if I can...

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:09.420
You're strong.

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:11.420
Okay, you just can't let them get to you.

01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:20.880
It feels out of your control, doesn't it?

01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.100
Hey.

01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:37.100
I think we need another Bible example.

01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:40.100
Remember when we studied about the Shulamite girl?

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:46.270
Yeah, I remember.

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:52.760
And who was pressuring her?

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:53.760
Solomon.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:30:02.850
But she wasn't interested in him.

01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:06.850
Just like, I'm not interested in that boy Jake, so...

01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:09.850
But it wasn't just him.

01:30:09.850 --> 01:30:12.850
There were the daughters of Jerusalem and Solomon's court.

01:30:12.850 --> 01:30:18.310
They urged her to accept his attentions.

01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:23.329
But do you remember what she said?

01:30:23.329 --> 01:30:29.590
In song of Solomon, chapter 2.

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.590
It says, I put you under oath,

01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:33.590
O daughters of Jerusalem,

01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:35.590
by the gazelles and the doves of the fields.

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:39.590
Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me

01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:41.590
until it feels inclined.

01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:45.130
So despite all of the pressure,

01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:47.130
who was really in control?

01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:53.640
She was.

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.640
No one was going to push her into something

01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:00.970
that she didn't want to do.

01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:03.970
She even said, I am a wall.

01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:11.479
You have the same power.

01:31:11.479 --> 01:31:13.479
And if you believe that,

01:31:13.479 --> 01:31:15.479
it will change how you handle the pressure.

01:31:15.479 --> 01:31:44.460
No, give me a hug.

01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:47.460
I just posted it going like I did.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:50.460
All they want is to see me give in.

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:58.680
Why would I give them the satisfaction?

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.680
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:11.630
Nobody can make me stumble.

01:32:11.630 --> 01:32:26.850
And a wall.

01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:29.850
Olivia's mother thought of another inspired Bible example

01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:31.850
that of the Shulamite girl,

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:34.850
who was being urged by the young women in Solomon's court

01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:37.850
to accept his amorous attentions.

01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:39.850
But despite the pressure,

01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:41.850
the Shulamite girl remained in control

01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:43.850
for no one was going to push her into something

01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:45.850
that she did not want to do.

01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:47.850
Olivia got the point.

01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:49.850
As she thought to herself,

01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:52.850
my peace comes from doing the right thing.

01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:54.850
Nobody can make me stumble.

01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:56.850
I am a wall.

01:32:56.850 --> 01:32:59.850
It is obvious that the mother had a real love for God's word.

01:32:59.850 --> 01:33:01.850
New it well.

01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:03.850
And calmly and skillfully used it

01:33:03.850 --> 01:33:05.850
to guide the thinking of her children

01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:08.850
to keep them from stumbling.

01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:12.159
So many people these days put God's word

01:33:12.159 --> 01:33:16.159
out of their mind to prevent it from influencing their life.

01:33:16.159 --> 01:33:18.159
But as the world's morals decline,

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:20.159
we must stick loyally to God's word

01:33:20.159 --> 01:33:24.159
to conform our conduct to his pure and holy thinking

01:33:24.159 --> 01:33:27.159
and strengthen our determination to live

01:33:27.159 --> 01:33:30.659
by his standards.

01:33:30.659 --> 01:33:33.659
That is just what the Apostle Paul urged us to do

01:33:33.659 --> 01:33:36.659
at Romans chapter 12 and verse 2.

01:33:36.659 --> 01:33:38.659
If you would turn there please,

01:33:38.659 --> 01:33:41.659
Romans 12 and verse 2,

01:33:41.659 --> 01:33:43.659
Paul wrote,

01:33:43.659 --> 01:33:47.659
and stop being molded by this system of things

01:33:47.659 --> 01:33:51.659
but be transformed by making your mind over

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:53.659
so that you may prove to yourselves

01:33:53.659 --> 01:33:57.659
the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

01:33:57.659 --> 01:34:02.659
God's word strengthens us to resist conforming

01:34:02.659 --> 01:34:05.659
to the corrupting practices of Satan's world

01:34:05.659 --> 01:34:09.659
and to suppress temptations toward wrongdoing.

01:34:09.659 --> 01:34:13.659
Now as we prove to ourselves that the will of God is good

01:34:13.659 --> 01:34:15.659
and perfect,

01:34:15.659 --> 01:34:18.659
then we should also accept that loyally obeying God

01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:20.659
is the best way of living.

01:34:20.659 --> 01:34:22.659
There is a direct connection between

01:34:22.659 --> 01:34:26.659
heeding scriptural teachings and obeying or enjoying

01:34:26.659 --> 01:34:29.659
genuine peace.

01:34:29.659 --> 01:34:33.659
However, for Jehovah's word to have such power in our lives,

01:34:33.659 --> 01:34:36.659
we need to read the Bible every day

01:34:36.659 --> 01:34:40.659
and meditate on why its counsel is beneficial.

01:34:40.659 --> 01:34:43.659
That means reading it at a pace that allows us

01:34:43.659 --> 01:34:46.659
to ponder on what we are reading.

01:34:46.659 --> 01:34:49.659
And doing this helps to fix in our minds the portions

01:34:49.659 --> 01:34:52.659
that are especially helpful to us.

01:34:52.659 --> 01:34:56.659
When asked why he reads the Bible every day,

01:34:56.659 --> 01:34:58.659
one Christian replied,

01:34:58.659 --> 01:35:01.659
if I repeatedly pray to Jehovah during the day

01:35:01.659 --> 01:35:04.659
and expect him to hear me,

01:35:04.659 --> 01:35:06.659
why shouldn't I also listen to God

01:35:06.659 --> 01:35:09.659
by reading his word every day?

01:35:09.659 --> 01:35:11.659
If we want to be a good friend,

01:35:11.659 --> 01:35:14.659
why would we do all the talking?

01:35:14.659 --> 01:35:17.659
He makes a very good point, doesn't he?

01:35:17.659 --> 01:35:20.659
Reading the Bible, we are listening to Jehovah

01:35:20.659 --> 01:35:24.659
and that is how we get his viewpoint on matters.

01:35:24.659 --> 01:35:30.659
So, do you allow God to speak to you every day?

01:35:30.659 --> 01:35:33.659
We can measure how effective our Bible reading is

01:35:33.659 --> 01:35:37.659
by the influence it has on our attitude and conduct.

01:35:37.659 --> 01:35:39.659
When our peace is disturbed,

01:35:39.659 --> 01:35:44.659
we can look into the source of divine wisdom for God's guidance.

01:35:44.659 --> 01:35:48.659
Speaking prophetically of anointed Christians at Isaiah 54-13,

01:35:48.659 --> 01:35:50.659
the prophet wrote,

01:35:50.659 --> 01:35:53.659
all your sons will be taught by Jehovah

01:35:53.659 --> 01:35:56.659
and their peace will be abundant.

01:35:56.659 --> 01:35:58.659
Now, those words apply in principle

01:35:58.659 --> 01:36:01.659
to Christ's other sheep as well.

01:36:01.659 --> 01:36:03.659
Thankfully, when Christ's anointed brothers,

01:36:03.659 --> 01:36:06.659
the faithful and discreet slave prepare spiritual food

01:36:06.659 --> 01:36:08.659
for us, such as this convention program,

01:36:08.659 --> 01:36:11.659
they hold firmly to Jehovah's word

01:36:11.659 --> 01:36:13.659
and they never water it down.

01:36:13.659 --> 01:36:16.659
We always receive spiritual instruction

01:36:16.659 --> 01:36:20.659
that upholds Jehovah's high moral standards.

01:36:20.659 --> 01:36:23.659
And we are blessed with abundant peace

01:36:23.659 --> 01:36:26.659
when we accept Jehovah's instruction.

01:36:26.659 --> 01:36:29.979
Isaiah penned another prophecy

01:36:29.979 --> 01:36:30.979
that is being fulfilled today

01:36:30.979 --> 01:36:34.979
and that we find at Isaiah 2 verses 2 through 4.

01:36:34.979 --> 01:36:36.979
He saw in a vision of the last days

01:36:36.979 --> 01:36:39.979
people from all the nations streaming to true worship

01:36:39.979 --> 01:36:41.979
and for what reason?

01:36:41.979 --> 01:36:43.979
Isaiah wrote of Jehovah

01:36:43.979 --> 01:36:46.979
he will instruct us about his ways

01:36:46.979 --> 01:36:49.979
and we will walk in his paths.

01:36:49.979 --> 01:36:51.979
And in what would this result?

01:36:51.979 --> 01:36:54.979
So that they will beat their swords into plowshairs

01:36:54.979 --> 01:36:57.979
and their spears into pruning shears.

01:36:57.979 --> 01:37:00.979
Nation will not lift up sword against nation

01:37:00.979 --> 01:37:04.979
nor will they learn war anymore.

01:37:04.979 --> 01:37:06.979
In his goodness, Jehovah is willing

01:37:06.979 --> 01:37:08.979
to teach we imperfect humans

01:37:08.979 --> 01:37:11.979
how to achieve genuine abundant peace,

01:37:11.979 --> 01:37:13.979
earthwide.

01:37:13.979 --> 01:37:15.979
And he does that through the pages

01:37:15.979 --> 01:37:17.979
of his own written word.

01:37:17.979 --> 01:37:21.979
What a privilege it is to be taught by our God.

01:37:21.979 --> 01:37:23.979
No matter what problem may threaten the peace

01:37:23.979 --> 01:37:25.979
of our personal life,

01:37:25.979 --> 01:37:28.979
our family, or our congregation,

01:37:28.979 --> 01:37:30.979
we are confident that the solution

01:37:30.979 --> 01:37:33.979
can be found in the Bible.

01:37:33.979 --> 01:37:36.979
And as we have learned from this symposium,

01:37:36.979 --> 01:37:38.979
our continued love for Jehovah,

01:37:38.979 --> 01:37:41.979
for our neighbor and for God's word,

01:37:41.979 --> 01:37:44.979
will lead to our enjoying everlasting peace

01:37:44.979 --> 01:37:46.979
in God's new world.

01:37:46.979 --> 01:37:50.670
Thank you, brothers,

01:37:50.670 --> 01:37:55.670
for teaching us how love motivates our pursuit of peace.

01:37:55.670 --> 01:37:58.670
Each of us now has an opportunity

01:37:58.670 --> 01:38:00.670
to praise Jehovah with song.

01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:04.670
We will sing song number 24 entitled

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:07.670
Come to Jehovah's Mountain,

01:38:07.670 --> 01:38:09.670
song number 24.
