00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.400
Let's discuss the theme, imitate Jesus and showing favor to lowly ones.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.199
Now, open up to Proverbs, please, chapter 19, and here's a beautiful

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:19.600
proverb in harmony with this theme. Proverbs 1917, it says,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.199
the one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah, and he, Jehovah,

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.799
will repay him for what he does. Well, that's a beautiful thought, isn't it?

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:40.600
We're going to lend to Jehovah. The Hebrew word for lowly literally means

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.799
thin, lean slender. So it's someone who is weak due to maybe some depressing

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:57.700
circumstance, poverty, illness. The English word lowly means bent low, and there's a

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.000
heavy weight on their back. They need help, they are lowly, and if you think

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.700
about it, all of us are lowly at times, aren't we? There are times there's a heavy weight on our back,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.099
and we're bent low. And of course, we know that Jesus set the perfect example,

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:19.900
in showing favor to lowly ones. But now here's a question, what qualities

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.400
enable him to do so? Well, let's discuss three, and those same three qualities

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:32.599
will put us in position to show this favor to lowly ones and lend to Jehovah.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:39.400
Number one, compassion. Now, compassion is defined in the insight book as a

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.400
sympathetic awareness of another suffering coupled with a desire to

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.599
alleviate that suffering. So in other words, we're keenly aware of someone

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:57.099
suffering, and we want to do something about it to alleviate it. Open up to Mark,

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.599
chapter six, please. Now, here's a beautiful example of Jesus showing compassion.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:11.539
Mark six, and please, let's read verse 34. It says, well, on getting out of the

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:20.840
boat, he saw a large crowd, and he was moved with pity for them, because they

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.840
were as sheep without a shepherd, and he started to teach them many things.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.840
Now, let's think about the circumstances. Jesus was very tired. He really

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.840
needed some quiet time, some downtime. I didn't even have time to eat a meal in peace.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.840
So he gets in a boat. He goes to an isolated area, but a crowd of thousands of

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.840
people found out where he was going. They got there ahead of him. Now, when Jesus

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.840
got out of the boat, how could he have reacted? He could have immediately

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.840
dismissed that crowd. Maybe he made an appointment with him. Now, come back tomorrow

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.840
or the same time tomorrow, and then I'll help you. Or he could have maybe

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.840
spent 10 or 15 minutes with them, taught them a few things, flipped them a few

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.840
spiritual tidbits, we could say, and then sent them on their way. But no,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.840
pity, compassion moved him to teach them many things, and apparently several

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.840
hours was involved, because the account says that while he was teaching them the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.840
hour grew late. In fact, he even fed them physically before he sent them on their

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.840
way. But what was it that moved him to do this? Compassion. So similarly, compassion

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.840
will move us to extend favor to the lowly. If we don't have this right feeling

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.840
toward them, we might not even notice the suffering they're experiencing, and

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.840
we're certainly not going to be moved to do anything about it. But compassion

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.840
will move us to visit them, console them, excuse me, provide transportation,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.840
give them a gift, whatever it takes to show favor to these lowly ones. But now let's

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.840
get our second quality, humility. Please go to Philippians chapter 2.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.839
Philippians chapter 2, and here's a beautiful scripture talking about Jesus'

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:26.839
humility. Beginning at verse 5, it says, keep this mental attitude in you that

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:35.500
was also in Christ Jesus, who although he was existing in God's form, gave

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.500
no consideration to a seizure, namely that he should be equal to God. No, but he

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.500
emptied himself and took a slave's form and became human. More than that, when he

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.500
came as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, yes,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:03.500
death on a torture stake. Now first contemplate the humility it took for Jesus to

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:11.500
empty himself of his glorious heavenly body, his lofty heavenly home, his

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.500
privileges, his position. But then when he got here on the earth, think of the

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:24.500
humility as he dealt with a lowly disease, dying offspring of Adam. Now think about it,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.500
he was the only perfect person on the planet. He could have become hypercritical,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.500
comparing how perfect he was with how imperfect everybody else was. He could have

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.500
really put people down, but instead he slave for, ministered to, taught, washed

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.500
the feet of these lowly offspring of Adam, treating them in effect as though they were

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.500
superior to himself. Now to appreciate perhaps a little better this humility of

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.500
Jesus, and this really doesn't do the job, this illustration, but it may help.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:09.500
Imagine that you are confined to a home or institution for mentally handicapped

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.500
individuals. Now you're not mentally handicapped, but you're confined to this

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.500
home, this institution where these ones are cared for. Now it would be very easy to

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.500
develop a superiority attitude toward the other residents, but can you imagine

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.500
slaving for them, serving them, ministering to them, washing their feet?

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.500
Now that would take humility with him, and perhaps that does illustrate a little

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:42.500
bit. The humility of this perfect man, uniquely perfect, dealing with a handicapped

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:50.500
offspring of Adam. Well, that same quality of humility will move us to perform humble

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:57.500
down to earth task in behalf of these ones that may be more disadvantaged than we

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.500
are at least right now. To show them this favor, these ones that are experiencing

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.500
poverty, weakness, they're bent low by some depressing circumstance.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:14.500
Well, let's get one more quality, approachability. Now what do you think of when you

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.500
think of approachability? Well, the dictionary defines it this way possible

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:27.500
to approach accessible, easy to talk to or deal with, friendly. Open up to Mark

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:34.500
chapter 10, please, and here's a scripture that talks about this approachability

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.500
of Jesus. He attracted people of all different backgrounds to him.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.500
Mark chapter 10, and just looking at some of these verses, look at verse 1,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.500
crowds gathered to him. Verse 2, the Pharisees felt free to approach.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.500
Look at verse 10, the disciples approached and began to question him.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:02.500
Verse 13, people brought their young children. Verse 17, a man ran up and fell

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:11.500
at Jesus. Well, here you have in those five verses, crowds, the Pharisees,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.500
Jesus disciples, parents with their little children, just a stranger, a man.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:24.500
Jesus certainly was approachable to people. See, it was obvious that his accessibility,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:31.500
but also undoubtedly his countenance, his friendly, facial expressions.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:37.500
See, made him appear not too busy for people, but they felt free to approach him.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.500
Well, similarly, we should do our best to develop this godly quality.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.500
Now it's true we're limited and we're imperfect, but we should do our best to try

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:53.500
to appear accessible. See, not always too busy for others.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:09:00.500
We should strive to maintain warm, joyful, friendly facial expressions so that

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.500
we appear accessible to people. And then as they approach, we can show them

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:11.500
favor and we can lend to Jehovah. Well, there we have three qualities that will help us.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:19.500
Did you get them? We talked about compassion, humility, and approachability.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.500
And how are we going to benefit if we show this favor to lowly ones?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:31.500
Well, Psalm 41.1 says, Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:37.500
So Jehovah says you're going to be happy. And then it goes on to say, Jehovah will rescue him

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.500
in the day of calamity. And that applies to calamities now, the big calamity,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.500
the great tribulation. And then remember that scripture we read at the beginning,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:55.500
Proverbs 1917, when we show favor to the lowly, we're lending to Jehovah.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:02.500
And if we do that, we give to these lowly ones with not expecting anything in return.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:10.500
Jehovah views it as a loan made to him. And he's going to repay that loan with favor and blessings.
