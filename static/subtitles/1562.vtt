00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.780
Oh, Alice.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.780
Hi, Debbie.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.779
I've got to tell you what I just heard yesterday.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.779
Well, remember Bethany, who used to attend some of our meetings years ago?

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:15.779
Yes!

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.780
Has she started going back to the meetings again?

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.280
Not at all.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.280
She left the man that she's living with to move in with another.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.780
Wait, you've been keeping in touch with her?

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.780
Well, no, I haven't talked her directly.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.780
But you know, work gets around.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.780
Anyway, can you believe it?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.780
Debbie, we both know Bethany has done a lot of bad things since she stopped attending the meetings.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.780
And I really hope she makes changes and comes back.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.780
But in the meantime, do you really think we should be spending our time talking about all the bad things she's doing right now?

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
Well, probably not.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.780
I just figured, since we all grew up together, you want to know how far from the truth she's gotten.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:16.730
But Debbie, love does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.730
You know what?

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.730
You're right.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.730
Why talk about this?

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.730
We have so many good things to talk about.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.730
Yes, we do.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.730
Like this morning.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.730
Do you remember that call we went on last week?

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.730
Well, Helen and I went back again this morning and the lady was home.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.730
She invited us in and we placed a book.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.730
Really?

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.730
Yes.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.730
We even got to show her one of our videos and she said she may come to the meeting this Sunday.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.730
That's wonderful, I hope.
