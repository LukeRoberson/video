00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:09.650
Welcome. In this program, we'll update you on the situation of our brothers and sisters

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:18.089
around the world who are imprisoned for their faith. But first, here's an update about

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:25.309
this year's convention. In some parts of the world, they declare the good news regional

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:34.710
conventions are now underway. It's a beautiful program. Let's hear from a few who recently

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.350
attended. A lot of the friends have made incredible sacrifices to support the convention here.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.710
Well, I had to negotiate some off of work. We also had to ask for a leave from school.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.189
Got it really early? Every effort you make, it's definitely worth it. You can't put a

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:59.909
price on being here. We get to see brothers that we don't often get to see. Also, when

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:06.750
you're here, you get the hugs. I love hugs. A virtual hug is okay. A real hug is better.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.469
It's a big difference between being here in person and watching online. It's so much

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:20.109
more alive. I love the singing. There's a power that resonates from the audience when

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.750
we're all singing together. That really strengthens us and gives us a boost. Also, it's been

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.989
incredible that we get to see episode one of the good news according to Jesus. Next time

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:35.670
you do your Bible reading, you really can picture these beautiful moments and see how important

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.790
they were. What impressed me is that I've read all those verses that were highlighted

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.790
and never ever, not one time did I get emotional, but it brought it to life today and I did

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.349
get emotional. You feel like you're there. The spiritual feasts enrich us and strengthen

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:01.750
us spiritually. I think I want to come to this convention three or four times. For me,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.790
there's no better place than being among the group of Jehovah's people. Every time I'm

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.349
reminded what a beautiful, huge spiritual family we're part of. It brings us so much joy

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.189
to be with our brothers and sisters. You just don't want to miss it. We encourage all

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:26.110
of you to endeavor to attend the convention in person. By doing so, you'll not only benefit

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:35.710
from the program, but also receive much encouragement from associating with many dear friends, perhaps

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:44.550
even some whom you haven't seen for some time. Of course, we understand that those limited

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:55.550
by age and health may have to tune in to the streaming program. This year, a real highlight

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.949
will be the fifteen special conventions that are scheduled. The first was held on the

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:12.509
weekend of June 7-9 on the island of Guadalupe. Brothers Jeff Winter and Clive Martin had

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:22.310
the privilege to serve the convention. Delegates came from 11 lands and there was a peak attendance

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:35.789
of 8,602. On the Saturday, 74 were baptized. We rejoice to see the love and unity of our

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:44.189
international brotherhood. Now for the rest of this program, we want to update you on the

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:50.949
situation of our brothers and sisters who are imprisoned for their faith. This will help

00:03:50.949 --> 00:04:02.750
all of us to follow the wise direction at Hebrews 13-3, which says, Keep in mind those in prison,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:11.270
as though you were imprisoned with them, and those being mistreated since you yourselves

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:22.910
also are in the body. As of June 17, there are over 199 brothers and sisters imprisoned for

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:32.790
their faith. Where are they? There are nine imprisoned in Crimea, 39 in Eritrea, eight in Singapore,

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:42.310
and over 17 in other lands. The largest number of imprisoned brothers and sisters is in Russia,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:54.949
where there are 126. What about South Korea? Although our brothers there are no longer routinely

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:03.709
imprisoned for neutrality, they're enduring a harsh form of alternative service. Here

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:13.310
required to serve for three years and to live and work exclusively in prisons. Brother Mark

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:21.949
Sanderson recently visited two groups of brothers at prisons where they're carrying out their alternative

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:31.790
service. We hope that this situation will improve in the future, and we continue to pray for these

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:40.589
faithful brothers and their families. Sometimes we might think that only brothers are imprisoned

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:49.389
around the world, but we actually have 12 sisters in Eritrea who are in prison for their faith,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:59.069
and there are eight sisters in Russia who are in prison because of their faith. These dear

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:08.189
sisters need our continued prayers. Also, many brothers and sisters are enduring long prison

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:16.990
sentences, and at times even physical mistreatment. This was recent in the case for brother Rhenaut

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:25.470
Kieramo in Russia. In April 2024, several prisoners demanded that our brother reveal the names

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:32.750
of other Jehovah's Witnesses that he courageously refused in turn the prisoners beat and tortured

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:44.509
him for four days even using a taser. We continue to pray for brother Kieramo and all 199 brothers

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:50.990
and sisters who are in prison for their faith, and we don't forget their families either.

00:06:51.389 --> 00:07:00.269
The faith and integrity of our imprisoned brothers and sisters reminds us of the words of Romans 1221.

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:11.069
Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good. Yes,

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:20.269
they're enduring the opposition and severe tests of faith, but they've not let themselves be conquered

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:30.829
by it. Rather, they keep conquering the evil with the good. We truly love and respect these dear brothers

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:37.790
and sisters. It's interesting that as our brothers and sisters endure these hardships,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:46.990
they often have unique opportunities to share the good news. That was the case for dozens of

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:58.189
witnesses in the city of Belgrade, Russia, back in 2018. Officials rated 22 homes all on the same

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:06.589
day. As you watch the following video, notice how our brothers and sisters gave a good witness

00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:12.910
and maintained their joy. How did they keep conquering the evil with the good?

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:20.509
Early in the morning of May 17, 2018, we were woken up by a loud knock on the door.

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:27.069
Through the door, I asked, who's there? They said, it's the police. Of course, we felt very stressed.

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:36.919
Naturally, we started praying silently to Jehovah. Later, we learned that this operation was given

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:46.429
the name Judgement Day and about 150 officers were involved. When a criminal case was initiated,

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:54.730
all my accounts were frozen and I had to go to various banks. When the staff would see me coming

00:08:54.730 --> 00:09:02.409
through the door, they greeted me with, oh, our little extremist has come and gave me a friendly smile.

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:11.240
One of the times when I was going to the FSB for interrogation, I called a taxi. The taxi driver asked,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:18.600
what is this address? Where are you going? I said, it's the FSB building. He asked, are you going to work?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.559
I said, no, not to work. I'm going there for interrogation. He couldn't believe it. He got very

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:30.039
confused. I was able to tell him that I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses and that a criminal case had

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:36.120
been initiated against me for my faith. A few days later, I went back to the FSB office and called

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:43.320
another taxi. To my surprise, the same car arrived with the same driver and on this trip, I was able to

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.919
tell in more detail which prophecies are recorded in the Bible on this subject and we had a good

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:56.679
conversation. When we went for interrogations, we wanted to show the investigators by our behavior,

00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:03.799
words and kindness that we are not extremists, that Jehovah's Witnesses are kind, sympathetic people.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:12.120
At the end of the investigation, we decided to make them cards. We tried to say nice things to

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:21.309
everyone. We mentioned their good kind points. The lawyer said that he was very worried and added,

00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:25.789
I see that you are good people and people like you shouldn't be in prison.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:32.269
I'm sure that your God will help you, but please, our tour do not deviate from this path.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:40.940
Stay firm to the end. When our child began, us four sisters ended up before the same judge.

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:49.740
She was very prejudice and negative toward us. She interrupted us. She pointed out that we're

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:56.539
uneducated and she humiliated us in every possible way. And at some point, we wondered,

00:10:56.539 --> 00:11:02.460
Jehovah brought us here to witness. But how can we witness to a person who won't let us say anything?

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.820
We decided to pray to Jehovah for him to soften her heart so that we might eventually give a good

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:16.299
witness to her. We also made an effort to be tactful and polite. We always greeted her.

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:23.820
I resolved to express kindness by my tone of voice, my words, and my face.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:33.019
And at one point, something happened. Things started to go completely differently. She started

00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:38.539
listening to us and greeting us. While we were watching the video recordings of our meetings

00:11:38.539 --> 00:11:46.620
in court, the judge was making notes. And then she asked, where did he read it from? At first,

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:52.940
out of fear, I couldn't remember. Then I said, from the Bible, she says, that's obvious.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:12:00.620
But from where in the Bible did he read? I told her, from Job. She's like, what? I said, Job. She

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:08.700
asked again, what? Now my lawyer said, Job. She said, oh, Job, and wrote it down. And I added 42, 10.

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:18.649
When she read the verdict, she even asked several times, Irina, am I pronouncing the name of God

00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:25.850
correctly? I pray to Jehovah saying, Jehovah, today is the judgment. I want your name to be glorified

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:31.690
today. I said, Jehovah, please let the judge pronounce your name correctly 10 times,

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.769
and put the stress in the correct place because she had a problem with that.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:42.570
And what do you think? By the end of the judgment, she had pronounced God's name correctly 10 times.

00:12:46.889 --> 00:12:53.690
When I was sentenced, I was met by many friends. There were a lot of people and I was given a lot

00:12:53.690 --> 00:13:00.730
of flowers. A woman came up to me with two of her friends, smiling she asked me, tell me please,

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:08.009
what's the occasion? You look so beautiful. I smiled at her and said, you know, I'm one of Job's

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:14.009
witnesses. And I was given a two and a half year suspended sentence today. She and her friends were

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:21.049
smiling and they just froze. I work from home. So when my clients came and saw so many flowers,

00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:27.690
they asked, where did they come from? What was the occasion? And of course, it gave me the

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.730
opportunity to say that the big occasion is having such loving brothers and sisters.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:41.049
Of the 23 brothers and sisters who were prosecuted, four were taken into custody and are now

00:13:41.049 --> 00:13:51.470
serving time in a penal colony. We found out that our husbands were going to be transported,

00:13:52.110 --> 00:14:00.600
so we went to the station to see them off. On the train, they were asked, who were all the people

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:07.559
who came to see you? Some wondered if it was some kind of support group. The brothers were being

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:17.929
taken to prison, yet this group was rejoicing and singing songs. Looking back, I feel truly grateful

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:29.960
because it was not easy, but Jehovah sustained us throughout the trial. But there was a moment when

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:39.080
I felt that my faith was weakening. And I asked our tour, why don't I feel supported? And our tour helped

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:54.090
me a lot. He said that you are enduring. This is Jehovah's support. You have not renounced him,

00:14:54.090 --> 00:15:00.409
you have not forsaken him, and that tells you that he is with you. That brief thought strengthened

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:06.970
my faith. And I realized that at that moment, Satan was putting pressure on my faith. And I need to

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:12.889
strengthen my faith, not only in Jehovah, but also in Jehovah's presence in difficult situations.

00:15:14.889 --> 00:15:22.090
Satan wants to steal our joy, but that's impossible because joy belongs to Jehovah. He owns it.

00:15:23.129 --> 00:15:28.649
Then what does Satan do? He wants to hide this joy from us so that we don't see it.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:35.929
But Jehovah, as a good, reliable friend, has always helped us to see reasons for joy.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.559
They wanted to silence us so that we wouldn't talk about Jehovah anymore.

00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:48.039
But in reality, they gave us even more opportunities to talk about God's name.

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:10.860
Don't you just love their zeal and joy? They're determined to keep preaching and to keep their

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:20.379
integrity. They had unique opportunities to give a witness, and they relied on Jehovah to do so.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:28.700
Of course, we know that all of you brothers and sisters are facing challenges of one source or

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:37.019
another. I'm sure that hearing these experiences will encourage and motivate all of us to keep

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:44.220
relying on Jehovah and to keep preaching no matter what challenges we face.

00:16:45.659 --> 00:16:53.179
Yes, with Jehovah's help, we can keep conquering the evil with the good.

00:16:55.179 --> 00:17:04.380
Brothers and sisters, let's keep in mind those in prison, as though we were in prison with them.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:14.380
We're so proud of all of you for your endurance and your zeal. We love you all very much.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:20.380
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
