00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.379
Darren, could you read Psalm 116 in verse 12?

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.380
It says, with what will I repay Jehovah?

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.380
For all the good he has done for me.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.210
How can Psalm 116 in verse 12 give us courage right now?

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.210
Great.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.210
Well, Jehovah's always done well for us in the past.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.210
So we can trust He'll do the same for us now and in the future.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.210
Thank you.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.210
That's so true that He's always done good things for us.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.210
But from what I've seen, what really makes a difference is how we respond to that goodness.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.210
For some in the congregation, those good things became a test of their loyalty.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.210
We continue with our meeting.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.210
We have a letter to read.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.210
To all congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses, dear brothers and sisters,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.210
if we are to have Jehovah's favor and blessing as individuals.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.209
They found fault with what the organization was doing or not doing.

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:12.209
As we work together with you, shoulder to shoulder, your brothers, the Christian.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.140
Now paragraph 12 gives more detail on our adjusted understanding of this exciting account.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.140
Let's read it.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
Brother Perez, please read paragraph 12 for us.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.140
Soon, they criticize any teaching or arrangement they didn't agree with.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.140
And whether they realized it or not, their critical attitude was eroding their own loyalty.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.140
And it was affecting others.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.700
And before we ask the question for that paragraph, who would like to read Psalms 116 verse 12?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.700
Kyle, please.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.700
Eventually, some were no longer our brothers.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.700
But the more grateful our family was for what Jehovah gave us,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:17.020
the stronger our attachment to him became.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.020
So I've learned to have appreciation for everything.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.020
Everything Jehovah has done for us and for his organization.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.020
It's helped us all make it to this point.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:47.479
And I'm sure it will help us stay loyal through the rest of the great tribulation.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.479
I know that look.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.909
You haven't experienced, don't you?

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:54.909
I do, but it's...

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.909
It can't be anything I don't already know.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.909
It's not exactly in my list of things to share with my little brother.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.909
There's no pressure, Elaine.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.909
Only tell it if you want to.

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.539
It's okay.

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:14.949
For me, I struggled with negative thinking.

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:15.949
No way.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.289
Yeah.

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:26.289
But I had a good friend who always helped and listened and helped me learn how to fight it.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.289
And I'll always be grateful.

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.289
I would pray.

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:35.289
But at times, the feelings were so strong.

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:40.650
I didn't know what to do.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.650
I know, I know, that must be so hard for you.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.650
Well, they have a stop feeling like this.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.650
Don't worry about if it's going to stop.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.650
Let's talk about ways you can take control when it happens.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.650
Take control?

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.650
You know, the scriptures tell us as Christians.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.650
But we pray for self-control in our actions.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.650
But do you know we need that same self-control for our thoughts?

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.650
I never thought about it that way before.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.650
The scriptures tell us how.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.650
Can we read one together?

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.649
Yeah, really like that.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.649
It's in 2 Corinthians, chapter 10.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:25.649
In verse number 5, you're going to like this scripture.

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:27.649
Chapter 10, verse 5.

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:32.750
Do you feel like reading it?

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.750
We are overturning, reasonings.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.750
And every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.750
And we are bringing every thought in the captivity

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.750
to make it obedient to the Christ.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.750
Karen showed me what it meant

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.750
to bring my negative thoughts in the captivity

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.750
and to make them obedient to the Christ.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.750
I had to know what my negative thoughts were.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.750
All of them can write them down.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.750
And for each one, find what Jehovah thinks

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.750
and then find scriptures that I could remember

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.750
each time that negative thought returned.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.750
I kept that list with me at all times.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.750
It was a slow process,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.750
but with Jehovah's help and with Karen's,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.750
I've learned how to fight the battle against negative thoughts.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.750
Evelyn, that was so brave of you to share.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.750
Well, just listening to everyone else's stories about loyalty,

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.750
it made me think about what I needed to do to stay loyal.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.750
Now, Elaine, if you don't mind me asking,

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.750
how did you see that as a test of loyalty?

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.750
Well, one scripture I memorized,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.750
verse Corinthians 9.25, it says,

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.750
now everyone competing in a contest

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.750
exercises self-control in all things.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.750
So if Jehovah's telling me,

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.750
I need to exercise self-control in all things,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.750
even my thinking, then I'm loyal to Jehovah when I try.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.750
Elaine, you are to be commended for what you did

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:37.720
and for seeing the need.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.720
I'm so glad you guys meet it safely.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.720
It's getting bad out there now.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.720
Chris, were you able to check on all of the other groups?

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.720
Yes, Brother Brown, I took account of each group.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720
Thank you.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.730
So you've been visiting each group,

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.730
even with all that's going on out there?

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.730
Yes, but there have been some scary moments.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.730
Still, we're going to shepherd all of the groups

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.680
for as long as we still can.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.680
The brothers really appreciate you making the sacrifice to do this.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:18.389
And you too, Shelley, for supporting Chris.

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.389
Is everybody okay?

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:21.389
Everyone's fine.

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.389
They're getting used to doing without some for the first time.

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:30.389
You and Shelley said a good example for keeping your life simple.

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:34.389
Thanks, but honestly, that wasn't always the case.

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:36.389
What do you mean?

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.389
Well, one day we were watching the video,

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.389
we live a simple life.

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:48.389
And it really helped us to take a good look at our lives.

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.389
We were both pioneering,

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:54.389
but still living a comfortable life.

00:07:54.389 --> 00:08:02.629
And we started wondering,

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:06.629
our love for Jehovah moved us to pioneer,

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:10.629
but could it move us to take the next step?

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:13.629
After meditating and praying about it,

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:16.629
the answer became obvious.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:18.629
When we sold our house,

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:21.629
found a little apartment in the territory,

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:24.629
took some time to adjust.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:28.629
But what it did for our relationship with Jehovah

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:30.629
was so worth it.

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:33.940
With nothing to tie us down,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.940
we were blessed to go to the School for Kingdom of Angelizers.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.940
And then that's when you all met us.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.320
I remember when you guys moved here,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.320
everything you owned fit into your car and trailer.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:56.539
How much longer will this keep up?

00:08:56.539 --> 00:08:58.539
Chris, please say another prayer for us,

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:01.539
and I think we should look at some more scriptures that'll help us.

00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:16.659
Do you see anything?

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:19.659
Do you see any witnesses?

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.659
What are they?

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:25.659
Psalm 27.

00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:27.659
He's really going to help us.

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:30.659
Jehovah is my light and my salvation.

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:32.659
Who should I fear?

00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:35.659
Jehovah is the stronghold of my life.

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:37.659
Who should I dread?

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:40.659
When evil men attack me to devour my flesh,

00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:44.659
my adversaries and my enemies were the ones who stumbled and fell,

00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:47.659
though an army should set up camp against me,

00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:50.659
my heart will not fear.

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:53.659
The war should break out against me,

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:56.659
even then I will remain confident.

00:09:56.659 --> 00:09:59.659
One thing I have asked of Jehovah.

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:02.659
Where would I be if I did not have faith

00:10:02.659 --> 00:10:05.659
that I would see Jehovah's goodness in the land of the living?

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:07.659
Hope in Jehovah.

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:10.659
Be courageous and strong of heart.

00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:13.659
Yes, hope in Jehovah.

00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:15.659
Thank you, Brother Brown.

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:17.659
That Psalm is very faith strengthening.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:21.659
It is, Chris, especially the question at verse 13.

00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:25.659
Where would I be if I did not have faith?

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:28.659
I think all of us can identify with that question.

00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:32.659
Absolutely. Without faith, none of us would be here.

00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:34.659
All of us here.

00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:37.659
And all of our brothers everywhere.

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:41.659
At this hour, we can all feel good

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:46.659
that we've worked hard to build faith in Jehovah's promises.

00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:50.659
We've all resisted temptations

00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:54.659
to serve God half-heartedly with a date in mind

00:10:54.659 --> 00:11:00.289
or for some selfish reason.

00:11:00.289 --> 00:11:04.289
Instead of just going through the motions of being a disciple,

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:09.289
our faith is real, it's genuine.

00:11:09.289 --> 00:11:13.289
Paul called that faith faith without hypocrisy.

00:11:13.289 --> 00:11:18.289
And to have seen you build that kind of faith

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:21.289
just warms my heart.

00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:26.289
You studied God's Word to better understand His ways

00:11:26.289 --> 00:11:29.289
and His promises.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:33.289
That has made your faith strong today.

00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:35.289
You reasoned,

00:11:35.289 --> 00:11:38.289
on Jehovah's past dealings with you

00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:41.289
and that has given you strength

00:11:41.289 --> 00:11:44.289
to remain loyal under test

00:11:44.289 --> 00:11:49.289
and your faith has led you here

00:11:49.289 --> 00:11:52.289
as loyal servants of Jehovah.

00:11:52.289 --> 00:11:59.289
Confident that Psalm 97 verse 10 applies to you personally.

00:11:59.289 --> 00:12:19.139
Jehovah is guarding the lives of His loyal ones.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:26.830
It's not the basement.
