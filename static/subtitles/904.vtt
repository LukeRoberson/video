My wife had some plans with these other two sisters, so that'll be a good group.

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:11.359
For an ex-group, Frances, a brother and sister Kenny, and a brother Hodges.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.759
It'll be the next group, and that just leaves my side.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.640
I love brother Hodges, and brother and sister Kenny.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.250
But today, I just want to be with my friends.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.500
Besides, brother Madison just got here, and he'd love to be in this group.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.899
It's fine. When the meeting's over, I'll just make my own arrangements, and jump in with my friends.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:56.880
Not that one, honey. It's the other one.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.319
Wait, what am I doing? I'm so focused on what I want. I'm not considering what others need.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.599
These weren't the arrangements I hoped for. But what kind of example would I be setting?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.879
Or blessing what I get. If I do my own thing.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.959
Brother Kenny, can I help you with that?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.719
Yes, thank you.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.650
Thank you, Frances.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.769
You're welcome, sister Kenny.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.609
Thank you, Frances.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.689
My arthritis has acting up today, and having you with us is an answer to prayers.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.090
Brother Kenny, I love working with you, sister Kenny.
