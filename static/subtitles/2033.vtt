00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.219
and introduction to the Book of Judges.

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:10.220
The Book of Judges was written by the Prophet Samuel,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.220
who completed it in about 1100 BCE.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.219
Judges covers a period of some 330 years,

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:25.219
from about 1450 to approximately 1120 BCE.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:30.219
The book primarily discusses the exploits of the judges,

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:37.649
whom Jehovah used to deliver his people from oppression.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.649
In chapter 1, we read that the Israelites do not drive out

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.649
all the pagan inhabitants of the land.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.649
Instead, they subject some of them to forced labor.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.649
In chapter 2, an angel warns the Israelites that

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.649
because they have not listened to Jehovah,

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.649
the remaining people of the land will ensnare them in false worship.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.650
In chapters 3 to 16, we see that the angels' words begin to be fulfilled

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
after the death of Joshua and his generation.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.650
In an often repeated cycle, the Israelites take up false worship,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.650
Jehovah abandons them to their foes,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.650
the people cry out for help, and Jehovah raises up judges to deliver them.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.650
The 12 judges are Athniel, Ehad, Shamgar, Berik, Gideon,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:44.650
Tola, Jair, Jetha, Ibsen, Elon, Abdon, and Samson.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.519
Did you know?

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.519
The judges described in this book were men of faith

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:56.519
who led and delivered God's people,

00:01:56.519 --> 00:02:00.519
recognizing Jehovah as the true leader and deliverer.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:04.519
They were not judges in the legal sense of the word.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:13.400
In chapter 3, Judges Athniel and Ehad deliver the Israelites

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.400
from servitude to the kings of Mesopotamia and Moab.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.400
In chapter 4, a prophetess named Deborah sends for a man of faith named Berik.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.400
She tells him that Jehovah will grant him victory over Cicera,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.400
the chief of the army of Canaanite King Jaban, who is oppressing Israel.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.400
Jehovah gives Cicera's entire army into the hands of Berik,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.400
not so much as one man remains.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.400
Cicera himself is executed by a woman named Jail.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.400
In chapter 6 to 8, Jehovah uses Judge Gideon

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.400
and just 300 men to take the lead in delivering Israel

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400
from Midianite oppression.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.400
Chapters 11 and 12 discuss the exploits of Judge Jephtha.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.400
With Jehovah's help, he subdues the Ammonites

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.400
who, along with the Philistines, had oppressed Israel for 18 years.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.400
Chapters 13 to 16 describe the exploits of Judge Sampson,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.400
a Nazarite to whom Jehovah gives extraordinary physical strength.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.400
Sampson takes the lead in saving Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.400
The events in chapters 17 to 21 fit an earlier period of time.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.400
In chapter 17, a man in Ephraim named Micah,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.400
who has a house of gods,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.400
hires a young Levite named Jonathan to serve as his priest.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.400
Jonathan, however, is not of the priestly family.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.400
In chapter 18, hundreds of Danites,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.400
who are on their way to conquer land for their tribe,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.400
make a stop at Micah's house.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.400
They steal his gods and take Jonathan to be their priest.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
In chapters 19 and 20,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.400
men of the Benjaminite City of Gibbia commit sex crimes

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.399
against the concubine of a Levite.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.399
The Benjaminites fail to hand over the guilty men,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.399
so the other tribes war against Benjamin,

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:26.399
almost wiping out the tribe.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:33.269
As you read the book of Judges,

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:37.269
note the harm that can come to those who leave Jehovah.

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:41.269
Observe how merciful God is when his people repent

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:44.269
and cry out to him for help.

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:47.269
And see why we can trust Jehovah,

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:50.269
our great judge, to deliver us from all our enemies

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:52.269
by means of his kingdom.
