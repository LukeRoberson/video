00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:07.190
Our text declesiastes 7, 8, says in its entirety.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.189
Better is the end of a matter than the beginning,

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:17.190
but then it adds better to be patient than to show a hot-y spirit.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.190
Well, if we're patient, sometimes a very grim-looking circumstance

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.190
becomes much better in the end than we could have ever imagined at the beginning.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.189
Well, would you have a Bible example where this principle actually plays out that way?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.189
First Kings chapter 20, please.

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:38.189
First Kings 20.

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:45.189
King Ben Hadad of Syria and 32 other kings are fighting against Israel.

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:50.189
So the beginning is not looking very good for Israel.

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:56.189
In fact, if you look at verse 7, verse 20 verse 7 says that the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said

00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:03.189
take note, please, and see this man, Ben Hadad, is bent on bringing calamity.

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:10.189
For he demanded my wives, my sons, my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him.

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.189
Well, pretty bleak-looking circumstances.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.189
But then after another interchange between the two kings,

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.189
it's obvious that Ben Hadad was hot-y.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.189
And verse 10, you can almost see him swaggering when he says,

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.189
so may the gods do to me and add to it if there's enough dust in Samaria

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.189
to give each of the people, follow me, a handful.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.189
Well, again, the beginning looks grim.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:44.189
But then Ahab, in response, he basically uses the principle of our text for today.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.189
In verse 11, the king of Israel answered, tell him the one who puts on his armor.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:57.189
You see, in the beginning, should not boast about himself like the one who takes it off in the end.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.189
Well, the end of the matter proved to be much better for Israel.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.189
Verse 21 says that the king of Israel inflicted a great defeat on the Syrians.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.189
Better was the end of the matter than its beginning.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:13.189
Oh, do we have another example where it states it very similarly?

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.189
Yes, judges.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.189
Judges 15, this is one of the accounts about Samson.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.189
And Samson wreaked havoc, he wreaked destruction upon the Philistines.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.189
So much so that they are now coming to Judah and all out revenge.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.189
Well, the men of Judah realized this and they're worried about being slaughtered.

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.189
So they caught up with Samson and handed him over to the Philistines.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:45.189
In 1513, the situation appears grim for Samson at first.

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:52.189
13 says, in the last sentence, they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the Craig.

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.189
Well, the Hathi Philistines were thrilled to have him bound and just handed over to them.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:03.189
In fact, in verse 14, it says, when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted triumphantly at meeting him.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.189
They couldn't wait to get their hands on him.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:13.189
Well, how did the situation for Samson prove better in the end than at the beginning?

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.189
Well, the verse says that Jehovah spirit empowered him and the fetters just melted off his hands.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:26.189
In 1516, Samson finds the jawbone of a donkey and he struck down a thousand Philistines.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.189
For Samson, the end of the matter was better than the beginning.

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.189
Well, how about Job?

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.889
Job 42.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:43.889
We're all familiar with how Job's test in the beginning were so trowsome.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.889
One tragic circumstance after another and then he was humiliated with verbal abuse from his false comforters.

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.229
It can't get much worse than that.

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:59.229
But because of his endurance and patience, how did it turn out in the end?

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:03.229
Well, verse 12 sounds very much like our text for today.

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:11.229
Job 42.12, it says, so Jehovah blessed the last part of Job's life more than the beginning.

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:17.230
Well, how has our, this scripture, Ecclesiastes 7.8 been treated in our literature.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.230
How has it been applied?

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.230
A couple of examples.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.230
A 1998 watchtower applied it to parents counseling their children.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.230
Now for Sam, during their teen years, they go through a phase in life

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.230
and their attitude is very frustrating to the parent.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.230
In fact, during the teen years, sometimes the parent will think there's no hope for this child.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.230
But if they're patient, what often results?

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.230
Well, we've read countless experiences in our magazines, heard them on JW Broadcasting,

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:56.230
of a wayward teen who is now an adult faithfully serving Jehovah.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.230
Better was the end of the matter than its beginning.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:07.230
A 1994 watchtower applied this to one who he feels that he's being overlooked for privileges.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.230
Instead of manifesting a prideful spirit, how much better to wait patiently?

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:20.230
In time when that privilege comes our way, the end of the matter is much better than it first.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.230
Some years ago, an older brother who had been serving as an elder moved to a new congregation.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.230
Well, the elders in the new congregation did not reappoint him right away.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.230
A couple of years went by and he was appointed as a ministerial servant, not an elder.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.230
Well, a couple more years went by and the former elders now doing a slow burn inside.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:50.230
And it manifested itself in his comments, even being critical of some of the decisions of the elders.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.959
Well, please find Philippians 2 with me.

00:05:54.959 --> 00:06:02.959
One of the elders on that body spoke to the brother and he explained that with his current disturbed attitude,

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:07.959
it's very unlikely the body of elders would welcome him aboard.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:15.959
He explained that his attitude was rooted in his view of position and the elder used Philippians 2, 5 through 9.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:20.959
Our first five councils were to have the mental attitude of Jesus.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:23.959
Well, what was Jesus' attitude about position?

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:27.959
Verse 6, it's talking about position.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:31.959
It says that Jesus did not try to seize Jehovah's position.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:39.959
And verse 7, just the opposite of going up the ladder, Jesus was willing to go down the ladder.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:42.959
I'd assume a lower position become a human.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:48.959
And then verse 8 says, more than that, when he came as a man,

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:52.959
he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.959
Yes, death on a torture stake.

00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:02.959
And then the bottom line in verse 9, for this very reason, for what reason?

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:09.959
Because of Jesus' humble attitude and accepting a lesser assignment to do Jehovah's further will,

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:15.959
and what was the result the verse continues, for this very reason God exalted him to a superior position,

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:18.959
gave him a name above every other name.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:25.959
Well, the elder asked the brother if he thought that he was manifesting the mental attitude of Jesus.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:33.959
And that brother said, no, he said, I'm too caught up in the position of being an elder.

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.959
So the elder asked him, well, what are you going to do?

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:42.959
The elder brother said, I need to reach out for the office of overseer all over again

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:46.959
and stop sulking about my position.

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:48.959
Well, what was the result?

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:51.959
For years, he had not been reappointed as an elder.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:59.959
Six months after that conversation, the body of elders unanimously recommended he be appointed as an elder.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.959
Why?

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:07.959
Ecclesiastes 7-8, better to be patient than hottie and spirit.

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:13.959
Well, that older brother, he died some years later, happily serving as an elder.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:17.959
Better was the end of the matter than its beginning.

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:24.199
Another application of the verse, the beginning and the rebellion and Eden,

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:26.199
it looked very bleak for the human family.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:30.199
But Jehovah had an arrangement to rectify matters, Jesus cooperated,

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:34.200
and what is that result in for you and I if we remain faithful?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.200
No question about it.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:42.200
Our reward at the end of the system will be better than at the first.
