00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:19.379
In my reading and my study, there are treasures that I find, and I'm searching, digging deeper.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:35.890
When I take a little time in the sea, it helps me understand just what the Bible means.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:44.890
Imagination and meditation, these are the things that help me see.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.969
They give me insight to help me do person.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:06.799
The person I should be, I can call some more faithful, some more not.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:16.359
Every example gives me insight to God's feelings and his thought.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:28.959
Sometimes my meditation makes me realize how I can be more pleasing in Jehovah's Eye.

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:41.510
Imagination and meditation, these are the things that help us see.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:55.560
To help us do what we should be, the persons we should be.
