00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.179
During those first few days, everything was a blur.

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:12.179
My sister Mary and I had never felt so empty and lost.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.460
I knew that if our Lord had been here, our brother would not have died.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.140
But through the tears and the pain, I had no doubt that the resurrection was real.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.229
Someday, someday he would live again.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.670
Who could have imagined it could happen that very day?

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:45.710
And right before our eyes, we wept here's joy and thanked our loving father in heaven, Jehovah.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:01:47.819
I lost my son, I lost part of myself, tried to stay busy, but everything felt empty.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:02:53.830
In my darkest times, Jehovah's words brought me comfort.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:05.229
Not a day goes by that I don't think about Brandon, not just memories of how it was,

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:13.110
but even more how wonderful it'll be to see him soon in God's new world.
