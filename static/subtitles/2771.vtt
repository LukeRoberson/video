00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.519
What if the demands of the state conflict with the commands of Jesus?

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.019
There's a Bible principle for that.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.519
Are you thinking of what it says at Acts chapter 5 verses 28 and 29

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.019
that we must obey God as ruler rather than men?

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:25.019
This is not disregard for the state, but rather reverence for God.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.019
If the state demands that we do what God forbids or refrain from doing

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.020
what God commands, then we believe God would consider that an invalid request.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.520
Now, one might say,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.520
I can imagine some situations where that viewpoint could get you into trouble.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.020
Jesus foretold as much at Matthew chapter 24 verse 9,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.020
where he said,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.520
you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520
More specifically at Revelation chapter 2 and verse 10,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.520
Jesus said that some of his disciples would be thrown into prison.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.519
Not all of us, but some.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.519
So we're not disappointed if we don't get thrown into prison,

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:11.519
but neither are we discouraged if we do.
