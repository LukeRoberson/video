00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.269
Did you know that in the Bible, Jehovah accretets just two of his worshipers as having integrity?

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.589
David and Job.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.730
Regarding David at 1 Kings 9-4, Jehovah told Solomon,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.910
"'Walk before me as your father David walked with integrity of heart.'"

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.469
And twice when speaking of Satan, Jehovah said of Job,

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:29.949
"'There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity.'"

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.950
Of course, the Bible is filled with other examples of men and women who had similar reputations.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.850
We can think of Abraham, Daniel and his three companions,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.890
and all the ones that Paul listed in Hebrews chapter 11, those are just a few,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.689
and of course, the finest example of all is Jesus Christ.

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:56.369
Clearly, Jehovah takes note of, values, and loves people with integrity,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.409
which is a quality that every faithful servant of God needs.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.650
But exactly what is that quality?

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.950
Well, integrity is moral soundness, and unswerving devotion to righteousness.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.829
Having integrity means having strong ethical and moral principles,

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.129
and following those principles at all times.

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:23.790
We could say that such people do the right thing, even when that is not easy,

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.329
and no one is watching.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.829
In fact, integrity is most evident when a person's devotion is under test,

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.829
and he is pressured to abandon the right course.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.829
Now, how does a person develop integrity?

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.569
Well, it all starts with defining one's core values.

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.930
That is, the values that no matter what the consequences,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.269
we are not going to compromise them.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.069
And in this job is an excellent example.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.709
What were his core values?

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.269
Well, we don't have to wonder, turn to Job chapter 1 verse 1.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.209
It says, there was a man in the land of us whose name was Job.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.909
He was an upright man of integrity.

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:14.509
He feared God and shunned what was bad.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.509
Those were Job's core values.

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.870
He had a reverent, deep respect for Jehovah,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.830
and a wholesome dread of disobeying him.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.870
And that was right in line with what Solomon wrote hundreds of years later

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.389
in Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 13, if you'd like to look at that.

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.870
Ecclesiastes 12, 13.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.590
The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard is fear the true God

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.389
and keep his commandments, for this is the whole obligation of man.

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:54.870
Or as a modern paraphrase puts it, fear God, duty tells you.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.909
In the text comments for today, the Watchtower states,

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.509
for servants of Jehovah, the key to integrity is love for God.

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.949
And it adds that along with that must be our loyal devotion to him

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.509
as our Heavenly Father.

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.550
Humans show integrity when they are so completely devoted to God

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.150
that they continue to do his will when facing hardship.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.949
Why even in his worst moment, Job refused to turn against God,

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:30.830
and that is why he said, until I die, I will not renounce my integrity.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.150
Each of us has the responsibility and the privilege, just like Job,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.310
to demonstrate that we serve and obey Jehovah because we love him.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.310
Interestingly, in Job chapter 31, Job lists about a dozen real-life examples

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.310
that if they had been true of him, would have exposed a lack of integrity on his part.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.590
Let's look at just a few of these, and in doing so, it can help us to see what we can do

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.349
to keep our integrity.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.110
Starting with verse 9 of Job 31, he said,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.270
if my heart has been enticed by a woman.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.990
In verse 11, he said, that would be shameful conduct,

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.230
an error deserving judgment by the judges.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.430
We know Job kept himself clean from immorality

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.949
because in verse 1 of that same chapter, he said he had made a covenant

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.470
with his eyes not to show improper attention to another woman.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.629
So he not only avoided committing adultery,

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:38.029
but he had not even taken the first step toward that sin by looking lustfully at other women.

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:46.350
So people of integrity, a polled Jehovah's standard of morality, and the sanctity of marriage.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.829
Another example is in verse 16, he said,

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:52.750
if I refuse to give the poor what they desired.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.189
And in verse 17, he included the need to share his food with the orphans.

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:01.149
Well, we know Job was generous to the poor in needy

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:05.230
because at Job 2912, he said he would rescue the poor,

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.310
the fatherless child, and anyone who had no helper.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.709
So people of integrity value others and help those who are in need,

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:17.470
and they look after orphans and widows.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.069
Another example, verse 24, he said, if I put my confidence in gold,

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:29.230
Job was wealthy at the start, but he was not greedily materialistic.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.509
And when he lost all his wealth, he accepted the fact that as he said,

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.910
naked, he came out of his mother's womb, and naked, he would return.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.990
So people of integrity did not put their trust in material things.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.870
They put the kingdom first in their life.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.389
One more example, verse 33, he said,

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.790
Have I ever tried to cover over my transgressions?

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:01.310
In Job 1323, Job asked for his sins and transgressions to be revealed.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:08.269
And in the end, he accepted reproof for his being too quick to declare himself righteous.

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:12.350
And after Elihu and Jehovah both chastened Job,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.470
he repented in dust and ashes.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.910
So people of integrity are quick to own up to their own mistakes and accept correction.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.509
Surely Job was a model of integrity.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:31.149
Did you know that he requested that a written record be made of his suffering and endurance?

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.750
He did, if you turn to Job chapter 19,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:42.839
Job 19, starting with verse 23, he said,

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:47.800
If only my words were written down, if only they could be inscribed in a book,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.120
all that they were carved forever in the rock with an iron stylus and lead.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.600
How thankful we are that Job agreed to make a permanent record of Job's integrity

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:07.720
keeping course and that he put it in the Bible and did not have it chiseled on some rock

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.360
in the middle of Arabia where Job lived.

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:14.759
Can you sum up the story of Job in one sentence?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.240
Well, one Bible commentary does quite well by stating,

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:26.519
the beauty of the book of Job is of a living, breathing soul encompassed by sorrows,

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:35.160
surrounded by misunderstanding, but unconquered, humbled, and finally satisfied in God.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.079
Through Job's life, we learn that no matter what trials we may encounter,

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:48.519
having a close relationship with Jehovah and staying true to our core values will enable us to

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:55.319
maintain our integrity and that when we are tested, God will support us just as He did Job.

00:07:56.439 --> 00:08:03.560
Psalm 8411 says, Jehovah will not hold back anything good from those walking in integrity.

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:11.319
When we show our complete wholehearted devotion to God by obeying Him and doing what is right in His eyes

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:16.759
in our everyday lives, even when facing hardships, we will surely make Jehovah happy

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:22.600
and frustrate His enemy Satan just as Job did so long ago.
