00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.030
I have very low vision in comparison to the average person.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.989
It often is very painful to get through the day because of the extreme

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.269
light sensitivity and the deterioration of health of my eye.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.429
Jehovah gives me the knowledge that I cannot expect this to go away.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.590
But he never lets me forget that we're always in it together.

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:49.950
Jehovah does not see a disability in me, but he sees someone who is capable of bringing

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.469
place to him, someone who is also capable of helping others.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:02.640
In the world in which we live, people that are disadvantaged feel like that they're not useful.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.200
But here Jehovah has allowed someone who is unable to see, to be able to be equipped to help

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.079
other individuals using his word.

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:25.069
Like so many of us, Rachel, Wayne and Tabo appreciate the hard work of the faithful and

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.909
discrete slave to provide the spiritual food we all need.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:36.189
Technologies used by those who are blind and visually impaired keep advancing.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.069
Under the direction of the writing committee of the governing body,

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:49.709
our organization uses these advances to make life-saving spiritual food more available in formats

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:57.549
the blind can use. In this report, we will briefly look at the history of publications for the

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.870
blind as well as new tools that are very helpful for our blind brothers and sisters

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.310
and those they read in the field. But first, let us consider what the difference is between

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:20.509
being visually impaired and being blind. Those who are visually impaired can see to a limited

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:26.909
degree and may be able to function outside their home without the use of a cane or a guide.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.509
Those who are visually impaired may be able to read by using a large sprint publication or

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:44.270
increasing the text size of an electronic device. However, those who are blind are not able to see

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.110
well enough to function outside their home without the use of a cane or a guide. They may be

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.830
totally blind or they may be able to detect only shadows or very bright light.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:12.189
An estimated 43 million people worldwide are blind. That includes more than 13,000 of our dear

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.990
brothers and sisters. Many more of our brothers and sisters are among the hundreds of millions

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:27.150
who are considered to be visually impaired. What is our history of providing for their spiritual

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:35.300
needs? Printing was first done on a manually operated machine that embossed one sheet at a time.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.659
Over time, the equipment improved. This made it easier to produce complete watchtowers,

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:51.379
books, booklets and tracks. In 1988, we produced the first edition of the New Rail translation of

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.740
the Holy Scriptures in English Braille. When I first started applying here,

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:06.099
there was no Braille Bible. To be honest with you, it was an unexpected gift to be able to

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:14.979
have it, to read it at my disposal whenever I want to, and also to be able to uplift and encourage

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:26.990
others. Today, our organisation prints Braille in 48 languages. In addition, we are also helping

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.949
those who are blind but who cannot read or write Braille. A few years ago, we published the

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:42.829
brochure Learn to Read Braille. It has already been produced in 10 languages and more languages

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:50.189
will be coming. In recent years, new tools have given blind and visually impaired readers more

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:59.089
options for reading and studying the Bible. Starting in 2009, the Watchtower was produced as an

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:05.250
electronic Braille file. Since 2014, we have been making these files available on our website.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.250
These files can be downloaded on a Braille computer called a Notaker that shows the reader

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.290
the Braille dots per line. Well, let's say if we want to take Enjoy Life Forever, it's 12

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.089
volumes to be able to have the whole publication. Now, you have it on a little machine. It's very

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:29.889
nice because you can take your electronic device with you then wherever you need to go.

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:36.370
A screen reader is a digital program you can install on an electronic device or computer.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.610
It can read aloud what is on the screen, helping the user understand and even navigate the page

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.769
of site. A feature that has received a lot of positive feedback is the use of alt text,

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:55.089
short for alternative text. These are more extensive descriptions of the pictures in our publications.

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:02.209
Page 16 Image. A sister and her young daughter washing clothes by hand. A brother and his wife

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:09.329
The first time I encountered picture descriptions, it was so nice. I felt really a part of the

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:16.449
congregation. I can confidently comment on the picture and the feedback that I've always

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:22.529
got from the brothers and sisters is that the descriptions bring out the points that they

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:30.769
didn't even realize with their eyes. And hearing such comments from them always gives me a joy

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:39.540
that I miss us of encouragement to them. Braille and screen readers have been a spiritual

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:48.500
lifeline for these brothers and sisters. But today, we receive so much spiritual food through

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.540
videos. So what's being done to make sure that the blind and visually impaired have access to

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:05.420
videos as well. In 2020, at the Regional Convention, we provided the first videos with audio

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:12.699
descriptions, which are spoken phrases added to a video to explain what's seen on the screen.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.420
Let us just put ourselves in the shoes of a blind person to see the difference audio descriptions

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:38.139
can make. Night time in the King's bedroom, when blows the curtains, he stirs in his sleep,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:52.240
flashes of himself crownless, an immense bright image, a fireball crushes the feet.

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:03.120
I felt like the faithful and the sweet slave was saying to me, we are going to give you one

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.680
less thing that you have to fight for to understand and figure out on your own.

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:16.180
I'm getting the teaching point now. Now the person sitting next to you doesn't have to

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:23.939
describe to you what's going on. You're independent again. I love audio descriptions.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.500
Nowadays, it's a bit difficult for me to watch a video that does not have descriptions.

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:37.539
It also helps when it comes to sharing with the other person the lesson that I have learned

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:50.129
from that video. Jehovah loves me and he compensates my absence of sight with something that he knows

00:08:50.129 --> 00:09:00.049
I can truly benefit from. Today, we are producing videos with audio descriptions in 92 languages.

00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:07.970
These descriptions have proved very useful and they have had another unexpected benefit.

00:09:08.929 --> 00:09:15.649
What is it? Although originally prepared for the blind, we discovered that brothers and sisters

00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:23.009
who cannot afford to download the video format of the convention program are benefiting as well.

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:29.330
They listen to the audio descriptions and these descriptions give them a clear understanding

00:09:29.409 --> 00:09:37.740
of the scenes in our videos. At Psalm 23, David wrote,

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:47.820
Jehovah is my shepherd. I will lack nothing. Like David, we all feel that Jehovah as a loving shepherd,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:54.940
guides and protects us. We feel that especially when we can read the Bible and apply its lessons

00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:03.179
using spiritual food in print, audio and video. Through his organization,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:10.220
Jehovah ensures that all of us, including those who are blind and visually impaired, can

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:17.820
confidently say, I will lack nothing.
