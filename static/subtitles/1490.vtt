WEBVTT

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:27.760
My mother always said Jehovah did nine and ten for all of us to look alike and those early days

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.960
We would work every house and the county like families white families any color

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.159
That school

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.240
That was pressure there being involved with the racial activity

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.359
We would hear about the problems and the issues

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.200
It would be in the news and you would know what was going on in the South

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:01.079
Some may wonder how is it that our people

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.200
That is Jehovah's Witnesses black and white

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:12.519
Could maintain such unity when the world around them was falling apart

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:18.920
grew up in central New York, Utica, New York. I remember in the King of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.239
Ministry back in 1956 there were articles about serving where the need is great

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:33.659
They needed some of the black friends to serve in the South. I married my husband Earl McGee

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140
June 2nd, 1956

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.900
When we were married brother T.J. Sullowing gave the talk at

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.459
Hallendale Convention on serving with the need is greater

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.299
He encouraged not only

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.379
Families, but he says new married couples and so we planned for it and he wrote the branch

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.180
We were assigned to Florida and then in 1962 we started in the circuit work and our first circuit was in Alabama

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.180
And it was not integrated

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.419
We served together

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.099
Edna and I did and the pioneer work by assignment the last assignment was by

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.259
The society assigning us to North Carolina and then there to the circuit work after the first circuit

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.180
Which was in the Carolinas and Georgia?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.379
We were assigned to Gilead

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.199
We got married in April 23rd 1949

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.740
I've been full-time service 70 years for a while

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.539
I was assigned to a circuit 18 in Alabama

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:53.300
My first circuit assignment was in Mississippi

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.379
It had the reputation as the worst state in the Union for race relations

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.099
And then after we got there there were three civil rights workers who were killed in

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.780
Philadelphia, Mississippi, that was our circuit

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.259
So those were the things we had to deal with

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.849
We were busy in our ministry, so it didn't bother us very much

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.009
The black work, the black and the white work for white

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.949
So we just obeyed the customary law of staying segregated

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:37.949
Lots of movements were happening and people were, you know, very hostile

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.949
When there was a march or any tension, we were serving there in Alabama

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:48.949
We wouldn't go to the town on Saturday afternoon to do street witnessing

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.949
Because if there was a rally or something going on, we would just stay in the neighborhood

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.949
A lot of what they called back then freedom writers

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.949
People get on buses going south and people coming in to register borders

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.949
In fact, some of the civil rights organizations were set up in Mississippi and were in pretty strong

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:15.949
So as a result, they would think that because we were active in going door to door we could just incorporate

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.949
Civil rights issues and things like that into our work

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:26.949
One of our classmates and the 27th class was a black brother of fellow student

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.949
And we became very close friends there

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.949
After we left Gilead, we were going to our assignments

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.949
We stopped at a convention in Alabama

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.949
And the convention was segregated

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.949
One race on one side, one race on another

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.949
And it was very difficult, painful for us not to be able to

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.949
closely associate with our dear friend

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.949
So we got this talk show on the television

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.949
The circuit overseen I went also a Catholic priest and a Piscopal minister

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.949
So the Piscopal minister, the young minister has what we were doing about the marching

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.949
So I told him that we weren't doing anything about the marching

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.949
Well that's sort of a contrast, I'm black and these white

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.949
They were stopping their marching to help us priesthood into the kingdoms

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.949
So we weren't going to stop preaching good news into the kingdom to help them march

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.949
The brothers always were interested in each other

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.949
So if there was a black congregation and a white congregation

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.949
We had interest and fellow feeling for both

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.949
The rule was we were not to meet together

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.949
And we couldn't meet together, but we could talk to one another and we could visit one another

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.949
So I think there was great support on both sides

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.949
Black and white brothers back in those days

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.949
If we had a problem getting a facility for example

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.949
They'd have contacts and they could get certain things done

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.949
So basically we worked together

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:08.300
The congregation started integrating after certain civil rights laws

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.300
Repairs

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.300
We had a big meeting of all the elders and worked out the territory assignments

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.300
And whatever else was necessary to have integrated congregations

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.300
Some friends would feel and maybe rightly so at the time

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.300
That there would be some violence if we integrated

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.300
There probably was some kingdom always damage and things like that as a result

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.300
But the fact is there was integration going in other places in the schools

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.300
And things like that in the universities and colleges

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.300
And so it was obvious that if they could do it then we even more so

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:59.300
The process of integration was successful because it was under Jehovah's direction

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.300
Both black and white we had the same thing in common

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.300
We loved Jehovah

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:14.300
And despite us Jehovah got it done for us and brought us together

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.300
And we had been unified ever since

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.300
Everyone could see that we were united

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.300
One brother was working from door to door black and white

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.300
And the lady came to the door white

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.300
And she said she was happy to see this unity take place

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.300
She looked forward to it for a long time

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.300
We have formed with Jehovah's help by means of his Holy Spirit

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.300
A worldwide brotherhood granted they have their imperfections

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:57.540
But it is a brotherhood and something to be truly marveled at

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.540
The brothers began to feel what we knew was true

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.540
We were all one organization that began to feel it being to experience it

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:14.540
We loved Jehovah and we loved our brothers

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:24.889
So there you have it, how could you fail to have unity when Jehovah had drawn you together

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:28.889
Satan is the prime one to divide people

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:32.889
Jesus died for the whole world of mankind

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:35.889
So who would that exclude?

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:37.889
No one
