00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:11.230
While it's important that we care for our own spirituality and that of our family, our ministry revolves heavily around helping other people.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.230
For a few minutes, I'd like to address the theme, helping people of all language groups.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.230
Do you feel the urgency of the times in which we are now living?

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.230
What a privilege we have to be serving God in these last days.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.230
At a time when Jehovah is speeding up the kingdom preaching work,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.229
we are seeing the fulfillment of the words recorded in Isaiah, chapter 60, verse 22.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:44.229
Let's read that scripture together, Isaiah, chapter 60, and verse 22.

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.229
There, Jehovah tells us,

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.229
the little one will become a thousand,

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.229
and the small one are mighty nation.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.229
I myself Jehovah will speed it up in its own time.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.670
No matter where we look in the earthly part of Jehovah's organization,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.670
we see the things are progressing at an amazing rate.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.670
The preaching work is penetrating more places.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.670
The Theocratic schools are helping thousands,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.670
and the construction work Earthwide is growing.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.670
There are so many exciting developments that we could discuss.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.670
But I'd like to discuss with you something that's very close to my heart.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.670
It's another aspect of our work that has seen some amazing increases,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.670
namely the translation work that has been accomplished by Jehovah's people.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.980
Just a few decades ago,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.980
we were producing Bible literature in a little over 200 languages.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.980
But that figure has now risen to well over 700 languages,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.980
and the number continues to increase every week.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.980
Why, just last service year alone,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.980
approval was given to start translating into 88 new languages.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.979
Even more amazing is the fact that some 700 languages

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.979
are available on our JW.org website,

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:19.979
either as a site language or as publications that can be downloaded free of charge.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:24.979
But why is it necessary to do all this translation work?

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:30.979
Is it so that we can become known as the organization that produces literature

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.979
in the most number of languages?

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:39.979
No. We aren't engaged in an academic exercise or some competition.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:44.979
Rather, we desire to work in harmony with Jehovah's will.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.979
And what is Jehovah's will concerning this matter?

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:53.979
The answer to that question is found in the inspired words of the Apostle Paul,

00:02:53.979 --> 00:03:00.979
as recorded in 1 Timothy, chapter 2, and verses 3 and 4.

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:06.979
That's 1 Timothy, chapter 2, verses 3 and 4.

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:11.979
This is fine and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God,

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:15.979
whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.979
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:25.979
The fact is that all sorts of people speak all sorts of languages,

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:30.979
clearly than Jehovah wants everyone to hear the kind of message in their own language

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:36.979
so that they can be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.979
To illustrate what is involved in accomplishing this work,

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.979
imagine this scenario.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.979
You are assigned to preach in an area where people speak a language

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.979
that doesn't have any literature at all.

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:56.979
Perhaps you've tried to learn that language and you start preaching to them

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.979
before long many show an interest in the truth.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:05.979
But how can you study with them as they have no literature in their language?

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.979
Well, they may have a Bible in their language,

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.979
so you might be able to teach them by just using that Bible.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:17.980
But could they prepare ahead of time for the study

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.980
and how could they do personal Bible study?

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.980
Eventually, they start coming to the meetings.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.980
But what songs can they sing?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.980
What material could they discuss and how could they prepare for the meetings?

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.980
If they don't understand basic Bible truths, how could they prepare for baptism?

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.980
It wouldn't take long for you to realize that these people need literature in their own language.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.980
It's not enough for them to attend meetings held in a language they don't understand.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:05:00.980
Regarding Christian meetings, the Apostle Paul wrote the words recorded in 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 9.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.980
1 Corinthians 14 verse 9.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.980
In the same way, unless you with the tongue use speech that is easily understood,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.980
how will anyone know what is being said?

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.980
You will, in fact, be speaking into the air.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.980
Well, none of us want to do that.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:28.980
That's why the governing body continues to approve the translation of our literature into more and more languages,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.980
so as to fill the spiritual needs of those who speak these languages

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.980
and to help them to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.980
It's true that many of those who speak these languages already know another more common language,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.980
to be able to converse with others.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:54.980
So why go to all the trouble of translating the Bible's message into these less common languages?

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.980
It's because we try to reach these persons in the language of their heart.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.980
To have a God Himself set the example by what He did on the day of Pentecost in the year 33CE.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.980
You might remember that He miraculously enabled the crowds of visitors there in Jerusalem to hear the message

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:22.980
not just in the major languages they may have known, but also in their own native languages

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.980
or the languages of their birth.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.980
This reminds me of an experience I heard while visiting some islands in the South Pacific.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:39.980
The brothers there told me about a man who had learned the truth in a language that was not his own native tongue.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:47.980
But recently he had had an opportunity to hear the truth in his own language, the language of his birth.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.980
What was his reaction?

00:06:50.980 --> 00:07:00.980
He said, before I could only smell the spiritual food, but now I can really taste it and enjoy it.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:07.980
How it strengthens our faith to know that our loving Heavenly Father desires that all sorts of persons

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.980
have an opportunity to hear the truth about Him.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:18.980
And what a privilege we have to be associated with an organization that is helping people of all language groups

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.980
large and small to do exactly that.
