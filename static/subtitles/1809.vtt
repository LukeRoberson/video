00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.000
Now I'd like to introduce to you two of my close friends, Peter and Sue Schultz.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.400
Like me, they're originally from Australia and now we work together at Brooklyn at the

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.880
World Headquarters.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.719
Peter, as you realize, we've been talking about the matter of keeping and maintaining

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.719
a positive attitude.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:27.839
I know that quite a number of years ago, you and Sue and other members of your congregation

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.039
went through a traumatic experience.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.159
Would you mind just briefly telling us a little bit about it?

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.159
Yes, Jeff.

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:40.600
We have to go back to Sunday, July 21, 1985.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.759
Our congregation was meeting that morning for the public talk in Sydney, Australia.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.600
And during the public talk, there was a massive explosion in the Kingdom Hall.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.240
We learned later that a bomber had been placed underneath the platform and it went off

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:07.079
just a few feet from where the speaker was standing, unbelievably he survived.

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:12.159
But when the police arrived and to their credit, they got there very quickly, they expected

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.200
to find a Kingdom Hall full of dead bodies.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.120
But there was only the one death, a brother and very dear friend who was sitting with

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.040
his family just on our left.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.239
When Dustin and Debris had settled sufficiently, I actually was looking for my wife.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.239
She disappeared.

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:41.159
And then I saw her boot sticking out from underneath a large ceiling bat that had fallen to the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.640
floor.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.040
And so I put it aside and was shocked when I looked at her face.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.079
Obviously, something very solid had hit her square in the middle of this area of the

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.640
face and knocked her in her chair over backwards.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.719
So this whole area was very badly damaged.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.680
Her upper lip was severed right across and it was hanging down on her chin.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.560
And there was a gouge of flesh taken out of her left biceps.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.000
On the positive side, I was reassured to see that there wasn't much bleeding.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.919
And I learned later that I was mistaken.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.840
She actually bled heavily down into a stomach.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.039
So I ended up being taken to a trauma center in one hospital in Sydney and Peter was sent

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:36.520
to another hospital and he had to stay overnight because doctors had to operate on his arm.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.719
Of course, the very next morning I was eager to get to Sue.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.960
So the hospital released me that morning and I went over to the hospital where Susie

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.639
was staying.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:55.400
And when I found her, Jeff, I wouldn't have recognised her face and swollen up like a

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.879
mellum.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.759
Even her eyelashes, not just her eyes, but her eyelashes were buried in swollen tissue

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:07.159
where her eyes should be, were just two lines across her face.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.680
Of course, she couldn't see a thing which I, again, as she went under the circumstances,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.680
might have been a blessing.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680
What's good?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.680
Well, just from what you inferred there, wondering was there an issue with the blood,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.680
but you mentioned it was bleeding?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.680
Yes, the blood issue came up immediately when they realised that there was a lot of bleeding.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.680
Whatever it hit me, artery behind the nose had either burst or been punctured.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.680
We're not sure which.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.400
And so the blood was running down into my stomach all that time.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.439
So of course, the hemoglobin dropped right down.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.080
It was about six.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.840
So the surgeon that was assigned to me, he said, well, yes, he would do the operation

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.360
to get the bones reset and all that, but only if I would give him the option to use blood.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.319
So that was, we tried to reason with him for many days, Peter especially had quite a

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:12.560
few sessions with him, but it ended up, he finally said, I'm not doing the operation.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.800
So at that time, it was about now 10 or 11 days and for me, it was becoming critical for

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.600
the face, even though all the stitching was done immediately and that was healing up nicely.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.720
But the bones were in the wrong places and now they were starting to set.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.480
You know, they needed to be put back in place.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.519
So at that time, I think there were no hospital liaison, or no hospital liaison arrangement.

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:39.879
Peter and I felt like a couple of little duckies trying to go through uncharted waters.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:45.199
We just didn't know literally where to put our foot next, which door to knock on next.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.920
It was stressful, wasn't it, love that?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:54.160
Yes, it was like we were walking toward a huge brick wall with no way around, no way to

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.279
get past this thing.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:05:02.279
And we begged over what do we do, how do we deal with this situation, because we had no

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.279
idea.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:10.240
Anyway, just as, and knows as about to hit the wall, so to speak, a door opened, a brother

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.759
who was a general practitioner, had got in touch with a plastic surgeon who said, he

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.600
take a look at Sue and he did.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.279
Yes, completely different attitude.

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:26.720
He said, yes, I'm prepared to do this, but I'll use a different procedure.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.319
And he felt that procedure, he would not even, you know, blood wouldn't even be an issue.

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:37.240
But he did say, I want to make sure your hemoglobin must be nine before I'm prepared to do

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.240
this.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.160
Well, for many days already, we had been working on getting, you know, my blood up or

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.040
my blood in better condition because we were trying to cooperate with the hospital staff

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.720
and the previous doctor as much as we could.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.600
So dear friends, at Bethel, each day they were using vegetable juices, full of iron, and

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.959
every night bringing them up.

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:02.480
And we'd hear the bottles rattling down the corridor, wouldn't we, Pete?

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.199
And we'd say he comes to jungle juice.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.360
So down the straw it went.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.800
And when I had the blood test, the hemoglobin was already, it had already gone through

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800
nine.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.800
We were very happy.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.160
So the surgeon went ahead and wiped up my jaw and put the frame, the little scaffolding

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.639
on, and I was good to get healed.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.120
Well, we're so happy that that was successful.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.639
But does that mean you haven't had any other problems afterwards?

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.120
Well, like a car that's been dinged, there's a few rattles right.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.160
So my sense of smell couldn't be restored.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.959
I had to have eardrum graphs.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.680
I wish they would grow back.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.160
I said, Peter's grew back, and I said, how come yours grew back?

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.120
But anyway, I had them surgery put in.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.000
Severe headaches were the problem I found for many years after the bomb.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.920
But I think one of the things that wears on your nerves the most, and I'm sure a lot of

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.839
the brothers and sisters who went through the bombing, either experienced it or even

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:12.920
still do, and that's the tinnitus, the constant ringing buzzing in your ears.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.759
And that hasn't stopped since the bombing.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:20.240
So in the new system, we'll be the ones sitting out in the paddock, listening to silence.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.000
Well, thanks for explaining all that.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.759
But now, Peter, you mentioned, too, that beyond the physical problems that you were dealing

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.000
with, there were some other issues you had to handle.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.480
Yes.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.399
I guess you could say we both suffered from what I assume was post-traumatic stress, and

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:47.199
nerves had taken a real beating, and we were both emotionally exhausted from the whole

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:54.879
ordeal, seeing a dear brother and friend killed, just feet away from us, seeing the congregation

00:07:54.879 --> 00:08:02.759
suffering, seeing what Susie went through, that really took its toll on both of us.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:12.199
And just to illustrate, Sue, for years had difficulty sleeping, and I had difficulty, too,

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:18.279
but Susie even more so, and she began to suffer from panic attacks.

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:23.920
She was always very relaxed on the platform, even at large gatherings, but now she couldn't

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.279
finish reading the text comments at the Field Service Group without running out of breath.

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:34.399
In those days, that was the custom, so I or another brother had to finish the reading.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.399
Yes.

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:39.399
Peter got used to me going, you finished.

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:44.120
Well, our hearts go out to you, it must have been a very difficult time.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.799
There was also, you said, a question you had to grapple with in your mind.

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:55.559
Yeah, sometimes, you know, people would say, why would you hover a lair, such an atrocity

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:59.399
to be perpetrated against a congregation of his people?

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:05.000
Well, it's not a bad question, it's one that we need to answer, and how will you

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.159
be able to work your way through that?

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:13.200
Well, Susie and I often tried to remind ourselves, any impressive on our heart, that there

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.480
are bigger issues here than the preservation of our individual human lives.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:24.519
There's Jehovah's sovereignty and his name, and of course, the integrity of his worshipers.

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:27.559
And what are our motives for serving him?

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:32.480
And of course, as we know from the Bible, Jehovah didn't promise that he would shield

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.519
every one of us individually from physical harm.

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:41.919
In fact, Jesus even said that some of his followers would be persecuted and killed.

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:49.360
And besides that, our brothers die from horrible diseases, others are killed or maimed in

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.360
accidents or natural disasters.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.200
That's just life in this old system, isn't it?

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.080
And so, Jehovah helps us, and we found the biggest way in which he helps us is by giving

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.799
us comfort and encouragement, mainly through our dear brothers and sisters.

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:15.679
And Jehovah did that abundantly with us, especially our family and our close friends.

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:19.600
Sue, would you like to just give us a little bit from your side as well?

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.600
Yes, there was an absolute outpouring of support.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.000
Some of our family traveled from the other side of the country, and they were with us

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.639
for the first couple of weeks right there in the hospital.

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:32.759
That was a real comfort.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:38.799
And our spiritual family, brothers and sisters, there were bouquets of flowers coming into

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:39.799
the hospital.

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:44.840
There seemed to be an endless stream of cards and letters, some from brothers and sisters

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.279
in other countries.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:51.360
And you know, it was such a lovely weakness because quite a few of the nursing staff would

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360
comment on all this.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.919
And they said, do you know all these people?

00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:58.519
So we'd say, well, we don't know them, but they're our spiritual family, our brothers

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.519
and sisters.

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.120
It was funny with the flowers.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.919
You remember Peter was valiantly doing his man's job of caring for these flowers, trying

00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:07.919
to water them.

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:13.039
The bed was like a botanic garden, serenade of our flowers.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:18.000
So pits are watering them, and one day I heard the nurse say to him, Peter, I think you'll

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.639
find that those flowers are watering a silk, so we had a good laugh, but he was doing good.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:24.720
That's probably what we're going to have him work in the garden in the vessel.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.200
That's what it is.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.919
But you know, with the cards, the words, the well chosen words that brothers and sisters

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:39.080
wrote on those cards, they touched our hearts.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.519
And it was like, you know, they used the expression of warm blanket put over you.

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:47.720
It was like they were right there in that hospital ward with us saying, we're right there with

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720
you.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.840
We're right behind you.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.679
And that was a tremendous comfort.

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:58.559
But then sometimes you get, you know, the down days where you just feel totally depressed

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:01.279
and you're at the end of your tether.

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:04.399
And the spiritual food is so essential.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:07.919
And that's what your home provides, it just gets you right out of yourself.

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:09.919
And so, okay, focus again.

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:15.679
I remember vividly one day Peter brought it, it was one of those down days.

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:19.840
And he had brought up the latest watchtower from Bethel.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.600
And it had an article in it that he read to me about one of our precious brothers in Africa.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.200
He had endured brutal physical persecution.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.879
And when Peter finished the article, just thinking of that brother's integrity under

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:41.600
those circumstances, his loyalty to Jehovah, you know, it stops you focusing on yourself.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.159
You say, look, stop focusing on yourself.

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:46.360
Look at what others are going through.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.360
It inspires you.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.879
You say, I want to be just like that.

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:52.480
I just printed out the last little part of that article.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.480
Can I share it?

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.480
Please, we'd love to hear it.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.159
This is how the article finished.

00:12:58.159 --> 00:13:03.440
What helped this loyal supporter of God's kingdom to endure brutal treatment?

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.240
For three months, he was entirely on his own.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.799
He fully expected to die.

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:15.559
And yet, when asked how he felt during this ordeal, his answer was, I felt that Jehovah

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:17.799
was with me all the time.

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:23.879
There were no complaints against his persecutors or lamenting over what had happened to him,

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:28.360
just firm conviction that Jehovah never forsakes his loyal servants.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.360
Isn't that great?

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.360
That's beautiful.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.360
That's beautiful.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.919
Now, I don't want to embarrass you both, but those of us who work with you view you both

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:44.120
as excellent examples of those that have a positive spirit, a positive attitude.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.799
Just how can you keep a positive attitude when you've been through such a horrific, traumatic

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:49.799
event?

00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:51.559
Yes, that's a good question.

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:57.440
I can honestly say, Jeff, that if Susie and I were to stew over the horrible thing that

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.320
happened to our congregation, it would be very easy to do.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.799
To become bitter or even depressed.

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:09.639
But as Jehovah's people, we have so much going for us.

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:11.559
We have so much help.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.279
We've got Jehovah's Word.

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:15.600
We've got Holy Spirit.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:21.679
We've got a wonderful hope for the future, and we've got loving brothers and sisters.

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:28.559
And we found that when you take full advantage of those precious gifts, then Jehovah strengthens

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:31.840
and comforts you and he helps you.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:38.399
And I've seen that with Sue because when we go through trials and we take advantage of

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:43.279
those gifts, the trials actually mold us and refine us.

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.600
They don't harden us.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.840
Many in the congregation, we've both seen, have been refined and molded by this experience.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.240
And I've seen it with Sue.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.320
I can honestly say that she's a more compassionate and understanding person as a result of what

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320
she's been through.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.480
She didn't want me to say that, but I said it anyway.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.159
I'm sure she'll forgive you.

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:09.559
And Sue?

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:13.120
Yes, we have tried to focus ahead.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:19.399
And the reason is Jehovah tells us this is not the real life in his Word.

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:21.879
And Peter and I firmly believe that.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:23.679
The real life is ahead.

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:30.159
And anything that happens to any of us in this old system, Jehovah can undo it 110% in

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.399
the new world.

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:38.480
So we're tried to leave things in Jehovah's hands as to how it works out and just focus

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.080
on what's coming up.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.440
And in that way, we've been able to put the bombing behind us and get on with life.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.440
Yeah, that has helped to give us an inner peace.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.120
But Jehovah's hands are much bigger and much stronger than ours.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.799
Well, those are some beautiful expressions.

00:15:56.799 --> 00:16:04.159
And thank you both for being willing to express how you felt about those circumstances.

00:16:04.159 --> 00:16:08.320
If you'd like to read the full account of their experience, it was published in the

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.639
awake magazine of January 8, 1992.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:18.279
It's true that very few of us have had things like that happen to us.

00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:23.360
But many of us have had to face a test while dealing with serious health problems.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.639
Additionally, many different traumatic events can cause us to experience a form of post-traumatic

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:30.440
stress.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.120
Hasn't this interview shown us that even though someone's experience may be different

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:41.000
from ours, we can still learn some valuable lessons from listening to their stories.
