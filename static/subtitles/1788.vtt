00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:09.230
We came across an archive video of another faithful brother who endured four and a half years in prison in China.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.309
This is an interview from the past with brother Harold King.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.309
I saw a policeman coming into the lane and they were as if they were facing a machine gun attack or something.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:29.309
They were creeping along the wall on the other side and running up into the lane.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.310
And so I said, Stanley, someone's going to get picked up this morning.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.310
Look at the police are in the lane because we've been seeing this quite often.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.310
They were picking up people all over the city.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:52.310
So what we did, we were just going to get on with our breakfast anyway when bang, bang, bang on our back door.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.310
And I said, Stanley, it's us. They're after us this morning.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:03.310
But we couldn't. They couldn't find anything. They did take the files because we'd hidden nothing.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.310
And the thing is we didn't have to worry too much because they had to spy in the congregation.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.310
They gave them all the information they wanted before they came and arrested us.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.310
That fellow was originally my Bible study when he was a university student.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.310
I thought what a dirty little rotter that fellow has turned out to be.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.310
And I looked straight at his face and he wouldn't look at mine. He hung his head.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.310
The magistrate says, what? Do you know this man?

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.310
And he said, yes, he was my teacher. What did he teach you?

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.310
He taught me that the Chinese people's government was of the devil and that it was going to be destroyed

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.310
and all who supported would be destroyed along with it.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.310
He said to me, is that what you taught him? I said, well, I'd like to qualify that.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.310
I sat there on the floor. I had no bed. I had no chair. I'd only got a concrete floor.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.310
I'd got a room four and a half by nine. And all it was in the corner was a bucket like that.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.310
I wouldn't bucket it that with the bands around it. That was my restroom.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.310
And the situation was full of, the cell was full of ermine.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.310
They got bugs, bed bugs crawling in there and I was bitten all over.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.310
I hadn't had any food since that breakfast and here it was now.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.310
I wasn't going to get any of that night.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.310
I used my time in the cell. I wasn't going to sit there on the floor full of self-pity.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.310
I was going to go preaching. If they wouldn't let me do anything, I could do something.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.310
I could practice my presentations. So each corner of the cell became a door.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.310
And I would start off and go to this door and witness.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.310
And I made it quite real from experiences that I had.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.310
Not every corner was interested. This one was very interested and this one turned out to be a return visit

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.310
and a Bible study. And I got a Bible study going, I didn't turn in the field service report,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.310
but it kept my mind on the scriptures.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.310
And I had no other way of doing that. I could have compromised.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.310
They told me, you see, they wouldn't let me cut my hair.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.310
They wouldn't let me shave. They wouldn't let me pair my nails.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.310
And I couldn't get proper exercise.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.310
And they kept saying, if you will only confess to your spies, no, I would, that would be betrayal.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.310
And that was the last thing I wanted to do. I had lovely relationship with Jehovah God.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.310
I loved him very dearly. He was real. He wasn't fictitious.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.310
And the whole organization, the angels, and all the fine work of Paul, James, Peter, John,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.310
the earnestness of which they kept the work going, it was my privilege to do that now.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.310
And they were my examples and I followed them.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.310
So never at any time did I think of trying to find an easy way out.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:26.939
Well, I prayed to Jehovah then and I said, Jehovah, I want to be able to celebrate the memorial with my brothers outside.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:33.939
So could I see the moon on that night?

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:39.939
And if it wasn't the full moon, I don't, don't let me see it.

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.939
Well, there were cloudy nights and there were bright nights.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:49.939
But this particular night on that first nice and 14, there wasn't a question about it.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:53.939
It seemed almost as if Jehovah had polished up that moon.

00:04:53.939 --> 00:05:00.939
And then I gave the memorial talk to an imaginary kingdom awful of brothers.

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:06.939
And I gave it through when I came to the point of passing the emblems.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.939
I would just ask Jehovah's blessing on the bread.

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:16.939
And I'd pick up the saucer and make a pretence of passing it around and bringing it back

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.939
and making a pretence of taking a piece of myself.

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.939
And then I'd put it down and I would ask Jehovah's blessing on the cup

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:30.939
and do the same with my normal mug and then come back and make the pretence of drinking it

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.259
and prayed Jehovah would accept that.

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.259
I don't like the word depress because I never was depressed.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:44.259
But there were days when I felt things could go a little better than they were going.

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:49.259
So I thought something like this.

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:57.259
Oh, come all you slaves of Jehovah on high who've given your heart to your God.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:04.259
Out to the work you've been given to do in the footsteps that Jesus Christ brought.

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.259
And then that song came.

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:13.259
And I used to get that and a very fact of singing that song lifted me up out of the low spell.

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:25.079
I was exalted. I was accelerated in realizing that just across the other side of the bridge

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:32.079
for the British Consulate General with my passport and outside there were a team of brothers

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:35.079
that had come up to meet me from the branch.

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:37.079
And I would be with him again.

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:46.079
I was emotionally almost weeping with the joy of being among them again.

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:52.079
We just got bare hugs all around and they were so happy.

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:59.079
And all the way home they were asking questions how it was and I was able to talk to them.

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:06.079
And by the time I did get down there I was getting a bit horse because I'd been talking.

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:12.079
And I was so sort of warmed up at the time being free again.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:16.079
And I was taking everything in as I went along.

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:21.079
And I realized the beauty of Hong Kong at that time and the work and that was being done there.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:28.329
Faith is based on accurate knowledge.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:35.329
And the only accurate knowledge available regarding the purpose of creation

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:39.329
is that contained in the Bible.

00:07:39.329 --> 00:07:43.329
So it is a case. I would say a new one.

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:50.329
Now I'm telling the brothers everywhere get that Bible off its printed page and get it into your heart.

00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:56.329
And then you've got it. And it's a living word and it will keep you strong in the faith.

00:07:56.329 --> 00:07:58.329
Where else can you go?

00:07:58.329 --> 00:08:02.329
Look at the world of state that it's in today.

00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:09.329
There's no haven anywhere in this world but there's a wonderful haven among your hopeless people.

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:15.779
Brother King endured the persecution.

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:22.779
He was later released and since his death in January of 1993 we are confident.

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:26.779
He is ruling as a king with Jesus in heaven.

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:29.779
Was his endurance worth the sacrifice?

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:31.779
Absolutely.
