00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.289
The stars that fill a summer night

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.769
Looked down from our bow

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.170
The beauty of the day and night

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.570
You fashioned with love

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.090
Your hands prepared the land and sea

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.450
And everything that came to be

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.509
Projoy to your

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.710
And it's joy in your creation

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.109
In the message of salvation

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:55.929
And the paradise to go

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:02.780
But the high is a real and lasting treasure

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:42.250
You were all touch and see

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.650
And feel deep inside

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.129
You gave us such a perfect start

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:52.569
Eternity in every heart

00:01:52.569 --> 00:02:06.219
And joy in the message of salvation

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:19.900
And the passing treasure

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:53.580
You were all aware of our joy

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:06.250
In the message of salvation

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:19.909
And the passing treasure

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.310
You were all...
