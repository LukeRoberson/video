00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.310
My mom always told me, I've always been a caregiver ever since I was a little girl.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.750
It was just part of who I was.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.969
I don't like to see people suffer, it's very difficult for me.

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:29.769
I remember when I first started working as a nurse, I would always cry.

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:37.740
I cried literally, I cried every day that I had to go to work.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:49.740
Not only was I overwhelmed being a new nurse, but also I was bowing my depression.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.539
I was feeling so sad, I really needed Jehovah's help to figure out what was going on with

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.859
me.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:06.379
And I remember the 2009 article about depression came out and I realized, okay Jehovah,

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.060
you're telling me this is what I have.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.819
So now that I realize I have this, I got to figure out how I can manage it.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.819
So I changed my eating habits.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:19.700
I started exercising a lot more.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.420
I realized that exercising and eating healthy really, really did help.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.180
Also I made a journal and I made different sections of the different aspects of my depression

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.980
that I dealt with.

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:44.180
In section, I would put scriptures, I would put articles and the illustrations, the pictures.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.739
They speak, they speak a lot without saying anything.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:02:06.129
Jehovah shares us, Jehovah cares, exercising, changing my diet, the publications, journaling.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.729
That was my lifeline, that really actually helped me for a long time.

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:16.849
But it came to a point where it stopped working as effectively.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.729
I remember getting ready for dress for the meeting and I was fine, getting dressed for

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:28.330
a meeting, about to walk off the door, but I couldn't, there was this overwhelming fear

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.050
that came over me and overwhelming sadness that came over me and I just lost it.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.650
I just started crying, I couldn't get, I couldn't get myself together.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.650
It was bad.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.650
It got really bad.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.430
My depression got really bad.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.990
So it was very difficult for me to approach the brothers to ask them for help.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:04.860
But at that time, I knew that if I didn't, that something bad would happen.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.300
So I decided, you know what, I'm going to ask for a shepherd and call with my brothers

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.900
because I never talked about my depression with the elders at all.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.300
This was my first time speaking with them.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.300
And there was one brother, one of the elders who also battled depression.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:30.449
And he suggested, have you thought about seeking medical help?

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.610
Seeking professional help was something I never wanted to do.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.090
I thought that I didn't need to do it.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.569
Sometimes there comes a point where you need additional help.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.530
And what you're doing is not enough.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.930
In this world, they make you feel like it's a bad thing that depression is a dirty word

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.050
or seeking medical help is something that you don't do.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.169
But I realized also that seeking medical help was part of my being able to worship Jehovah

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.490
effectively.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.610
That's me doing my part.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.050
Not everyone needs to take that step, but for me, this is what I need to do.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:22.839
And I'm glad I did it because the fact that I've never felt this good in my life.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:25.319
At first, I started with one floor.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.160
Then I went to another floor.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.139
And then the whole entire hospital, every floor, had COVID patients.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.180
That was some of the hardest nursing that I've ever done in my life.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.100
And all my years of nursing.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.420
And we lost a lot of good nurses that were right in the trenches with me that were in

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.259
there doing their best.

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.779
We lost a lot of good people.

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:59.459
Even though I was on medication to help me, it still didn't take the depression away.

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:01.660
You're like, what's the point?

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.379
I can't save anyone.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.899
I can't help anyone.

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:09.139
It was devastating.

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.230
It truly, truly was devastating.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:25.110
And at those times, I just cried to Jehovah, talked to Jehovah about how I'm feeling.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.310
And disaster for his peace to help me to deal.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.870
When I'm able to help people who are battling depression, I feel like Jehovah is using

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.430
me in that way.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.750
And it makes me happy that I can be of use to Jehovah.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.949
It's good to feel, it's so nice to feel good again, to feel happy again, to be able to

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:52.949
smile, to be able to take enjoyment in the small things in Jehovah's creation.

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.949
And just be happy that I'm alive.

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.629
So yeah.
