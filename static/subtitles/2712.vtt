00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.580
Our world is filled with breath-taking beauty.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.239
Why did God create the earth in such a special way?

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:22.239
Even from space, it stands alone as wonderfully unique.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:28.539
God created the earth with an abundance of water.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:39.109
He placed it at just the right distance from the sun

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.109
and set its rotation at just the right speed.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:53.659
He gave it a moon to stabilize the earth tilt, contributing to consistent seasons.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:04.219
And he created an amazing variety of living creatures to share the earth with.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:09.219
Why did God put forth so much effort to create this beautiful earth?

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:17.659
Because he wanted to give the first human couple, Adam and Eve, a wonderful home.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.659
As long as they obeyed God, they and their children would live forever

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.659
and expand the paradise garden to cover the entire globe.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.290
This was God's purpose for the earth.
