00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:13.619
Hard working brothers and sisters volunteer to be part of local design

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:19.019
construction groups worldwide. While working on kingdom halls is the aspect of

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.100
their work that most are familiar with, volunteers are also needed for

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.179
working on assembly halls, field residences, and with disaster reconstruction.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.100
There is an ongoing need to upgrade most of our assembly sites in Zambia.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.100
At many of our sites, the brothers and sisters they're sitting on the ground,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.740
and they're exposed to the elements during the assembly program. In the 2023

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.460
service year, we completed 10 projects related to assembly sites. In Nigeria we

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.859
have 23 assembly halls all over the country and you can imagine they are

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:01.460
extensively used. We face two main issues. Heat and also the noise from heavy rain.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.980
So to solve these two issues, we inserted in the design roof panel that are

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.859
insulated, and this really address both issues. To see how our brothers and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:17.739
sisters can now meet and dignified locations, his heart warming. With the new

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:21.340
baptismal pools, they don't have to worry about getting baptized in rivers

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.780
that could be crocodile infested. The construction programs are also an

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.700
opportunity to train the brothers. We took advantage of the renovation of the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.500
assembly hall to invite older brothers, experts in their trades and in good

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.739
health, to pass on their knowledge to the younger ones. And the truth is, there

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:43.980
was a great deal of learning and an interchange of encouragement, which was

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.340
an also reflected in the congregations. For as much as we consider our kingdom

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.060
halls and our assembly halls as a priority in the program, we realize that a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.540
field residence project is always a special one because we are working not on a

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.900
facility that brothers will visit once or twice a week, but that's where

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.979
someone will actually live and sleep and eat. One brother who benefits from a new

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.180
field residence commented that we used to have to travel long distances to

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.020
brothers houses who have electricity because our mudhuts did not have that

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.099
electricity. Now that is a thing of the past. Having a suitable home base is

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.259
invaluable to these hardworking circuit overseers and their wives. It now

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.939
enables them to get the rest that they need and gives them a suitable

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.419
environment for the study and the preparation they need to do in order to

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:38.819
benefit the congregations they're serving. In the past three years, Nigeria has

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.900
been afflicted by flooding quite a few times. So after receiving humanitarian

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.460
assistance through the coordinators' committee, LDC comes into the picture to

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.780
make sure that if there is any reconstruction work that needs to be done, it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.539
will be accomplished. When disaster strike, artyocratic facilities and the

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.580
homes of our brothers are affected, some of these brothers can't rebuild or

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.780
repair their houses by themselves. So the LDC really plays a big role in making

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.060
sure that we get the information needed and we get the right people working on

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.180
some of these projects. Apart from natural disaster, Nigeria has been affected

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.819
by man-made disaster. There has been a lot of community crisis and usually they

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.259
have to flee from their region to a safer location and when they return, sadly

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.780
at times, they find out that their home has been destroyed or completely burned

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.620
down. So that's where LDC, when it is safe, they will grow, evaluate the needs

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.979
and assist with the reconstruction. Right now, we have 25 houses to be rebuilt

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:51.860
and 18 to be repaired. If someone wants to get involved with disaster

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.219
reconstruction in their branch territory, they have to fill in their forms. It

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:03.780
could be the DC50, which allows them to be LDC volunteers or an A19 form where

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.099
they can volunteer to support the credit projects for a couple of months or

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.740
weeks or even an A8 where they can come full-time and support the LDC

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.220
program. Many might say I can only pray, but actually prayer is the best thing

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.519
that they can do. We need Jehovah's blessings on all these projects and we need

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:26.500
Jehovah's blessings on all those that can volunteer that are working on these

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.180
geographic facilities. The construction and renovation work being done today

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.699
is better preparation for the grand renovation and rehabilitation of this

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.060
planet to happen in the future at a time when all will be able to participate.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.529
Looking back at all that's been achieved with this program, I feel good. I feel

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:58.449
happy and good in a spiritual sense. It reminds me a lot of what the Psalmist said in Psalm 127

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.009
that unless Jehovah builds the house, it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.689
So all the glory and honor obviously go to our God.
