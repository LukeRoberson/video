WEBVTT

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.940
Now, my theme is guard against every sort of greed.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.939
Jehovah, lovingly, gave counsel to Jeremiah's secretary, Barrett,

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.940
to stop seeking great things for himself.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.940
Now, what were those great things? Well, we don't know for sure.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.940
Perhaps prominence or material things are both.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.939
But what bad quality was developing in Barrett's heart that Jehovah saw?

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:42.939
Greed. And the insight book defines greed as inordinate or rapacious desire.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:51.939
The dictionary says it's a selfish, excessive desire for more of something such as money than is needed.

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:56.939
So in effect, Jehovah was telling Barrett, stop being greedy.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:00.939
And in extended application, Jehovah tells us the same thing.

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:09.939
Now, echoing Jehovah's counsel to Barrett is what Jesus tells us if you'll open up to Luke 12.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.939
And let's read our theme scripture here.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.939
Luke 12 verse 15.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.939
Seminar counsel from Jesus.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.939
Luke 12 verse 15.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.939
Then he, that is Jesus, said to them.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.939
Keep your eyes open and guard, now notice, against every sort of greed.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:39.939
Because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.939
Now, what makes it a challenge, though, for us to guard against every sort of greed as Jesus counsel?

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.939
Well, our three great enemies.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.939
In fact, let's discuss each of these and how it makes it a challenge.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.939
Now, first, our imperfect flesh.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:04.939
At Genesis 8.21, Jehovah said the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.939
And one form of badness is greed.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.939
This tendency toward greed becomes manifest very early.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:17.939
For example, as we see little toddlers grab things and hold them tightly.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.939
Mine, mine, mine.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.939
See, that greed is starting to manifest, isn't it?

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:30.939
When people look at a little toddler, they may say, what a cute little boy.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.939
Or he has his mother's eyes, his father's nose.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:43.939
But they never invariably say, look at that little toddler, what an unselfish little toddler.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.939
No, it takes a lot of effort, doesn't it?

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.939
To teach that little one to be unselfish like Jehovah.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.939
But now, what about our second great enemy, Satan?

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.939
What was Satan's downfall?

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.939
It was greed.

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:03.939
He allowed greedy desire for something that belonged to Jehovah alone to develop in his heart.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.939
And what was that greed for worship?

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.939
And he wants his downfall to be our downfall.

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.939
He wants to ensnare us in greed.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:20.939
So he tries to magnify, intensify our wrong tendency to be greedy.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.939
And if you think about it, how was Satan able to entrap the perfect woman of Eve?

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.939
He entrapped her in greed.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:35.939
He got her to crave desire what belonged to God alone, see.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:44.939
In effect, he said to her, eating of all the trees of the garden minus one tree is not good enough.

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.939
You should crave that one tree that has not been given to you.

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:58.939
In fact, let me please illustrate how greedy Satan made Adam and Eve, how greedy they were.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.939
I'd like you to imagine that you have guests staying in your home.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.939
And you say, now, I really want you to make yourself at home while you're here.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.939
You take them into the kitchen.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.939
You open the refrigerator, all kinds of food here.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.939
The cabinets, the pantry.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.939
Everything you could imagine that you would want to eat.

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.939
It's yours. Help yourself. Don't even ask.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:25.939
But then you pull out one little drawer.

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.939
And you say, now, I've set aside some items for a later occasion.

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:32.939
Please, it's very important.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.939
Do not eat from this one drawer.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.939
But you'll find other items just like in the drawer, in the pantry, in the cabinets.

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:40.939
You'll have everything you need.

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.939
Now, would that be overly restrictive?

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:46.939
Would that be an unloving arrangement with your guests?

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:48.939
It'd be very generous wouldn't.

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.939
And in effect, that's the arrangement you'll hold the maid without them and Eve.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.939
Now, back to the illustration, if you came into the kitchen and you have found your guest eating

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.939
out of that one drawer, you had not given them.

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.939
You'd be very upset when you, and you'd probably view it as stealing.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.939
And you likely would put the thieves out of your house.

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.939
So that illustrates how Jehovah felt and how Jehovah reacted.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:21.939
But what a protection being content with what was rightfully hers would have been to Eve.

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.939
But now, what about our third great enemy?

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:26.939
The world.

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:34.939
We are relentlessly surrounded by Satan's world and his spirit called the Spirit of the world.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:42.939
We could say that Jehovah breathes Holy Spirit to influence his people to act like him and be unselfish.

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:50.939
But Satan, in effect, exhales the stinky Spirit of the world.

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:54.939
That makes people act like him in being greedy.

00:05:54.939 --> 00:06:02.939
And one way Satan's world promotes greed for material things is by the relentless advertising.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:07.939
See, people are constantly bombarded with advertisements.

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:09.939
For example, here's just an example.

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:16.939
They may bring out a shiny new car, has about 12 coats of wax on it.

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.939
They get all these spotlights shining on it.

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:22.939
They bring in a camera from all different angles.

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:27.939
And about this time, a scantily clothed woman comes strolling out to that automobile.

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:32.939
And you don't even notice it, but there's soft music playing in the background.

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:38.939
As she opens it or gets in, a crescendo is reached in the background music.

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:44.939
You're made to feel you poor poor loser.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:47.939
If you don't have that car, see?

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.939
They don't talk about the heavy payments you're going to have to make.

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.939
How many meetings you're going to have to miss to make those payments.

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.939
You poor loser, if you don't have that car.

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:06.939
And similar advertising methods are used very often in promoting many other gadgets and material things.

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:15.939
So obviously, we have to fight hard against the Spirit of the world so that we don't allow it to nurture greed in our hearts.

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:24.939
In fact, if we're not careful, our love for Jehovah could be squeezed out by love for money and love for material things.

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:33.939
And if this happens, rather than conquering the world as Jesus did, the world will have conquered us.

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:43.939
Now, it admittedly is a great challenge to fight these three great enemies and avoid as Jesus counseled every sort of greed.

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:45.939
But now think of that.

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:50.939
Jesus indicated not just one sort of greed, one kind of greed.

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:55.939
Greed can take on various faces, manifestations, but we're to guard against all of them.

00:07:55.939 --> 00:08:02.939
What would you say is the antidote that can immunize us against the poison of greed?

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:06.939
Well, is it not contentment, see?

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:11.939
For example, one sort of greed, we talked about greed for material things.

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:18.939
Well, contentment will immunize us against this terrible form of greed.

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:23.939
We're familiar with 1 Timothy, chapter 6 and verse 8.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:32.940
So having food and clothing and the footnote adds shelter, we will be content with these things.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.940
So contentment really protects us.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.940
And in effect, that's what Jehovah was telling Barrett.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.940
He was telling him, you have what you need.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.940
Stop storing up great things or seeking great things.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.940
Be content with what you have and do more important things.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.940
And then he gave a powerful reason.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.940
While Barrett should do this, Jehovah told him in Jeremiah 45-5,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.940
for I'm about to bring a calamity on all flesh.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:06.940
So if you get the mastery over this, I will grant you your life as a spoil.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.940
Well, the same applies to us, doesn't it?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.940
Jehovah is soon going to bring a calamity on all flesh,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.940
and so we need to be content with what we really need and seek first, the kingdom.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.940
We're just temporary residents, aren't we?

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.940
That's what 1 Peter 117 says.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.940
Now, here's an illustration about a temporary resident.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.940
I'd like you to imagine we rent a venue for our regional convention.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.940
Now, you may do a few things to make the stay more comfortable in that venue.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.940
For example, you may do thorough cleaning.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.940
You might do some touch-up painting.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.940
You might repair some broken toilets or light fixtures.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.940
But you would never paint and plaster the entire stadium inside and out.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.940
You wouldn't rip up the seats and put all new seating in.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.940
You wouldn't tear out the parking lot, put in a new parking lot.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.940
Because you know, you're just a temporary resident.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.940
You're going to vacate that place after the weekend.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.940
Now, unlike the illustration, we don't know exactly when we're going to vacate.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.940
But we know it soon.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.940
So we keep a simple, we're just temporary residents.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.940
Another sort of greed, greed for prominence, but being content.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.940
With how generous Jehovah has been and giving us so many privileges,

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.940
we'll protect this from this greed.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.940
It would have protected Korah in Moses' time.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.940
Another sort of greed is greedy sexual desire.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:40.940
If we're single or married, being content with what rightfully belongs to us,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:47.940
see what really be a protection, it would have protected David from his sin with Bathsheba.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.940
Or there are other sorts of greed, such as gluttony and drunkenness.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.940
But the antidote for all of these is contentment.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.940
Contentment with what is rightfully ours that Jehovah has given to us.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.940
And if we are successful in guarding against every sort of greed,

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:14.940
then we'll be on hand to enjoy the marvelous time when Jehovah will open his hand

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:20.940
and satisfy every proper desire of every living thing.
