00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:10.980
expect the unexpected. Well, the unexpected has arrived, hasn't it? None of us expected

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.539
that this graduation program would need to be modified and changed as it is. And yet,

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.940
what have you had to do? You've had to accept the unexpected. There's not much you can do.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.399
And we'd like to commend you, students, soon to be graduates of this class of Gilly,

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:38.520
because you have accepted these changes in a fine positive attitude. But it does highlight

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.759
to us, doesn't it, that sometimes it can be disappointing when unexpected things occur?

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:53.380
Now soon you'll be going to your assignments, whether back home or to a new assignment.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.500
Even though doubt, you're going to face some unexpected things as well. And we'd just

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.219
like to discuss one aspect of this theme. If you'd like to take your Bibles and turn

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:16.739
with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 10. Ecclesiastes chapter 10 and verse 7. And here it describes

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:26.079
something that is unexpected. I have seen servants on horseback, but princes walking

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:33.799
on foot, just like servants. What you wouldn't expect to see that, would you? Now, how are

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.700
you going to see that? Well, the watch that made a very interesting comment about this

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:48.219
first, it said, those who have great ability do not always receive the recognition. And

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:58.180
those with less ability sometimes receive more honor. So when you arrive back full of enthusiasm,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.019
you've enjoyed your Gilly training and no doubt you're thinking, I'm a different person.

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:13.539
I've changed. And we hope you have. Maybe you might expect there will be certain privileges

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:22.099
granted to you. And yet, at the same time, you may see that someone you don't expect is

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.979
given those privileges. They may even come up to you and say, I'm so surprised. I'm shocked.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:34.580
They've given me this privilege. And outwardly, you're saying, hmm, but inwardly, you're saying,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.780
I'm shocked too. Because I'm the one who is trying to gilly it. Surely, I should get this

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.740
privilege. But when you think about it, remember, Jehovah is the one who is backing the work. And at

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.659
times, he does the unexpected. And in this case, give someone we don't expect a privilege. And

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.659
think about it for a few moments, when you first came here, we know and remember your introductions.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.460
And quite a number of you made the comment, we received our invitation to Gilly. We were shocked.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.900
We were humbled. We were amazed. Now, moreover, thinking, why were we selected? And maybe some

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.419
of the people in your congregation and branch walks are saying, why were they accepted? You see,

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:33.460
maybe that was an unexpected invitation. But now, here you are about to graduate.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.099
But it's good to remember that sometimes others are surprised about privileges that we're given.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:48.580
So what can help us to accept the unexpected when it comes to others getting privileges?

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.460
Well, let's look at two principles in the scriptures. The first one is in Ecclesiastes chapter 6 and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:07.139
verse 9. Ecclesiastes chapter 6 and verse 9. Better to enjoy what the I see than to wonder

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:16.819
after one's desires. This too is futility, a chasing after the wind. So in other words, be satisfied

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:24.980
with the privileges you do have. Don't be looking for other privileges, just not satisfied with

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.500
what you've already been given. Treasure the privileges you already have. And included, and that is

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.060
the privilege of coming here to Gilly and being trained. Now, the second principle we'd like to

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:49.350
highlight is found in the book of Psalms Psalm 119 verses 31 and 32. I cling to your reminders.

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:57.350
O Jehovah, do not let me be disappointed. I will eagerly pursue the way of your commandments

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:06.949
because you make room for it in my heart. What's the point? Don't be disappointed. Trust in Jehovah,

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:16.310
trust in his arrangement. It could be that Jehovah is saying to you, look, you've already had enough

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:23.990
privileges. You went to Gilead, remember? Now, be happy that I'm letting someone else

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.870
have an unexpected privilege. Well, that can be a test. Another thing that will help us in a

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.870
situation like that is to remember many of the accounts in the scriptures. And one of those

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:44.470
we like to refer to briefly is that of David killing Goliath. Let's think for a few moments.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.990
If you were in his right soldier, just before David offered himself to do this assignment,

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:01.269
who would you have expected to take down this giant Goliath? Well, probably, first of all,

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:06.550
you would have thought about King Saul because after all, he was head and shoulders taller

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.790
than the average person. And he was a man experienced in warfare. So you might have expected,

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:20.149
I think King Saul is the one who will take this on. Or maybe, if you weren't thinking of King Saul,

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:27.430
you might be thinking of his son, Jonathan. Why? Well, remember, Jonathan was a national hero

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:33.990
by this time. There was the case there in McMash, where he and his attendant climbed up and

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:41.029
boldly and bravely appeared before the Philistines. They killed about 20 of them. And that was the

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:48.310
turning point in the battle. So if anyone is going to take on Goliath, probably you would expect

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:56.310
Jonathan would be able to do that. Now, let's just assume that you were thinking maybe the best

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:04.310
way to do this would be with a sling and a stone. So now, who would you expect to actually do this?

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:13.829
Probably, Saul and Jonathan. Why? They were from the tribe of Benjamin. And what do you remember

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:20.310
about the people from Benjamin? They were experts with using the sling. In fact, we had told they

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:27.430
could sling a stone to a headbreath and would not miss. And in fact, in First Chronicles 12-2,

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:34.949
it says that the brothers of Saul were experts with the sling. So not knowing what

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:40.389
Jehovah was going to do, probably each one of us, if we were back then, would have thought surely

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:47.829
it would be King Saul or maybe Jonathan, they're the most qualified. But why wouldn't you have

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:54.550
expected David? Well, for a start, David was just a boy. He wasn't a soldier. He didn't have

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.870
experience in warfare. Yes, he'd killed a lion and a bear, but he really didn't know about

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:08.949
fighting people in a war. Secondly, he wasn't impressive in appearance. In fact, Goliath was shocked

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:16.629
when he saw this young man coming toward him. And thirdly, he wasn't from the tribe of Benjamin.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:23.350
You see, he wasn't one of these famous persons who could use the sling. The watchtower made the

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:29.350
comment that perhaps because David lived near where the tribe of Benjamin was, maybe that's where

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:36.230
he learned how to use the sling. But the bottom line is none of us would have expected that this young

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:45.029
man, David, would have been used. It was an unexpected event. But now let's think for a moment about

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:53.990
how others reacted. How did King Saul react? Well, initially, King Saul was very happy with the fact

00:08:53.990 --> 00:09:01.830
that David killed Goliath. But what happened later, that turned into jealousy, didn't it? Even into

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:09.509
a murderous desire to kill David. But on the other hand, what about Jonathan? You see, Jonathan

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:16.549
perhaps could have been jealous, but he wasn't. He built a strong relationship and friendship with David.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:26.230
So what can we learn from this account? You see, if you come across someone who gets that

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:32.549
ideal privilege, that assignment that you always secretly have wanted and that you actually

00:09:32.549 --> 00:09:44.899
modestly think you deserve, what will you be? A soul or a Jonathan? Yes, brothers and sisters,

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:52.580
let's always remember, Jehovah does the unexpected and sometimes the unexpected is giving someone else

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:59.620
you don't expect a certain privilege. Don't stand in the way of Jehovah when he uses someone else to

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:07.460
glorify his name. Yes, rejoice in the fact that others are used, just like you are being used

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:15.299
in an unexpected way.
