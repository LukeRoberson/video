00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.199
I was in prison for a year and three months for upholding Christian neutrality.

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.199
I was in a cell with all types of hardened criminals.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.199
I was sitting at home.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.199
My whole family had been arrested.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.929
They bent down the villages.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.929
We had to go live in the bush.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.929
That was difficult because we had a baby.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:41.340
The police came in with guns and pointed them at us and handcuffed us.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.340
Searched all our house, took everything away and took us to the detention center.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.340
And that was the beginning of our imprisonment.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.710
I was taken to prison, all alone, scared.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.710
But I trusted in Jehovah that only he could protect me.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.709
During that entire time, what helped me was that I thought that Jehovah God was strengthened me, that he was by my side.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:14.709
Every day, I would review all my scriptures in my mind and go over them.

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:17.709
That was the first thing I did in the day.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:25.709
So, never in any time, although I didn't have a Bible, did I feel any spiritual loss or weakness.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:31.709
During the difficult moments with the baby, we always prayed to Jehovah.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:38.719
I saw Jehovah as my father, as a real person.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.719
It was like I was hearing Jehovah's voice saying to me,

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.719
My daughter, don't worry, I am with you.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.719
So, I never shrugged back. I remained firm.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:58.719
If I had valued myself, my freedom, my health or material gain, more than my relationship with Jehovah,

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.719
I might not have chosen to serve him.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.719
But because I loved Jehovah more than all these things, I was able to choose Jehovah,

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.719
even if that meant that I had to serve time in prison.

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:22.259
Now I can freely serve God, attend religious meetings, and go in the ministry with my family.

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:29.259
I felt that Jehovah's hand was with me, that fear is a pit.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:34.259
The one who gave me so much strength was Jehovah.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:39.259
If you love Jehovah, love has no fear.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.259
Love finishes fear.

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:46.259
And I can only say that my life, despite everything, has been pleasant.

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.259
And I've been so happy.

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:54.259
In fact, there's been so many occasions when it's been positive joy.

00:02:54.259 --> 00:03:00.259
So, I feel that that is because I've always kept Jehovah right in front of my mind.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:09.259
And I'm confident that brothers and sisters that do the same will find Jehovah and bless them, as he's blessed me.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:13.259
The fact that Jehovah will never forget the loyalty we show him,

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:19.259
and the hope of paradise that he has given us, helps me to feel his love, overcome my fear,

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.259
and become determined to serve him loyally forever.
