00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:12.039
Just a few months ago, most of us had probably never even heard the word coronavirus.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:23.719
Now the words coronavirus and COVID-19 have become an all-too-familiar part of our vocabulary.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:30.579
With the world facing this pandemic, every day life from many of us has been disrupted

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.340
in ways we might never have imagined.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.299
And sad to say in just a short time, this disease has taken the lives of thousands.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:50.939
We know you are concerned about the well-being of our brothers and sisters, especially those

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:56.579
living in lands most directly affected by COVID-19.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:06.260
Well, in this report, we'll hear from responsible brothers in Korea, Italy and the United States

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.540
to find out how our brothers and sisters are doing and what steps are being taken to assist

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.819
those facing this serious health crisis.

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:25.540
But before we hear from those brothers, please let me share some thoughts with you.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.620
The spread of this disease is distressing to be sure.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:39.620
But we're really not surprised to see the world in the grip of such pestilence are we?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:49.939
Jesus made it clear at Luke 21-11 that pestilence would be part of the sign of the last days.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:59.859
And in Revelation 6, the right of the fourth horseman includes mention of deadly plague.

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:08.659
So the events unfolding around us are making clear than ever that we're living in the final

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:16.259
part of the last days, undoubtedly the final part of the final part of the last days, shortly

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:26.979
before the last day of the last days. But while the situation is serious, as Jehovah's people,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:37.379
we do not need to panic. And Isaiah 30-15 tells us why. Let's read that together.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.780
Isaiah 30-15, for this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, says,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:58.340
by returning to me and resting, you will be saved. Your strength will be in keeping calm

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:09.580
and showing trust. Jehovah has always guided and supported his people in times of distress.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:20.539
So we have good reason to do just as this first tells us. Keep calm and show trust in Jehovah.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.699
And in turn, Jehovah will give a strength. As we'll see in these reports from around the world,

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:36.860
Jehovah has given us Bible principles to help his people make wise decisions, even in very

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:45.419
difficult circumstances. Let's begin by speaking with Brother Reno Kask, who serves in Korea.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:51.740
Thank you, Reno, for joining us. You're welcome. It's a privilege.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:59.659
But we ask Brother Kask, how are the brothers in Korea doing right now?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.340
Although there is fear throughout the country, our brothers are in good spirits,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.659
and they really are endeavoring to apply the good counsel at Isaiah 26 and verse 3

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:22.139
by fully leaning on Jehovah and by trusting in him. That's very good to hear.

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:30.860
How has the coronavirus pandemic affected the congregation meetings and field ministry

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.339
in your branch territory? Well, we've had to stop holding meetings at the Kingdom Halls

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:45.339
and also stop public witnessing. At first, the brothers were a little bit confused when this happened

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:51.180
because of the suddenness of everything. But once they were informed about the reasons for the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.980
steps that had to be taken, and also when they understood the need to apply Romans 13 and 1 to

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.060
cooperate with the superior authorities or the government officials, they understood immediately

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.379
and started to put into practice the recommendations and the suggestions that were given.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.420
And they were so thankful for these good suggestions, recommendations from the organization.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.660
Well, those are big changes, but no doubt the obedience and cooperation of the brothers

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:31.740
has reflected favorably on Jehovah's name. But what is help the brothers

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.779
maintain their peace of mind during this time? Well, the friends are still keeping a very good

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:46.220
spiritual routine, which is helping them and all of us to stay calm and to keep a proper

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.860
perspective of matters. As far as meetings are concerned, the brothers are either meeting together

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.939
in small groups or they're using video conferencing programs so they can keep in touch and enjoy

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:06.379
the meetings that way and also JW stream. They're also more flexible in their ministry,

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:14.139
their writing letters, their texting, their return visits, their conducting Bible studies over

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.420
the telephone, they're calling their family and friends to see how they are to talk to them,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.939
they're also calling former Bible students to see how they are able to witness this way.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.500
But one other thing too, I might mention that and that is the brothers are really trying hard

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.779
to be balanced in how much time they're spending watching news reports and reading about them.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.459
In fact, it's important, of course, to stay up to date with things that are going on,

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:51.899
but our brothers have found that constantly watching news reports and updates can also

00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:03.360
increase undue or unnecessary anxiety. For a certainty, we can imitate the faith of our brothers

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:11.519
in Korea and their determination to maintain good spiritual routines during this time.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.319
Thank you very much for joining us for this report.

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:19.439
It's been a pleasure. Thank you.

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:28.560
Now we'll go to Italy with brother Greg Chichu. Thank you for being here, Greg.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.620
I'm glad to be here, brother. Thank you.

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:40.300
We know our brothers in Italy are facing many of the same challenges as our brothers in Korea.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:47.660
And in recent weeks, have had to face some especially difficult conditions,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:56.699
including a nationwide lockdown. Can you please tell us how our brothers are doing in Italy?

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:05.410
Well, some of our brothers have contracted COVID-19 and, tragically, as of March 16th,

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.529
six of them have died.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.529
That's majority of our brothers are fine. We're praying for all of them and especially those

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:20.449
who lost dear loved ones in death. We're very glad to hear that most of the brothers are doing well,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.129
but our hearts go out to those who have lost their loved ones.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.529
The news media has reported on the many restrictions in Italy right now.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:39.169
How have our brothers been looking after each other despite these restrictions?

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.210
Well, the brothers really miss associating together in person, but thanks to Jehovah's blessing,

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:53.730
they're doing well spiritually. As Jesus said in John 13, 34, and 35, that love for one another would

00:08:53.730 --> 00:09:00.210
identify his true disciples while we're seeing this love in action here. True government restrictions

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:05.409
prevent us from leaving home freely, but the brothers regularly keep in touch by phone or

00:09:05.409 --> 00:09:11.730
other electronic means. The result is that many are reporting that through this situation,

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.450
it's actually drawing our brothers closer together.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:24.850
That's very encouraging news. Please tell us what the elders are doing to shepherd the brothers.

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:31.039
In addition to providing for physical needs where they were possible,

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:37.279
the elders are video conferencing with individuals and an entire field service groups

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:43.120
to share spiritual, scriptural encouragement. So no one feels isolated. Each one receives

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.399
emotional and spiritual support. Many are expressing a renewed appreciation for their

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:51.679
dear shepherds. For example, one sister wrote,

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:56.559
I feel protected like when a hen gathers her chicks to protect them from a predator.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:05.039
Another brother said, I feel Jehovah's love through my elders. Just as Isaiah 32 verse 2 says,

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:10.320
our elders are really proving to be a hiding place from the wind and a place of concealment from

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:19.039
the rainstorm. How very encouraging. We're excited to hear how Jehovah is getting new brothers

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:25.679
through this difficult time. Our prayers will continue to be with you.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.720
Thank you very much brother le.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.559
Now we'll go to the United States and speak with brother Harold Corcoran, who serves in

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:42.159
Wauk Hill, New York. Brother Corcoran serves as a helper to the publishing committee of the

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:47.440
governing body, but is also a member of the United States Branch Committee.

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:54.080
Thank you for being with us, Harold, and we look forward to hearing from you.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.029
Thank you for the opportunity, brother le.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:05.950
Why don't you tell us how the brothers at World Headquarters and other United States

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:13.580
Bethel facilities are doing? Well, there's no question that we're going through some challenging

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:19.980
times because we've never experienced a health situation with the scope of this one.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.460
But on behalf of the branch committee, we're very happy to report that the Bethel family is coping

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:35.100
well and commendably they have displayed the wisdom from above being ready to obey as described

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:41.659
in the book of James chapter 3 verse 17. And likewise, our brothers in the field, they are quick

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:49.500
to respond to direction from the branch office. That's very good to hear. Can you explain

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:56.299
what practical steps the brothers are taking to avoid spreading the coronavirus?

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:05.539
We're taking very seriously the guidelines that we have received from medical and government

00:12:05.539 --> 00:12:10.899
authorities regarding steps that can be taken to prevent the spread of the virus.

00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:17.299
There are some basic reminders such as regular hand washing, not touching the face,

00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:26.179
avoiding hugs and handshakes, and making sure to disinfect regularly surfaces that are often

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:33.460
touched. And if someone is sick, they should stay home. So we've emphasized these basic

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.899
reminders not only to our fellow workers here at Bethel, but also to those in the field.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:48.179
Those are very practical reminders. Even I have been greeting my brothers with an elbow bump

00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:54.820
instead of a handshake. Can you tell us what other measures have been taken to keep everyone

00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:04.080
as safe as possible? Well, as a precaution for the Bethel family, for our brothers in the field,

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:12.320
and for our neighbors, no tours or guests are permitted at our Bethel complexes at this time.

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:20.799
At the direction of the governing body, no guests attended in person at the recent Gilly

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:29.600
graduation, and the Bethel family was directed to watch the program from their personal rooms.

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:37.200
Now, with the growing concern, the most recent precaution that's being taken is that the

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.720
Bethel family has been directed to not leave their respective complexes for any activity.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:55.200
And that would include shopping, social gatherings, and meetings. And we'd like to emphasize that

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.639
this is a precaution to protect the Bethel family because we did not have an outbreak at this time,

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:07.840
but we're being extra careful to protect them. And we will monitor this latest restriction

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:12.639
on a week-by-week basis to determine how much longer it should continue.

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:18.720
Now, as far as the field is concerned, we have directed that all large

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:24.720
theocratic events throughout the U.S. branch territory should be cancelled until May 17th.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:32.480
Many of the adjustments you've described have no doubt been challenging.

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:42.019
How have the brothers responded? We're happy to report that they have responded very well

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:47.139
to the precautions that have been provided. And we'd also like to say,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.899
rather let on behalf of the branch committee to you dear brothers on the governing body,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.539
thank you very much for your loving direction. We can certainly sense your loving concern

00:14:58.179 --> 00:15:01.460
and your tender affection. So thank you very much.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:09.860
Well, thank you very much, Harold. I'll be sure to pass that appreciation onto the other brothers.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:18.980
We've looked to Jehovah for help in making these decisions. It's encouraging to see how willing

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:25.539
and cooperative our brothers and sisters have been. Thank you very much, Brother Corcoran,

00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:34.019
for sharing this update. You're very welcome. As you've seen from these reports,

00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:43.299
with a situation changing day by day, sometimes hour by hour, many adjustments have had to be made.

00:15:44.259 --> 00:15:51.059
Now, in some cases, the governing body has provided specific direction on how these adjustments

00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:58.899
should be put into effect. But many decisions have been left to those who are most familiar with

00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:06.500
local circumstances, branch committee members, circuit overseers, and congregation elders.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:15.139
To you fateful spirit appointed men serving in these capacities, we'd like to say this,

00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:24.659
we trust you. And we are confident that you'll prayerfully evaluate the facts and local

00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:33.059
circumstances and follow the direction of the superior authorities. And we know that you'll do

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:40.980
all within your power to stay in touch with the congregations. You'll do so on a regular basis

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:49.700
by phone or video conference as necessary. We're also confident that Jehovah spirit will guide you

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:58.259
and give you the mature judgment needed at this time to apply Bible principles properly,

00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:07.940
and to provide clear direction. As for the rest of us, whether the direction we receive comes

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:15.619
from the governing body, the branch, our circuit overseer, or the elders, we want to follow that

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:26.019
direction closely. It can serve as a protection now. And really, if we think about it, it's good

00:17:26.019 --> 00:17:35.700
practice as we had into even more turbulent times ahead. Before we conclude, we'd like to share

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:43.779
a few thoughts about the upcoming memorial of the death of Jesus Christ on April 7th.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:53.059
There's no virus, no pandemic in the world that can dampen our appreciation

00:17:53.059 --> 00:18:02.259
for what Jehovah and Jesus have done for us, or weaken our determination to observe the Lord's

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:12.180
evening meal. Are gathering to commemorate that important event is more than a tradition?

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:24.579
It's a command. Recorded at Luke 22, verse 19. Let's read that together. Luke 22, verse 19.

00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:35.140
Also, he, Jesus, took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying,

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:45.859
this means my body, which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.

00:18:46.819 --> 00:18:52.339
So will we keep doing this in remembrance of Jesus as he commanded?

00:18:54.019 --> 00:19:02.259
Absolutely. But how we do so may vary depending on our local circumstances.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:09.299
If it's possible in your area, we encourage you to meet with your congregation.

00:19:10.259 --> 00:19:16.980
You can be sure that the elders will take practical measures for the benefit of all those attending.

00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:25.859
Of course, in some areas, local circumstances created by COVID-19 may prevent you from meeting as

00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:34.180
a congregation. In that case, you may receive direction from your elders to meet in smaller groups,

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:41.940
to use video conferencing like Skype or Zoom, or if none of those options are possible

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:50.660
to watch the program on jw.org. How thankful we are to Jehovah,

00:19:51.619 --> 00:19:59.539
that he's equipped us to be able to drink the milk of nations as mentioned in Isaiah 60, verse 16,

00:20:00.339 --> 00:20:09.380
which includes the wise use of technology. Regardless of the specific arrangements involved,

00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:20.900
we all want to prepare our hearts and do whatever is necessary to obey Jesus' command to celebrate

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:29.299
the Lord's evening meal. Just think for a moment about Jesus' sacrifice and what it means.

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:36.099
Especially in the light of this global health crisis, by means of the ransom,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:44.660
Jehovah has made provision to completely eliminate problems such as pestilence from the earth,

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:50.980
not just this one viral pandemic, but all sickness and death.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:21:03.059
Admittedly, the events we see around us are now creating times hard to deal with just as the

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:13.299
Bible foretold. But these events also remind us of how close we are to seeing a complete solution

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:22.259
to all these problems forever. We want you to know that the governing body

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:31.460
loves you deeply and will keep you in our prayers. Our brothers in the United States,

00:21:32.099 --> 00:21:36.900
Italy and Korea send their warm love and greetings.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:46.900
