00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:17.300
Dorothy McFee has a life-threatening medical problem, an artery that could burst at any time.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:27.300
A normal way of doing this operation is generally through the abdomen, a long vertical incision.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.299
Leslie is a young girl with a serious spinal deformity.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:39.299
Patient is a Jehovah's Witness, and in a procedure of this magnitude that is unavoidable,

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:41.299
that some blood loss will occur.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:48.969
Both patients need surgery.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:56.859
Yet, both patients have religious beliefs that preclude their accepting a blood transfusion.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.859
Medical science is now providing doctors with alternative strategies to treat successfully patients

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.859
who, for various reasons, avoid blood transfusions.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.859
These new strategies may soon benefit all patients.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:31.739
At the dawn of the 21st century, society is becoming increasingly diverse.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:44.019
People everywhere are being exposed to different languages, customs, cultures, and religious beliefs.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:55.939
Adapting to these differences is a challenge to all strata of human society.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.480
It is a singular challenge for the medical community.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:12.979
Being in a pluralistic society, and the doctor has one set of values,

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:20.979
but he or she will meet patients who have their own values and their own position about certain issues.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.979
There's a lot of different cultures out there, and they have entity specific to their own cultures

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.979
that we as healthcare workers need to understand.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:35.979
I think the duty of physician is not simply to preserve life,

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:44.449
but the first and foremost duty of physician is to respect the patient.

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.449
In the past, the medical profession found it difficult at times

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:55.449
to respect the healthcare needs of one religious group in particular, Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:59.449
This was because of their avoidance of blood transfusions.

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:05.449
That was the easiest decision, because there was under no circumstances when I accept blood.

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:09.449
One thing I heard, he says blood transfusion, and immediately I said, no, no.

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:14.449
It couldn't live with myself if I turned my back on my beliefs and my God,

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.449
and I wasn't going to accept the blood transfusion.

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:25.370
Their abstaining from blood transfusions was often misunderstood by the public.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.370
There was certainly a time in years back where Jehovah's Witnesses were looked at by physicians

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.370
and especially surgeons in a negative way.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.370
I think before I had ever met Jehovah Witness, I had a certain mindset

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.370
that they were maybe a religious, fanatic type person.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.370
Part of it I'm sure is prejudice about a religious sect,

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.370
which the physician or the judge or the lawyer,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.370
about which they may know next to nothing.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.370
A lot of people nowadays have heard of dangers or diseases that might be contracted

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.370
for blood and blood transfusions, but frankly for Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.370
central to their avoiding blood transfusions is because the Bible highlights

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.370
the preciousness of blood.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.370
It's a very clear statement, by the way.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.370
It isn't something that takes a lot of theological study to determine or work out.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.639
It says very plainly the Christian scriptures abstain from blood.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.639
From the point of view of someone who's not a believer,

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.639
this seems in a rational act.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.639
For some people, it seems to be anti-medicine.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.639
It seems to be somehow putting the patient in jeopardy.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.639
Some of us, myself included, was under the impression that maybe Jehovah's Witnesses

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.639
didn't want the best medical treatment that they were sort of against medical care.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.639
There's no question it mattered to me whether she lived or died.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.639
I brought her to the hospital in the first place to help her recover.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.639
I didn't want to just die, and I don't think anybody wants that to happen.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.639
It's not some sort of a suicide pact that they want to enter into with you.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.639
They want to have good health care, and I think that you can work with them.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.639
I realized they wanted the best medical care, but they just wanted it without blood.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.639
I think the effort has to be made to remove the perception that Jehovah's Witnesses

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.639
are somehow in a category by themselves.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.639
Clearly, you can point to many religions.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.639
They all have one issue or another, which you may or may not agree, but that's not the issue.

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.639
But this is a religious precept.

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.639
This is not illogical stubbornness.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.639
This is a religious belief.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.639
And just as I respect the religious beliefs of many other religions,

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.639
I think I have to respect that.

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:10.420
All patients, as a general rule, have the right to receive treatment

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:19.420
or to refuse to receive that treatment after they've had full open and candid discussion

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.420
with the treating physician.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:29.420
I believe the basic element of patients' right is the right of self-determination,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:38.420
that is the right of any patient to decide what shall be done with his or her own body.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.790
Patient rights, notwithstanding, some have claimed that declining what they consider

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.790
life-saving medical treatment is irrational.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:59.790
It's wrong to equate a refusal of a treatment with suicide, which is a conscious choice to end one's life.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.790
There is always a legitimate question about a patient's competence,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.790
but just the mere refusal of blood in itself is not any kind of such indication.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.790
I don't believe that refusal of treatment is irresponsible or irrational.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:22.790
I think that just because one person chooses to not take this pill or that fluid

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.790
or this kind of solution is their own personal choices.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.790
We have patients who say they don't want to be on a mechanical ventilator.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.139
They don't want a breathing tube.

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:37.139
It's an everyday event for a patient who has malignancy, a cancer,

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:39.139
to refuse some treatment or other.

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.139
They don't want to have chemotherapy, they don't want to have radical surgery.

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:48.139
So the idea that patients refuse treatment is something that I work with,

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:53.310
not to take as a personal insult.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:58.310
These facts are often obscured by news stories, claiming that someone died

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:04.100
because he refused a blood transfusion.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.100
To say that one has died because of refusal of blood

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.100
I think is a very general misleading statement.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.100
That's an oversimplification of the tragic event.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:22.100
It's rarely, if ever, the case, that a patient refused a blood transfusion

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.100
and therefore died.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:30.100
People die because of either a medical disease or a consequence of trauma

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.100
or surgery where there has been complications.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.100
I can tell you I have done over 200 dual-witness patients.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.100
I have never lost a patient because I could not give the patient blood.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:50.409
Why then does blood transfusion remain the standard treatment for serious blood loss?

00:08:50.409 --> 00:08:58.409
I think that physicians have been brought up with the idea that blood is the gift of life

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:03.409
and that inherently blood is good for you.

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:09.409
The refusal to accept a blood transfusion

00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:17.409
bothers and concerns many physicians because they're worried that without the transfusion

00:09:17.409 --> 00:09:23.409
the well-being of the patient is jeopardized.

00:09:23.409 --> 00:09:26.409
To appreciate fully why physicians feel this way,

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:31.409
one needs to understand a little about blood and why transfusions are given.

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:46.590
Blood circulates through the body by means of an amazingly intricate system of conduits

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:53.080
called veins and arteries.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.080
Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.080
eventually branching into tiny vessels called capillaries.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.080
These deliver the oxygen-rich red blood cells to every part of the body.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:15.350
Nutrients and oxygen are exchanged for carbon dioxide and other wastes at the cellular level.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:25.799
Vains then transport the oxygen depleted blood back to the heart which pumps it to the lungs.

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:36.899
There, the carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen and the cycle begins anew.

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:42.820
This cycle is absolutely essential to life.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.820
If there's no blood to bring the oxygen to the cells, the cells die, the body dies.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:57.820
When someone suffers severe blood loss, doctors have two urgent priorities.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.820
The most critical in me is to stop the bleeding.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.820
Everything takes back seat to stop the bleeding.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.820
And number two is to restore the volume within your system.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.820
What can happen when a patient loses too much blood volume?

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.820
Then you don't deliver blood to the brain or to other organs and a person can die.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:26.100
And what you need to do is restore volume, restore perfusion, and restore oxygenation.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:32.100
A way of correcting that decrease in blood volume is by giving out the fluids intravenously.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:40.100
This can be done using any one of a number of fluid types and doesn't necessarily require blood.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:51.679
Increasing numbers of patients are opting to avoid blood transfusions for personal reasons.

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:56.679
If you've ever had a conversation with a patient the night before surgery and you were to ask them

00:11:56.679 --> 00:12:01.679
if they had a preference, would they prefer to avoid a blood transfusion? The answer is always yes.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:12.679
I would say that today at least 80% of the patients would strongly favor not to have blood transfusions.

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:20.679
Blood transfusion traditionally considered a normal adjunct to surgery.

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:25.679
Presently is considered something that has to be avoided.

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:33.559
There are real risks as far as transfusions are concerned.

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:41.509
There are concerns about blood-borne pathogens and certainly the concern about AIDS.

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:48.269
It's a biological product. It can have diseases, et cetera.

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:52.269
We screen for most of them, but there are some there that we just don't know about.

00:12:52.269 --> 00:13:00.269
We've certainly seen some horrendous new diseases in the form of HIV come along

00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:05.269
that probably didn't exist in the past, whether the next disease will come along in 10 weeks

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:11.289
and 10 years or 100 years, nobody can say.

00:13:11.289 --> 00:13:17.289
We have hepatitis C, hepatitis B that are transmitted in the cost, social costs that are very high.

00:13:17.289 --> 00:13:24.289
There are transfusion reactions that occur, they're very rare, but they can be potentially dangerous or even life threatening.

00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:27.289
We can mix the blood up and cause catastrophe.

00:13:27.289 --> 00:13:31.289
Patients have died and do die from getting the wrong blood.

00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:45.580
It is interesting to realize now in the late 90s or early 2000 that the blood transfusion to a certain extent

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.580
does not do what we always use blood transfusion for.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:57.580
We have become persuaded over the years that many of the bad things that happen to patients after surgery

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:05.580
are in fact not bad luck, are not lack of surgical scale, but are in fact the complications of transfusion.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.580
These concerns have spurred the development of a wide range of alternative strategies,

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:17.580
treatments that are acceptable to many of Jehovah's Witnesses and others who also choose to avoid blood transfusions.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.580
Alternative strategies can be grouped around four organizing principles.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:32.580
That involves anesthetic factors, it involves the use of certain substances and it certainly involves a surgical technique.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:40.370
The most important technique to control bleeding is to avoid bleeding.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:48.370
But with less bleeding during surgery, the result at the end is better and the outcome is more likely to be smooth.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.370
Careful surgery means preventing blood loss, age is no factor.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:57.370
We have operated on newborns, we have operated on people in their 90s.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:04.370
A surgeon who operates without losing large amount of blood is almost invariably a good and careful surgeon.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.370
One who loses large amounts of blood is most often the reverse.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:17.379
A variety of instruments are now available to help surgeons minimize bleeding.

00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:27.230
There are strategies for intraoperatively using electrocordory instead of scalpels.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:35.230
If there's some bleeding persisting, there are calculation techniques, best of which is at the moment argon beam calculation.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:45.149
There are non-invasive tools that enable the surgeon to see inside the body, minimizing surgical incisions.

00:15:45.149 --> 00:15:51.149
You can use drugs, a topical application of different products that will help prevent blood loss.

00:15:52.149 --> 00:15:57.149
We have now several methods available that like the fibrene glue.

00:15:57.149 --> 00:16:02.149
Fibrene glue made from blood fractions stimulates coagulation upon contact.

00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:08.149
The fibrene tissue adhesive is certainly very, very useful because it does not harm the tissue.

00:16:08.149 --> 00:16:16.149
In Jehovah's Witness where blood loss is so, so, so critical, I think that you have to be extremely meticulous not to lose even a drop of blood.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:36.190
There are new technologies of hemodilution and re-infusion that make the operation easier and which are acceptable to people who have a religious precept against blood transfusions.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:44.190
The principles of hemodilution in terms of reduction of blood loss are really quite simple.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.889
We do the closed circuit on the patient.

00:16:48.889 --> 00:17:03.620
We draw off blood from the patient, keep it in contact with the patient and substitute it with fluids.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:13.619
That results in a diluted blood and therefore the patient loses only diluted blood rather than native or concentrated blood.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:18.619
When the patient bleeds interoperatively, the red cell loss is less.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:27.619
It would be like taking quarter milk and turning it, adding water so you have three gallons of it now but the original quarter is still in there.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:36.619
But if you were to spill it into something it would be a lot of water and a fraction of the milk and then at the end you get rid of the water and then you're back to where you started.

00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:43.619
And we use that routinely in this institution especially for those patients who have anticipated a significant blood loss.

00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:54.180
I think that's probably nowadays besides not just for Jehovah Winner is a pretty good standard of care for large volume loss surgery.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:04.529
If we do lose blood this is a kind of case where we use a cell saver. It will suction up any blood that's lost.

00:18:04.529 --> 00:18:12.920
We wash it, we clean it, we process it, we filter it and then we'll give it back to you.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:21.920
Cell salvage is a very important technique because when you use cell salvage the blood lost by the surgeon is not lost for the patient.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:28.920
In any trauma patient with the significant blood loss I would always prepare the cell saver system.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:37.920
A key element in stimulating the body's ability to replenish its own blood supply is a hormone called erythropoietin.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:52.920
Erythropoietin is a natural substance. It is formed in the kidneys, other organs as well, but primarily the kidney to help our bone marrow's formed the red blood cells that are going to carry our oxygen.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:19:01.920
Blood cell production takes place primarily in the sternum, the ribs, the vertebrae and the pelvis.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:08.920
The recombinant erythropoietin boosts the body's natural production of red blood cells.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:17.920
If I know the patient is going to be in the hospital a long time I may start them on some recombinant erythropoietin so that they can start building up their own blood stores.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:28.920
This can be a very cost effective strategy to reduce the utilization of allogeneic blood transfusion.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:40.390
One of the most exciting things about this whole field and transfusion alternatives is that the majority of things that we talk about are within the reach of physicians and hospitals around the world.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:51.390
They are now available techniques in almost every subspecialty of surgery and medicine that allow bloodless treatment.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:56.390
And alternatives like any other therapy are not necessarily free from risk.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:08.390
So a patient, a witness patient in particular may want to become informed about the benefits and the risks that are associated with any particular treatment.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.390
They should be a prudent consumer.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:20.119
How effective are these alternative strategies in helping doctors treat patients who do not want blood transfusions?

00:20:25.539 --> 00:20:36.200
Leslie Lacks had just begun elementary school when it became apparent that she had a degenerating spinal deformity.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:42.200
Doctors diagnosed Leslie's condition as a severe form of scoliosis.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:51.200
Scoliosis is a curvature of the spine so we have to correct it as much as the spine flexibility allows us.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:58.200
After a brace failed to correct her condition, doctors recommended an extensive surgical procedure.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:13.220
We use essentially a series of hooks and metal rods made out of stainless steel that are implanted in the patient's back and used to essentially distract the spine and achieve alignment.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:18.220
The Lacks wanted the surgery performed without a blood transfusion.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:23.220
So they found a surgical team that had experience using bloodless techniques.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:34.380
Before the surgery, Leslie's doctors boosted her blood through the use of iron and recombinant erythropoietin.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:42.759
So it was essential that we do the surgery without excessive blood loss.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:47.759
The way that we were able to achieve this is using two techniques.

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:51.759
Basically one of them is what's called the cell saber.

00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:55.759
The other technique we used is called hemodilution.

00:21:55.759 --> 00:22:04.759
It is safer in that it is the patient's own blood and it has remained in continuous circulation with the patient.

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:10.759
So there's no transfer contamination or blood transmitted diseases.

00:22:10.759 --> 00:22:15.759
The surgery was a success and no blood transfusion was administered.

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:19.759
Within days, Leslie was up and walking.

00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:29.440
She's so happy. She can be the stand. She's now going to say mommy almost told us you now.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:37.440
Although Leslie will have to wear a brace for a while, doctors are confident she will lead a normal life.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:45.440
I would like to skate and skateboard. Maybe learn how to snowboard and stuff like that.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:23:00.200
Sometimes alternative strategies involve new surgical techniques to reduce blood loss in patients that don't want a transfusion.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:10.200
75-year-old Dorothy McFee suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a life-threatening condition that traditionally requires extensive surgery.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:21.200
The normal way of doing this operation is generally through the abdomen, a long vertical incision from the lower chest down to the pubic area,

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:31.200
having to work around and behind the entire intestinal tract, hospitalization ranging at best days, four or five days,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:38.200
to an average of a week or even more, presuming there are no operative complications.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:47.450
Since Dorothy is one of Jehovah's Witnesses, her physicians used a surgical technique that minimizes bleeding.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:52.450
What we did today is called endovascular aortic surgery.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:59.240
Specifically, endovascular meaning we're working within the artery.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:08.240
Through that artery, we place our catheters or wires, all the instruments that we steer right up into where the aneurysm is.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.240
And then we can visualize the aneurysm by doing fluoroscopy, x-ray technology.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:26.130
Dorothy's surgeons inserted a wire mesh called a stent, and were thus able to repair her aorta without a large surgical incision that would have caused a lot of bleeding.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:39.130
Small incision in the groin, all the manipulations through that, a virtually pain-free, complication-free post-opinative course, home generally 24 hours.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.130
So everybody's a winner.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.130
I feel fine. I never would have believed it.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:51.130
Two days after her surgery, Dorothy was sent home.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.130
She recovered nicely.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:25:07.079
A growing number of healthcare providers are willing to meet the challenge of treating patients who avoid blood transfusions.

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:18.079
With the development of all those techniques, there's nothing really specific about her who was witnessed anymore.

00:25:18.079 --> 00:25:25.079
We know that they don't want blood transfusion, and we have the technology to follow their wish.

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:33.079
The belief that you don't want to blood transfusion should not in any way, that should be a tiny part of the whole medical care environment.

00:25:33.079 --> 00:25:37.079
That should be acknowledged, be put over to the side, fine.

00:25:37.079 --> 00:25:39.079
Now is the other 99% of your care.

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:44.079
I guess it could be likened to a patient who is allergic to penicillin.

00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:51.079
You wouldn't expect the physician to say, well, I'm sorry, I can't treat you because I can't administer penicillin.

00:25:51.079 --> 00:26:00.079
No. He simply says, we'll give you a medical alternative. We'll give you another antibiotic, and he gets on with treating the patient.

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:09.079
This enlightened approach to patient care has exciting implications for the public at large.

00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:16.079
The fact that we couldn't use blood in Jehovah's Witness, we learned how we didn't have to use blood in many, many other situations.

00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:20.079
So it has actually propelled us in the right direction.

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:27.079
Transfusion alternatives clearly are good medical practice, sound medical practice, safe practice for our patients.

00:26:27.079 --> 00:26:32.079
Indeed, it is a standard that should be available to all patients.

00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:36.079
What we're talking about here is going to be a moot point.

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:48.079
Because bloodless medicine and surgery will become in the next five to ten years, so widespread, that it won't be novel anymore.

00:26:48.079 --> 00:26:55.970
Jehovah's Witnesses have had the unique privilege because of their religious position in the matter

00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:01.970
of helping doctors to learn better ways to treat patients without subjecting them to the risks of blood transfusions.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:14.970
What I have seen in my own experience is that they have turned the medical profession around to the point where the gold standard of treatment frequently now is to treat people without blood.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:29.299
Already, some 100,000 physicians worldwide are making bloodless medicine and surgery available to any patient who does not want a blood transfusion.

00:27:29.299 --> 00:27:44.940
Many experts agree that in the near future, medicine and surgery without the use of blood transfusions will be the standard of care for all patients.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:28:00.940
There are now available techniques in almost every subspecialty of surgery and medicine that allow bloodless treatment, that we are getting away from blood transfusions in general.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:13.730
As a heart surgeon, it's unusual for the guy not to like blood, you should love blood, but I don't.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:18.730
I'm very proud when my patient comes out of the operating room as not to see any transfusion.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:33.059
I can see what's in the next few years, getting to a point where we do not have to even think about getting blood.
