00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.079
My grandparents were witnesses and my mother embraced the truth very early.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:23.079
She was a very spiritual person and she had a wonderful influence on us as children.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.079
We were poor family, but I reached family spiritually.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:35.079
I started full-time service in April 1954.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:45.079
I think my husband was attracted to me because of my involvement in the ministry and also in spiritual matters.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.359
So he went to Gilead. His graduation was November.

00:00:51.359 --> 00:01:00.359
In December we got married and in January we headed for Belize right away.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.359
We were missionaries for just two years.

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:15.359
When I got pregnant, my husband's reaction initially was frightened that he wasn't prepared for it.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:21.359
And we had to leave the missionary home, but we got accommodations pretty close by.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:32.359
I said to Gilead that I would like this child to be like Samuel to be used by him.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:41.359
And I begged Gilead to help me to train her and to look at her as a gift from him.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.359
So they would always include us in whatever plans they had at the branch.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.359
They would always say, bring her with you.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.359
So I look back with fondness then.

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:04.359
My daughter would join us in the ministry and the brothers in Belize would help to take her in the ministry also.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.360
I would say my daughter did grow up as a missionary.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.360
In Belize I had many Bible studies.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.770
I'm very happy for the years I served there.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:26.770
I returned to Jamaica and I continued to get phone calls or cards.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.770
I get news constantly from them and their children.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.770
We were assigned to go in the traveling work.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.770
So for the times that I did six years of circuit work.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:52.770
It built me up spiritually and I could feel the hope as hand taking care of my needs.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.050
I spoke to him while he was dying.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.050
And I reminded him what I could father, he had been a good elder, a good husband.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.050
And my daughter was a support to me after that he heard father died.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.050
When my daughter died, I felt lost.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:30.919
I'm still grieving for her since she has died, the peace of God.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.919
That excels all I thought.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.919
God's my heart, my mental powers.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:43.919
I do a lot of personal study, a lot of Bible reading.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:49.919
I just read the Bible over and over and just continue to learn.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.919
Plus I listen to the programs regularly.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.919
I try to keep up to date with what's going on.

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.919
I try to do as much as I can.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:16.920
I try to encourage the younger ones to make good choices in their lives which include the full-time service.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.920
They keep saying just my presence at the meeting.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.920
Just seeing me encourage them.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.920
Every time we go to the meeting, the little ones come to hug.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.920
I have an expression I tell them I live by homes now.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.920
It's a testimony that Jehovah can take care of us.
