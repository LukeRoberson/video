00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.650
I'm so pleased to say that the sister who wrote that letter about her anxieties is actually

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.650
here with us in the studio to tell us more about her experience.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.570
This is Jordan Williams and her husband Robert.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.769
Thank you so much for coming here to share with us your battle with anxiety.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.969
Can you elaborate on that please?

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:25.530
I feel ashamed of my anxiety.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.730
I feel like there's something wrong with me and I feel guilty about that.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.369
I feel like I'm letting Jehovah down by feeling anxious and that I'm even being disobedient

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:39.850
to Jesus when he says, stop being anxious, but I just can't.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.649
Thank you for sharing that, Robert.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.570
What do you do to help Jordan battle this anxiety?

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.049
It's a monster that sometimes a very stubborn monster that won't go away.

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:58.289
Remembering that, remembering that it's not her fault that helps me be more compassionate,

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.730
listening when she's explaining these anxieties that I may not completely understand.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.489
Jordan, are there other practical things that help you battle anxiety?

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:12.530
The single biggest help is walking with Jehovah every day.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.530
I mean that literally.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.689
I'll wake up in the morning, super anxious and I can't breathe and my chest is tight

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.530
and I'll get up and I'll read the chapter of the Bible that the daily text comes from

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.370
and then I'll go on a walk and talk to Jehovah for an hour.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.969
And I try to use the model prayer as an outline.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:38.689
So I'll talk to Jehovah about his name and how I feel so privileged to have that name on me.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.489
And I'll talk to him about his kingdom that's going to solve all of these problems,

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:45.170
including anxiety.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.450
And I'll talk to him about his will and specifically what his will is for me that day.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:57.689
And most of the time, those three things cover the things that were worrying me.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.290
But if there is another thing, I'll talk to him specifically about that.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.650
What a nice walk you have with Jehovah.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.129
Are there other things that help you deal and battle anxiety?

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:11.889
Personal study projects help a lot, especially if they don't have anything to do with anxiety.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.689
If I do a study project on like the spiritual suit of armor or the ransom,

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.330
it kind of distracts the anxiety monster.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.569
So my heart can calm down.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.009
And then these pearls of wisdom will come from Jehovah and they can get in.

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.569
And if some of those pearls are actually just what I need to deal with my anxiety.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.930
Are there specific things that help you?

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.849
Yes.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.169
I made an anxiety tab in the personal study section of my study Bible on my tablet.

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:44.530
And I collect scriptures and comments that really help with my anxiety.

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.569
For example, in 2014, there was a regional convention talk about Matthew chapter six

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.569
and six specific things that combat anxiety.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.289
And it made me think of like the 12-step program to overcoming addiction.

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:01.969
This is the six steps to overcoming anxiety.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.569
What are those six steps?

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.169
The first one is to help those in need and then pray a lot to be forgiving,

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.810
not to be hypocritical, to store up treasures in heaven,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.689
and then to focus on spiritual matters.

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.090
So when we got back from the convention, she took those items,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.449
she wrote them down and put them on magnets and put them on our refrigerator.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.409
I try to do each one of those six things every day.

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.770
And when I accomplish one, I'll turn the magnet so I can see what I still need to work on.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.169
So when I come into the refrigerator in the morning, if the magnets are turned,

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.129
we know where she's at.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.930
If they're not turned, we know we're in trouble.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.729
It's a bad day.

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:39.729
Time to do something else.

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.449
Very good, nice barometer.

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:46.090
So what can others do or say that would be helpful to those going through anxiety?

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.050
For the friends, it's really nice when they're understanding and non-judgmental

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.409
and respect my privacy.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:56.569
That's really helpful.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.370
And when they don't freeze me in time, decide that, oh, she's anxious,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.090
and this is how she's going to be all the time.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.770
That's really helpful.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.889
I even forget that Jehovah approves of me.

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:16.490
So reminding me of that, reminding me that the things that I do to please him are successful.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.209
And maybe even reminding me of things that I've accomplished for Jehovah in the past.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.889
You know you should tell Ron about your broken dish.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.129
Oh, yeah.

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.290
Yes, I'd like to know about that.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.930
So I just found out about this Japanese art called Kinsukuroi.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.850
And it's basically taking a broken piece of pottery and fixing it

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.290
by putting it back together with gold or silver lacquer.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.649
And the concept is that the piece is more beautiful for having been broken.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:51.170
And that really resonates with me because I do feel broken by anxiety.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.290
But Jehovah gave Jesus his the ransom, and that ransom is just pure gold.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.290
And he can take all the broken anxious little bits of me and put me back together.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.089
And maybe I'll even be more useful to Jehovah for having been broken.

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:08.370
That's very precious.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.970
Thank you for sharing that.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.930
Are there other things that help you deal with anxiety?

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.850
I've learned to recognize when anxiety is clouding my thinking.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.050
And I'll ask him, can I borrow your brain for a minute, please?

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.370
So what we did is we went and purchased a whiteboard, put it in my office.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.730
And sometimes we'll go to the whiteboard and write out all the anxieties that she's dealing with.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.649
As we're writing them out, sometimes we realize those are yesterday's anxieties.

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:34.930
And they've been cared for.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.449
So we can erase those from the board.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.930
Some of them are from tomorrow.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.050
And so we don't want to borrow those and bring them today.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.170
That's tomorrow's anxiety.

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:46.209
And some anxieties can be grouped in little clusters.

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:48.529
And you can realize the root is here.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:51.410
Let's focus on that.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.209
I fight anxiety every single day.

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:57.569
And anxiety is constantly changing its tactics.

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:59.089
So I have to be adaptable.

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.569
But Jehovah never leaves me to fight anxiety alone ever.

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:08.930
I don't understand what I've done to merit all of his attention.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.209
But I do realize that I don't need to understand why he loves me.

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:16.209
I trust him and he never lies.

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:19.410
So I just need to accept it when he shows me that love.

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.529
We appreciate you sharing those personal feelings.

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:26.529
And again, we know that Jehovah and Jesus are so proud of you.

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:29.089
And we know that those who are listening into this interview

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:33.649
will benefit so much from listening to your personal expressions.

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:34.850
Thank you very much.
