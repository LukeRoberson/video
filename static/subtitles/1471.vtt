00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.719
The prophecy at Psalm 110 verses 1 to 3,

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:09.720
foretold that the newly installed king Christ Jesus

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.720
would have an army of willing volunteers

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.719
to preach the good news of the kingdom in all the earth.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:21.719
And today we have over 8 million kingdom proclaimers.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.719
But to support this global campaign

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:30.719
has required many Bethelites working in Bethel facilities.

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.719
In addition, we have remote translation offices.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.719
Hundreds of brothers and sisters are working in these offices

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.719
doing translation, translating literature,

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.719
audio recordings, and videos.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.719
There are many brothers and sisters who are doing support services

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.719
cooking meals, doing the laundry,

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.719
cleaning the facilities, and maintaining them.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.719
In addition to remote translation offices,

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.719
we have remote volunteers.

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.719
These are brothers and sisters who are assisting with Bethel work

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.719
but working out of their own homes.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.719
It is quite heartwarming to see the sacrifices

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.719
that these friends make.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.719
Many of them have families, some of them are mothers

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.719
with children to care for, and yet they devote

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.719
many hours during the week to Bethel work.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.719
And brothers who also work secondarily

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.719
and care for their congregation responsibilities.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.719
What a wonderful example of self-sacrifice and loyal service.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.719
Our remote volunteers are a tremendous help

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.719
to our work in the computer department.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.719
Now of course, our computer work lends itself to the fact

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.719
that we can use remote workers.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.719
And you may be interested to know we currently have 200

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.719
remote volunteers here in the United States.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.719
Some help with help desk calls, others are consultants,

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.719
but many help with our programming projects.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.719
For example, a few years ago, we needed software

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.719
to help build kingdom halls here in the United States.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.719
And we decided to try and organize the brothers and sisters

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.719
in the field to do this work.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.719
And the blessing that has turned out to be.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.719
I mean, the builder assistant program has been

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.719
completely designed and developed in the field.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.719
The brothers and sisters did outstanding work.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.719
Now, builder assistant is not only going to be used here

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.719
in the United States to help build kingdom halls,

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.719
but also in the branches around the world.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.719
It's really hard to imagine how this work

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.719
and many other projects could have been done

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.719
without our remote volunteers.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.719
I'm truly grateful for their help.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.719
I felt I was just dreaming.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.719
There was a big surprise when I got approval

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:58.719
to work as a remote volunteer at home here.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.719
It's serving for the service department as a translator.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.719
And especially on the first day of my service,

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.719
when they are sitting at my computer

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.719
and the connectivity to the server at Bethel.

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.719
I was too happy to believe it's a reality.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.719
Several years ago, we realized that a life

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.719
was not simple enough.

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.719
Having much room for further simplification,

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.719
although we hadn't worked as regular pioneers for many years.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.719
So since that time, we have gradually simplified a life

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.719
and includes selling our house

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.719
and reducing our cars from 2 to 1.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.719
And you see, we have often prayed

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.719
that we will be allowed to do our very best

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.719
for the outworking of Jehovah's will

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.719
and Jehovah's hero prayer.

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.719
And he helped us a lot to make more time

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.719
for the speech activities

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.719
including this service on the remote basis

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.719
with much less.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:08.719
But I feel very happy to support this very important work

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.719
in a special way as a translator

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.719
that Faith and Slave has been taking the lead

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.720
in this global preaching campaign

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.720
and distributing the speech or food at the proper time.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.720
So this is a wonderful privilege for me

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.720
as a translator to support their work.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.720
It was the best news I've received.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.720
I've got very happy to get the approval

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.720
to continue working with Faith from home.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.720
But as time went by,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.720
I had to look at for a part-time job

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.720
in order to afford the basic necessities

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.720
and still have a time for serve

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.720
as a remote volunteer and a regular pioneer.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.720
I feel that my work contributes to the work

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.720
of the Natbatham,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.720
which has the main goal of providing publications

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.720
and instructions for the preaching work.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.720
And Jehovah has blessed this work so much

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.720
that when I needed his help the most,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.720
he gave it to me in a way that I couldn't even imagine.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.720
His answers to my prayers were so quick

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.720
that I was astonished.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.720
It was certainly Jehovah's hand helping me

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.720
at the time of need.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.720
We have enjoyed various assignments in the past,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.720
but serving faithful is something special to me.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.720
And to be asked to serve again

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.720
and the artiones are more,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.720
well, it was very humbling.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.720
I work in the home department along with others,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.720
and we provide support for the translation department.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.720
And doing so, we provide delicious meals

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.720
caring for the laundry and cleaning rooms.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.720
This helps our dear hardworking brothers and sisters

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.720
in translation to concentrate on their assigned task.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.720
And in turn, we are supporting the preaching work.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.720
And when we engage in the ministry in the weekends

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.720
and seeing the way people react to the literature

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.720
in their own language,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.720
it's very fulfilling and satisfying.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.720
Jehovah has been good to me,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.720
and I just love working on the artione.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.720
I thank Jehovah for allowing me

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.720
to be used in this capacity of full-time service.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.720
I would not swap it for anything

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.720
at Satan's World Office.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.720
It is so heartwarming and encouraging to see

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.720
the brothers and sisters' reactions.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.720
Even just a smile or comment from the young ones,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.720
like, oh, that DVD was amazing.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.720
We watched it over and over again.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.720
Those kind of comments really touch my heart

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.720
and sometimes I can't help it but give way to tears.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.720
When I see how people react with a magazine

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.720
or a book that I knew I was involved in translating it,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.720
it brings me so much joy.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.720
To me, it's a blessing.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.720
When you are very busy in Jehovah's work all the time.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.720
Serving in the artione is the translator's best life ever.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.720
Clearly, God's Kingdom

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.720
is expanding its operations in all the earth today.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.720
And what a wonderful privilege we have

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.720
to be God's fellow workers,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.720
to have a share in this never-to-be-repeated work.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.720
Whether we're working in a Bethel home,

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.720
a remote translation office,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.720
or a remote volunteer doing this work in our own home,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.720
all to Jehovah's glory and honor.
