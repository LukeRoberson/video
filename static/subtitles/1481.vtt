00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.750
You are about to take a historic journey.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.750
The decade of the 1950s was a time of tremendous expansion for Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.750
A factor in this growth was a film released in 1954 by the Watchtower Society

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.750
entitled The New World Society in Action.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.750
It was made to assist interested ones to see for themselves

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.750
the smooth functioning and international scope of Jehovah's Organization.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.750
In its first year alone, this film was shown in more than 75 lands.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.750
Even many long-time witnesses had never before seen the large and efficient publishing facilities.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.750
Nor did they fully appreciate the truly international brotherhood that Jehovah's Witnesses enjoy.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.750
In the Southern United States, sometimes the Kingdom Halls were storefronts

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:01.750
or large halls or homes and so for people to see the vastness of the organization.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.750
It made a great impression.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.750
Small congregation meeting in a brother's home, 20 publishers, 25 publishers perhaps.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.750
So that's all that we knew the organization to be.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.750
You never really thought or at least I never thought before of how are these magazines produced

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.750
and all of the work that went into writing them and shipping them and so on.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.750
You just never thought of that until we saw that film.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.750
But the film accomplished much more.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.750
It helped unbelieving relatives gain a more balanced view of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.750
Additionally, it helped break down prejudice in the communities that were opposed to their work.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.750
And it also helped the millions that saw it appreciate Jehovah's Witnesses

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.750
were fulfilling a significant Bible prophecy.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.750
They were preaching the good news of God's Kingdom worldwide.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.750
Of course, people weren't familiar with the society.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.750
And it made it more real.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.750
This film gave a view of the organization that they would not receive from the printed page

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.750
or from the oral witness that we were giving.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.750
It stimulated me to take action, seeing it.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.750
Well, that was the time I made up my mind to dedicate myself to Jehovah.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.750
I think it's another example of how the society has used technology

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.750
and various features to further the advertising of the King and the Kingdom all down through the years.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.750
The New World Society in Action had a profound effect on Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:53.750
It spurred them on and it helped them to realize that this organization is truly a product of God's Spirit.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.750
We now invite you to see for yourself the 1954 film, The New World Society in Action.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:21.789
The New World Society in Action, a film produced for you by the Watchtower Bible and Track Society in Brooklyn, New York.

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:33.379
This tower is on the roof of the Watchtower's Brooklyn Baffle Home.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:41.379
From here you can see, on the right, the Empire State Building, then Midtown Manhattan, the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.379
The skyscrapers of Lower Manhattan, the Wall Street Financial District,

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.379
and the bustling New York Harbor. This is New York City.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:04:07.550
Just across the east river from all this bustle of commerce, at 124 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn, is the Bethel Home.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:16.550
The headquarters of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society, a center of New World Action, the building from which the work of Jehovah's Witnesses is directed.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:32.550
Bethel means the House of God, and in this house are the Watchtower's President's Office and Staff, its editorial department, legal department, treasures office, and the studios of the Society's radio station WBBR.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.550
It's in this building that many of the things are written that Jehovah's Witnesses use in their gospel preaching.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.550
Visitors are always welcome, and many come to see what is done in this place.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:57.550
Bethel is located on a quiet street in a pleasant neighborhood. The receptionist in the lobby is always glad to greet those who are interested in the Watchtower's activity, and will arrange to show them through the Bethel Home.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:14.019
500 Christian Ministers live here. They spend their lives serving you, devoting all their time to publishing the Bibles and Bible Literature used worldwide by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:25.990
Taking an elevator to Bethel's tenth floor, we see the President's Office, where matters of worldwide importance in gospel preaching activity are handled.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:37.990
At his desk, the Society's President, Brother Nor, gives his secretary, Brother Henshel, some dictophone recordings with letters of Christian instruction for the Society's branches.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:47.990
Brother Nor makes a call, and Brother Henshel, also a director of the Watchtower Society, passes the records to the brother who will type them.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:06:08.500
All work in harmony and unity, for everyone here is concerned with the advancement of praise to Jehovah's Name. For the smooth operation of this efficient preaching organization, the Society's President must keep in constant contact with the various departments.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:20.500
As, in this instance, where he contacts Brother Souter, the Society's Secretary and Treasurer, regarding the contract for the Yankee Stadium Assembly in 1953,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:36.410
Brother Souter is going to have some clause in it checked by the legal department. Brother Rimmer, another Society Director, is here counter-signing the checks that pay for supplies.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:46.410
Even with very careful buying, the cost of the supplies needed for the millions of publications used by Jehovah's Witnesses every year is very great.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:57.110
Much of this expense is covered by voluntary contributions, also handled here.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:06.779
Now the contract is sent to the legal department, where the Society's legal counsel, Brother Covington, will check the matter.

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:16.779
The legal department is continually concerned with the fight for free worship, giving you the right to hear the truth and to tell it to others.

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:33.779
A legal fight for this right to freedom of worship has been necessary in many lands, because opposers are determined that this good news shall not be preached, while Jehovah's Witnesses are even more determined that, by God's undeserved kindness it shall.

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:46.910
Amazing things, these, but it is Jehovah's Spirit that makes them possible. It is His work, not man's.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:52.910
Information on a victory for free worship is sent down to the editorial offices on the 8th floor.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:08:02.790
Sketches for awake illustrations are being considered when the material from the legal department arrives and is taken care of.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:19.730
The brother who will point to the illustrations and page the leaves of the magazine has just fixed up the dummy, which shows where each article in illustration will go in a forthcoming issue of awake.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:30.290
Meanwhile, the material from the legal office is to be put into article form for the benefit of awake readers throughout the world.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:52.980
So the news clipping desks voluminous files of clippings and articles are referred to, and this material is taken to the writing offices by one of the brothers who will prepare the article and submit it for approval.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:59.980
The Society's 3,250 book library is used in connection with the editorial department.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:06.980
Here in the evenings, the members of the Bethel family, both brothers and sisters, may do their studying.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:13.980
The reference works available here provide up to date information for lively, informative, Bible lectures.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.980
This is merely an enlarged version of the ministry school library that you should have at your kingdom hall.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:38.580
Also in the evening, back in the editorial department, some watched our manuscripts have been measured for space, considered for illustrations, and are put into an envelope that we follow the next morning to the Society's factory at 117 Adam Street.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:52.909
Here we shall see how a watchtower is made. The manuscript envelope is delivered to the United States Branch Servant, Brother Larson, who is also a Society Director.

00:09:52.909 --> 00:10:00.909
He is in charge of the factory's operation and must see that this material is printed and mailed out on time.

00:10:00.909 --> 00:10:10.909
Brother Larson gives the manuscript to the Dispatch Servant, who must see to it that each issue of the magazines and other publications move through the factory on schedule.

00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:14.909
The Dispatch Servant takes the manuscript to the proofreaders.

00:10:14.909 --> 00:10:43.179
The proofreaders must check to see that the spelling, punctuation, and grammar are perfect, and when they are finished the material is returned to the Dispatch Desk and sent on its way to the Linatite department on the 7th floor.

00:10:43.179 --> 00:11:02.179
Here it is set up in type on one of these 13 type-setting machines. Publications containing the Kingdom message can here be set in any language using Roman characters, and also in Greek, Hebrew, Yiddish, Russian, Ukrainian, Arabic, and Armenian.

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:09.179
Brother Fekil in charge of this department is also a Director of one of the Society's corporations.

00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:17.179
There is no exalted position among such Christian brothers. Society directors work here just like anyone else.

00:11:17.179 --> 00:11:27.179
Brother Fekil is on the extreme left, working on this type that has now been arranged into pages and locked up in metal frames called chases.

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:39.179
This type could now be used on small presses, but for the society's fast rotary presses a curved metal plate must be made, in the way that we shall now see.

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:51.490
First an impression or mold is made by placing a fiber mat on top of the type. Then some soft blankets.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:58.490
Then all this is put under a hydraulic press that stamps the shape of the type right into the fiber mat.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:10.950
As this is done, a completed mat comes out at the left. The mat is then put into the curved casting box which you see here.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:22.950
And molten metal made up of antimony, lead, and tin is poured into the box, where it flows into the impressions that the original flat type made on the now curved mat.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:33.580
While the metal is setting, a curved molded plate that has already cooled can be taken out of the other casting box.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:45.620
This is done. The mat is taken off, and you can see the surface of the type on the curved metal plate.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:55.620
The high spots that might print black on blank parts of the page are routed off, so that the only thing that remains on the plate is the type printing surface.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:09.139
The plate is now prepared to the proper thickness. Then put into the nickel tank where one and a half thousands of an inch of nickel makes the plate surface very hard.

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:17.139
The plate is then complete, ready to use, and is put onto a wagon and sent downstairs to the presses.

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:30.139
But in order to print, we must first have ink, and here you see Brother Swingle, another society director, who handles the department that makes ink, paste, glue, and press rollers.

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:38.139
Another brother shows how the ingredients are mixed and ground on an ink mill until their texture is velvety smooth.

00:13:39.139 --> 00:13:48.139
About 50 tons of ink are made in a year, both black and colors, add a tremendous saving over its commercial cost.

00:13:48.139 --> 00:14:03.919
Good work is done by these brothers, for the words printed with this very ink may mean life to their readers.

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:10.919
Now the plates that we saw made on the seventh floor are put on the Watchtower magazine press on the sixth floor.

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:26.919
Soon the ink rolls will be moved into place to supply ink to the type, and with the starting of the press we shall have seen the different steps that must be taken with the Watchtower as it goes through the various departments is set in type and finally printed.

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:36.919
Watchtower circulation has grown from 40,040 years ago, to 1,825,000 today.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:55.299
This press works the year round on just the English language Watchtower, and one day's production of Watchtower magazines, if laid end to end, would stretch 40 miles.

00:14:55.299 --> 00:15:14.659
Here is the publication of the New World Society. Jehovah has fed us through its pages, and he will continue to do so. The rough edges are trimmed off, then these Watchtowers will be addressed and mailed.

00:15:14.659 --> 00:15:30.470
But in order for them to be mailed, we must have subscriptions and orders for the distributors copies, so we go back to the ninth floor office, where the mail is being distributed to the various desks.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:49.129
In the service department, mail is handed to Brother Sullivan, another society director, who has oversight over this department that handles correspondence with the circuit and district servants, and in general looks after the pioneers and congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:15:49.129 --> 00:16:07.309
The subscription slips are received by correspondence desks and passed to the magazine department. This address will be copied on a graphite type machine, which impresses it into a metal stencil.

00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:18.309
These small metal address stencils being typed here are used both as the record of the subscription and to stamp the subscribers' address on each of his magazines.

00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:32.860
11 graphite machines are needed to type these stencils, which are then filed in metal cabinets. Each cabinet holds 35,000 address stencils.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:40.860
Here are 1,100,000 addresses of people who regularly receive the society's magazines.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:59.769
Is your address here? The magazines, as you see here, are sent to many places. These trays hold address stencils for China, Burma, Spain, Switzerland, Cyprus, Australia, France.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:15.740
In fact, watchtower and awake circulation literally girls the globe. These addresses are stamped on rolls of paper which are cut apart in a hand machine and pasted on the magazines.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:23.740
Or the magazines are addressed and wrapped by machine and then bundled and put into mailbags to go to all parts of the world.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:37.299
These bags containing watchtower and awake magazines for tens of thousands of subscribers are stacked on skids to be taken to the trucks at loading platforms on the first floor.

00:17:37.299 --> 00:17:59.829
Here books are being readied for delivery to steamship or freight lines and still writing on the skids or wooden platforms. The bags full of magazines are loaded onto one of the society's four large trucks for delivery to the post office.

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:13.500
For shipping such quantities of literature, the society's factory is in an ideal location, being situated in the heart of one of the world's great transportation centers.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:30.500
The society's trucks delivered their magazines to the post office and have now gone to a nearby railroad siding to get paper for the factory, a great amount of paper is necessary on which to print the books and magazines that tell of the glorious kingdom message.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:44.500
For freight carloads of paper about 100 tons are received each week, loaded on the society's trucks and transported to the factory where we shall see a part of this being unloaded.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:19:03.500
This roll of paper is 59 inches wide, weighs 1,500 pounds, is five miles long and will last just 40 minutes on the press, during which time it will be turned into approximately 15,000 awake magazines.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:12.029
The operators of all this equipment are Jehovah's Witnesses. They all learned this work after coming to Bethel.

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:25.029
They are Christian ministers from many places who have become skilled as efficient line of type operators, truckers, pressmen and binders, so the kingdom message can be printed at minimum cost.

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:34.470
They consider this printing just as important as is the House to House Ministry, in which they also regularly engage.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:45.470
They know that for every extra 60 seconds that this press stands idle, 450 copies of awake will not be produced, that could have been made that day.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:57.579
So almost quicker than it takes to tell it, they have the old roll off, the new on and the press starts rolling again.

00:19:57.579 --> 00:20:10.269
From above you can see how the 59 inch roll is printed, cut into strips and these laid over each other so that the pages will fall at the right place when the magazine is folded.

00:20:10.269 --> 00:20:17.269
Awake now has a circulation of 1,250,000 copies in 13 languages.

00:20:17.269 --> 00:20:28.269
Issues in two languages, English and Spanish are printed on this press, two on other presses in this factory and the other languages are printed in other lands.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:43.220
The watchtower in awake are having a great part in preaching the good news of the kingdom.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:49.220
While awake is published in 13 languages, the watchtower is in 40.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:58.220
Included here are German, Portuguese, Ilocano, Slovak, Danish and Tui.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:06.220
Through these magazines in all these languages, the spiritual meat and due season is being provided worldwide.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:23.740
The magazines in languages that have a smaller circulation of around 5 to 10,000 copies an issue are printed on slower flatbed presses, in large flat sheets that are then folded into complete magazines.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:43.779
Smaller printing is done on job presses, which turn out millions of copies of such things as hand bills, tracts, informants, subscription slips, letterheads and the like.

00:21:43.779 --> 00:21:54.779
The 90,100,000 public meeting hand bills that this department produced in 1953 would make a stacked five and a half miles high.

00:21:54.779 --> 00:22:11.619
A great portion of the society's press room, including the part you see here, is used for the printing of the books, booklets and bibles.

00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:16.619
These are printed in 32-page sections called signatures.

00:22:16.619 --> 00:22:33.720
The signatures come out of the press that you see on the right and are tied in bundles until all the books parts are printed, and then it can be bound.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:45.720
Twelve of these 32-page book sections must be printed to make one copy of New Heavens and a New Earth, 27 for a New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:55.720
The bundles of signatures are put on a conveyor that carries them to a circular shoot, down which they slide two stories to the binary on the fourth floor.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:06.720
The book, Let God Be True, is made up of ten of these signatures, and now has a circulation of twelve and a half million in thirty-one languages.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:19.420
The thousands of persons who have come to a knowledge of the truth from it will realize the value of the work that their fellow members of the New World Society here are doing.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:28.420
When these pictures were made, the factory was reprinting the book, this means everlasting life, which is composed of ten sections.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.420
These are here stacked up behind the gathering machine.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:41.130
This machine has pockets for each of the signatures or sections of the book.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:54.130
Its steel fingers drop one signature at a time on a moving conveyor, adding each succeeding 32-page section until all the parts for the complete book are stacked in order.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:24:00.130
If it should pick up two signatures or miss one, the machine will automatically stop.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:11.980
Then in the sewing department, the signatures are sewed together. Each of these nine machines will sew up to four thousand books a day.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:31.009
Unusual is the Watchtower Society's efficient method of printing two books on the same signature, and not cutting them apart until after they are sewed, thus increasing the production to about four million books a year.

00:24:32.009 --> 00:24:40.009
After being cut apart, the books are put into a rotary trimmer, where the rough edges can be trimmed off of ten million pages a day.

00:24:40.009 --> 00:24:53.900
Then the books come to the gluing machine, where the backs of eight books at a time are passed over a cylinder that turns in glue.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:00.900
A next go to the rounder, where the backbone, which is the part of the book that faces you on a shelf, is rounded.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.900
This permits it to open easily and to lie flat when opened on a table.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:15.789
The book is then put into the backliner where some cloth called crash is glued on, to make a hint strong enough to hold the cover.

00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:22.789
And finally, a heavy piece of paper is put on the back to keep the glue from soaking through in warm weather.

00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:40.460
Next, the covers are pasted on the book in this casing-in machine. The covers were made in the case maker.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:49.460
It glues hard boards on a long strip of cover material, and cuts and folds these into the completed covers that come out of the right end of the machine.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:58.059
With this one operation, the covers are complete, except that they do not yet have the title on them.

00:25:58.059 --> 00:26:06.059
The covers are taken from the case maker to the embosser, where the title of the book is stamped into the covers with gold foil.

00:26:06.059 --> 00:26:13.059
Here a stack of covers is put in at one end of the embosser, and the brother will take the embossed covers out of the other end.

00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:25.140
Back now to the casing-in machine, where these covers are being put on the books.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:38.140
From here the books go to the standing presses, where they are stacked between boards to be held under pressure for six to eight hours, until the paste that holds the cover on is thoroughly dried.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:45.140
The book is held under pressure for this length of time by iron rods put on both sides of the press.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:54.430
After the books are thoroughly dry, they're inspected, then packed directly into cartons.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:27:15.690
This means everlasting life here being packed has already reached a circulation of four million in sixteen languages, giving countless multitudes the opportunity to learn the course that does lead to life, and how they should live today.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:24.690
After being packed into cartons, the books go down to the shipping department on the second floor, where orders are filled for all parts of the world.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:38.690
In an average month, nearly ten thousand cartons of Bible literature weighing some four hundred thousand pounds will be shipped from here, in addition to thousands of smaller parcel-post packages and local shipments.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:48.690
Shipping is a major item, for to some places it costs as much as two dollars and sixty cents to send one of these cartons of sixty-bound books.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:57.690
The society's factory, however, being within sight of Earth's busiest port, is in the best location in the world for such shipping.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:12.210
Why is all this shipping necessary? Because of your activity in the New World Society. To keep this large factory running, many things, of course, are necessary.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:24.210
The brothers who work in the machine and the electrical shops give good care to the expensive machinery that must be used in such extensive printing, and this care gives it a long life.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:35.940
The plant's electricity is produced by this 525 horsepower diesel engine and generator.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:51.940
Its power runs all the equipment you have seen in this building, and from the factory's lobby, visitors can view this final example of how, here, everything possible is done to save on expenses, even to the point of producing the plant's own electricity.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:29:06.420
As these visitors transact their business with the society, we note that it is now supper time, and the brothers who have been working hard all day are leaving the factory, which is situated in a very prominent place in Brooklyn.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:21.420
And are walking the few blocks to the Bethel home. We are glad that we had the opportunity of visiting this place and of seeing how the publications that brought us the truth are produced, and how our brothers worked diligently to provide this literature for us.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:33.259
As we walked toward Bethel, we find that these brothers often hurry, looking forward to their evening meal and to study or service that evening.

00:29:33.259 --> 00:29:46.660
After their evening's activity and a good night's rest, we see them coming down to breakfast the next morning.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:30:01.660
At the breakfast table, in a procedure followed by all the Bethel families throughout the world, they first enjoy the spiritual food of the daily scripture text and comments, which are discussed for 15 to 20 minutes each morning.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:07.660
After this, one member of the family represents them in prayer, and then they have their breakfast.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:20.099
Preparing some 1,500 meals a day for this family of 500 persons is a big job, and food is a major item.

00:30:20.099 --> 00:30:28.099
However, its cost is kept to a minimum by having much of it raised by brothers who work on the society's several farms.

00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:39.759
Such matters as farm production and the purchasing of food are handled by the Bethel office.

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:47.759
Brother Ulrich, also a director of one of the society's corporations, is here handling food and supply records.

00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:53.759
Additionally, these brothers see to such matters as the cleanliness and general operation of the Bethel home.

00:30:53.759 --> 00:31:09.180
Sisters who are members of this family also do good work, dusting the rooms, washing the sinks, cleaning the windows, and generally keeping this place neat and clean.

00:31:11.779 --> 00:31:23.779
For the convenience of this big family, there is a tailor shop that does cleaning and pressing work for a small charge, enabling the brothers to make a neat appearance as representatives of the Theocratic organization.

00:31:23.779 --> 00:31:45.309
A sister does alterations of clothes. A brother takes care of the hairdressing and barbering, and other brothers do shoe repairs for the Bethel family, repairing about 75 pairs of shoes each week.

00:31:45.309 --> 00:31:56.069
Then there is the laundry, where the shirts and socks, the linen and bed sheets, the towels and pillowcases are kept clean and spotless.

00:31:56.069 --> 00:32:07.859
Bethel is run like a very large hotel would be if such a place as a hotel could have the spirit and family unity of Christian love.

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:22.109
Since so many clothes could not be hung up to dry, machines use centrifugal force to throw the water out as they whirl the clothes dry.

00:32:22.109 --> 00:32:33.109
The sheets, pillowcases, towels and other things are ironed on large machines, put in proper order and sent to the supply rooms for use on the various floors.

00:32:33.109 --> 00:32:42.109
All is efficient, nothing is wasted. Having this equipment enables more work to be done and money actually is saved.

00:32:42.109 --> 00:32:54.109
How would you, for instance, like to iron 1,500 shirts a week? Or perhaps darn the socks and repair the clothes for 500 of your Christian brothers?

00:32:54.109 --> 00:33:02.109
Yes, all these things and many more must be done so that this family may most efficiently serve their brothers throughout the world,

00:33:02.109 --> 00:33:15.099
aiding in the praise of Jehovah's name. As the day goes on we find that appetites increase and the new meal that the cooks have been working on all morning must be served.

00:33:15.099 --> 00:33:21.099
At meal times the entire home and factory close down so that all the brothers may eat together.

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:31.730
The kitchen is well equipped, even having its own bakery which produces 400 loaves of bread a week and prepares excellent pastry.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:56.880
Good wholesome food is prepared for the Bethel family works hard and has a healthy appetite. The cooks are preparing chicken for dinner. These were raised on the society's farm.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:11.739
While they're doing this others are cleaning and preparing the vegetables. Also in the Bethel home is another instrument used in the gospel preaching.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:26.940
The studios of the society's radio station WBBR. The announcer introduces a program signals the control room and this Bible study group is now on the air.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:38.510
Studying for the benefit of the radio audience, the book, New Heavens and a New Earth. Similar studies are put on throughout the week.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:58.619
The broadcasting transmitter which we shall visit is about 25 miles away at the society's property on Staten Island. Many persons have heard the Kingdom message and have come to a knowledge of the truth as a result of this station's broadcasts and the work of the brothers who operated.

00:34:58.619 --> 00:35:03.619
The voices from Brooklyn go through the broadcasting equipment here.

00:35:03.619 --> 00:35:16.619
And are thrown out over the air with 5,000 watts power to serve a tremendous audience of some 15 and a half million people with the good news that God's Kingdom is for man's benefit.

00:35:16.619 --> 00:35:37.880
The executive department of the Watchtower Society has its study here at Staten Island. And here we find brother friends, the society's vice president, looking up certain information and preparing scriptural articles for publication.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:53.619
The research is careful and thorough, the information reliable and authoritative. A special reference library is here used in connection with this message of the New World.

00:35:53.619 --> 00:36:16.429
So we leave WBBR's 411 foot high transmission towers at Staten Island, towers whose invisible waves carry a message of life and return to Bethel, where a Watchtower organ broadcast is originating.

00:36:17.429 --> 00:36:32.429
This auditorium studio is also used as a Kingdom Hall, and just before the great Yankee Stadium Assembly in 1953, it was the scene of a meeting of Watchtower branch servants from the four corners of the globe.

00:36:32.429 --> 00:36:43.429
Branch servants from 65 lands and representatives from even other countries presented problems encountered in missionary work, and these were ironed out by the society's president.

00:36:43.429 --> 00:37:01.070
Many of these branch servants had graduated from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, where, as at Bethel, visitors are always welcome.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:12.070
Located in the Highlands above Lake Cauga, 250 miles northwest of New York City, this school is devoted to training missionaries promoting Christian education.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:28.349
The day at Gilead, as at all of the Watchtower's homes, begins with the students and the farm family assembling in the dining room for consideration of the daily scripture text.

00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:37.349
Questions are offered regarding the text, and comments are given by members of this family who are called upon at random by the one at the head of the table.

00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:44.349
Thus the minds of all are alerted since all must be on their toes prepared to answer.

00:37:44.349 --> 00:38:03.059
Others may then volunteer comments, and the matter is summed up by reading what the yearbook says about the text.

00:38:03.059 --> 00:38:07.820
We hurry along now with one of the classes.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:18.550
This is Classroom D in the Library Building, where these brothers are studying the promises of God's Word, the fundamental doctrines of the Bible.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:33.460
On nice days, the public speaking session is often held in very pleasant surroundings, out by the fish pond in the little amphitheater that was built by the students and the farm family.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:41.460
After the regular classes are completed, the students assemble in the main auditorium where they are here learning about prayer wheels.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:50.460
A number of the brothers here will work with the New World Society and lands where these are used, so they're learning what the people believe about such things.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:54.460
In order that the truth may be properly presented to them.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:39:03.179
Many matters are here discussed, including the true religion concerning Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.

00:39:03.179 --> 00:39:17.650
In the lounge at the far side of the room is a picture of each class that has graduated from the school and gone on to foreign lands.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:26.650
After their classes are over, the students are not yet through for the day. They help on various jobs at the school or around the farm.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:42.650
Perhaps assisting with the milking of the excellent dairy herd that provides dairy products for the feeding of the brothers, both here and in Brooklyn, or perhaps working in the gardens, or helping with the cheese making and storage, which cheese storage you see here.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:58.110
These Christian ministers are busy people. In the evenings they must still study their lessons, do research and prepare their discourses.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:11.110
In this, the 9,000-volume library is of great value. The wisdom and knowledge available here are spread around the world as these brothers go to missionary assignments in all parts of the globe.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:21.809
Thus, another busy day ends for the Kingdom Farm family and the students of Gilead's 21st Class, who had studied diligently.

00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:33.989
Shortly before their graduation at the great Yankee Stadium Assembly of Jehovah's Witnesses in 1953.

00:40:33.989 --> 00:40:51.989
Were you there? Well over 150,000 people were fortunate enough to be able to attend this glorious eight-day New World Society Assembly of Jehovah's Witnesses in Yankee Stadium, New York, July 19th through 26th 1953.

00:40:51.989 --> 00:41:06.989
From the world around they came, from more than 90 lands, and ahead of them they had sent their greetings which were depicted in vivid colors on these large banners all the way around both levels of the inside of the stadium.

00:41:06.989 --> 00:41:19.989
From Norway and Mexico and Argentina, happy people had come. From the world's four corners they had gathered to consider God's Word and to declare themselves for His New World.

00:41:19.989 --> 00:41:31.039
Our Christian brothers from many lands had assembled in this one place without controversy, with none of the quarreling and greed of the old world.

00:41:31.039 --> 00:41:48.039
These people had one purpose, one mind. They were people of all races and colors, formerly of all creeds, from all nations and kindreds and tongues, but united in service to Jehovah, in the bond of love and Christian brotherhood.

00:41:48.039 --> 00:42:01.039
These people came from the ends of the earth just to hear the truth, just to hear Jehovah's Word expounded. Their joy and happiness showed the spirit that will be evident in the New World.

00:42:01.039 --> 00:42:10.039
Only the power of Jehovah God could accomplish such unity as was evident among the happy people from many lands that you see here.

00:42:10.039 --> 00:42:32.260
Truly, this was an outstanding example of the New World Society in action. What did they see and do here?

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:43.260
The program outlined in this attractive booklet showed that the first day would include the graduation of the 21st Class of Gilead, the one that we just visited.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:58.260
The sky was clear, the sun was bright, anticipation was high. Attention was immediately grasped by the beauty of the platform, so excellently arranged on what was normally a baseball playing field.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:12.179
The 127 Gilead graduates and the 126,000 others in attendance were addressed by the school's instructors, and then by the society's president, Brother Nor.

00:43:12.179 --> 00:43:26.579
One of the most stirring sites of the graduation was when all the graduates of former classes who were in the audience were asked to stand.

00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:41.579
These were faithful ministers who had participated in the growth of the New World Society in their area, sometimes from a small handful to many thousands during the less than 11 years since Gilead's first class had begun.

00:43:41.579 --> 00:43:52.579
Of the 1600 missionary graduates from Gilead who are now in the field, this 945 had been able to come in from the field, which is the world.

00:43:53.579 --> 00:44:19.190
Just look at the number of them who are there. This fine example of faithfulness in their assignment was set before the graduating 21st Class, here seated on the field at each end of the wide platform.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:32.690
From this beautiful platform, the great shepherding work was discussed, and it was pointed out that it isn't hard to identify the false shepherds or the true ones today.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:42.690
Brother Franz, the society's vice president, admonished the graduates to fully accomplish their ministry and to show Christian love in their assignments.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:54.690
After receiving this good admonition, the students filed up to receive their assignments in their diplomas, and to learn where they would be sent in the world to continue their ministerial activity.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:45:13.690
Brother Schroeder, the registrar of Gilead, assisted Brother Nore in issuing the diplomas to students from 28 lands, who would go to 44 countries, to Europe and Africa, Asia and Latin America, and Jehovah's rich blessing would be with them.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:21.690
Indeed, it was a joyful time, full of keen anticipation of marvelous blessings in the service of the Creator.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:37.489
In the evening, the students told of life at Gilead, and entertained with a pleasant program of songs from their native lands. The first day ended and the next came.

00:45:37.489 --> 00:45:51.489
The great resolution went on record before God and all men. With the declaration that Jehovah's Witnesses are one united, new world society, and will abide firmly by its godly principles.

00:45:51.489 --> 00:46:04.090
The new witnessing aid, make sure of all things, was released to a most enthusiastic audience, and Yankee Stadium was a scene of great rejoicing,

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:11.090
as Jehovah's Witnesses determined to use this new aid zealously in all their ministry.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:25.820
The audience's enthusiasm is manifest in these happy faces. Of course, between the assembly's sessions, material food was also necessary.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:35.820
So as they examined, make sure of all things, these brothers were on their way to the convention's cafeteria, which was indeed an amazing place.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:53.679
4,500 brothers volunteered to operate this most efficient feeding arrangement, which served literally tens of thousands of meals each day. The food was good, the cost reasonable, the appetite's healthy ones.

00:46:53.679 --> 00:47:15.860
From thirty-eight such serving lines, the food was carried to the tables provided in the next tent. The brothers in the large and efficient kitchen worked hard to get everything ready on time,

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:26.219
and after eating in the cafeteria, the conventioneers returned to the stadium for more spiritual food.

00:47:26.219 --> 00:47:39.260
Tuesday morning there were meetings of the society's circuit, branch, and public relations servants.

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:53.260
And in the afternoon, Brother Norr released, preach the word, a thirty-two-page booklet containing the kingdom message in thirty languages, so that any Christian minister could witness in any major tongue.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:48:13.880
Of course, English was not the native language of many in attendance, so meetings were held in various parts of the stadium, on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings in twenty other languages.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:28.889
Armenian, Greek, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and other tongues. At the Greek meeting a new Bible aid was released.

00:48:28.889 --> 00:48:43.059
Just one of the seventy-five made available during this assembly. Another outstanding Tuesday joy was hearing Brother Fran speak on the Theocratic organization.

00:48:46.659 --> 00:49:06.659
Wednesday morning a large crowd was on hand to hear the nine o'clock discourse on baptism. These four thousand six hundred and forty new Christian ministers, sixteen hundred more than were baptized at Pentecost, arose to indicate that they would this day symbolize the dedication of their lives to Jehovah.

00:49:07.659 --> 00:49:32.659
With heads bowed in earnest prayer, this is the multitude that would be immersed. In an orderly manner, appropriate for members of the New World Society, immersion candidates walked out to the sidewalk to board the special buses that operated a constant shuttle service to the immersion pool.

00:49:32.659 --> 00:49:44.099
Baptism is an important act for the Christian, and one must be completely dipped under the water, just as Jesus was immersed in the Jordan River.

00:49:45.099 --> 00:50:02.659
These people have studied God's word, accepted the truth, and now want to prove their appreciation by obeying Jehovah's instructions and dedicating their lives to Him. Such a baptism indeed amazed the neighborhood.

00:50:02.659 --> 00:50:09.659
Of special interest to those watching was the non-nationalistic aspect of this spectacle.

00:50:09.659 --> 00:50:28.260
Persons of many national backgrounds were represented. Many of the amazed onlookers watched from their rooftops and fire escapes, and noted the great difference in age of those baptized, thus seeing that true religion draws youths as well as older men.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:47.610
The act of being dipped has no value unless the one being baptized has dedicated his life to Jehovah.

00:50:47.610 --> 00:51:04.610
But when he has made that dedication, he should be immersed as an outward symbol that this dedication has been made. Of those immersed, 1,861 were men. 2,779 were women.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:18.090
Another outstanding assembly provision was the New World Society Trailer City, 40 miles away near Dunnell and New Jersey.

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:31.090
The convention is still on, but everything that happens at Yankee Stadium can also be heard out here. Clearly, but unobtrusively, the strains of fine music flow through the air.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:39.090
Then the voices of speakers who dwell calmly but eloquently upon Bible teachings that have to do with life and good works.

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:51.090
Large, loud speakers in the city's two sections can be heard no matter where you are, whether in your trailer or tent, or at the space set aside for the audience to sit.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:52:05.820
Amazingly, most of this orderly city sprang up practically in one day. 20,000 persons moved in within twelve hours, and that is one every three seconds.

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:28.929
A grocery man, who supplied much of the city's food, said, I can sense the difference the minute I turn off the highway. And indeed you could. All necessary facilities were provided.

00:52:28.929 --> 00:52:37.929
The city was operated entirely by volunteers, and it even had its own fire department, which was used mainly to water down the streets.

00:52:37.929 --> 00:52:54.710
Cafeteria boilers, shower buildings, and other facilities had been set up, the labor having been volunteered by Jehovah's Witnesses who live in the area.

00:52:54.710 --> 00:53:04.710
Yes, many things were needed. In this tent, even a well-staffed, first aid department was at hand to take care of any difficulties or illnesses.

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:20.309
The food and other supplies for this big city had been ordered and arranged for long in advance, and at the moment they were needed, they came in by the truckload.

00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:43.550
Good planning made everything available at just the right time. Here are some of the trucks that were in trailer city at one time. In the hot weather, perhaps handing the city's supply of ice had its advantages.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:54:08.670
At the two well-stocked grocery stores, food was available at a reduced cost. Even the children, though typically energetic, were quietly subdued. They were listening, talking, learning, quietly playing with one another, occasionally getting tired and going to sleep.

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:24.670
The grocery man who commented on the city's orderliness said, no loud noise, no routiness, no harshness. You come away realizing you just visited a big city without hearing one harsh sound in it.

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:48.829
That is something, he said. That is a modern-day miracle. The interest of all these earnest people was centered around the good message coming from Yankee Stadium. Indeed, this Christian gathering produced some city.

00:54:48.829 --> 00:55:19.619
Built to last just a little more than a week, it gives some idea of what Jehovah's Witnesses can do after Armageddon, being able to live almost anywhere. To move from one section to another, or to assemble in small groups, they built and operated the entire city, harvesting the wheat that had stood on this land, laying out the streets, putting in the plumbing, the kitchens, taking care of any who were sick.

00:55:19.619 --> 00:55:42.670
As Isaiah 32-18 puts it, these people abode in a peaceable habitation, in safe dwellings and in quiet resting places. Among these Christians, policemen were unnecessary. Only traffic directors were needed, and even these were Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:55:42.670 --> 00:56:10.579
At a speed of 120 miles an hour, we're flying by this outstanding example of the New World Society in action. That 45,000 people could dwell together in such a city in unity, with no wrangling or fighting, nor any need of force to keep the peace, can be accomplished only when Jehovah's Spirit is backing them up as it is doing here.

00:56:10.579 --> 00:56:25.510
And so we return the 40 miles to Yankee Stadium where the program continues. Again, the stadium is packed to capacity to hear the Watchtower's president speak on,

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:39.510
walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever. He showed the shortcomings of the new revised standard version Bible, its omission of the name Jehovah, and the importance of that name.

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:57.510
This discourse concluded with announcement to his audience of volume one of the New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, which is now being widely used along with the Christian Greek Scriptures translation, made available in this same stadium in 1950.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:09.369
Brother Henshel showed that this is the day Jehovah provided for a great crowd to hear the truth and be saved. Did we say, hear it?

00:57:09.369 --> 00:57:31.579
Well, even those who could not hear with their ears could see these good words. In Brother Covington's long to be remembered discourse, he likened his vast audience to lawyers who are teaching God's law to men of good will, faithful ministers who stick to their territory.

00:57:31.579 --> 00:57:47.880
Brother Schroeder reminded that Jehovah's Witnesses have a common faith, a common feeding program through the Watchtower magazine, and are under the leadership of our reigning king Christ Jesus.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:58:07.039
Then Brother Franz striking Thursday discourse. New World Society attacked from the far north, forcefully sounded the alarm of Armageddon. As the days passed on, many new publications were released.

00:58:07.039 --> 00:58:24.090
These were some of them. This was climaxed on Saturday with release of the thrilling New English book, New Heavens and a New Earth. A tremendous amount of advertising was done.

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:55.010
5,100,000 handbills were used, 205,000 of these lapel tags. There were 160 signs on the highways, and the big signs on Yankee Stadium. New York City was impressed, and Sunday, July 26, New Yorkers came by the tens of thousands for this was the climactic day, inside anticipation was growing high.

00:58:55.010 --> 00:59:06.010
Under the warm sun, every seat was taken. No more could be allowed in the stands, but there were still thousands more who would not be disappointed.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:24.010
The gates were opened, and with the women removing their high-heeled shoes so they would not ruin the turf, 7,500 more persons flooded in, in an orderly manner, to sit on the playing field and hear the warning of Armageddon and the hope of the New World.

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:43.360
That so many were anxious to hear of God's way brought a great stir throughout the audience. Then a mighty roar of enthusiasm. It was indeed a happy time of prosperity for Zion, a sight never to be forgotten.

00:59:43.360 --> 01:00:00.639
This was a result of kingdom preaching. 4 o'clock came and the speech began. 91,562 persons were in the stadium.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:19.659
74,267 more listened from the surrounding tents and from trailer city, making a total of more than 165,000, and an unnumbered multitude listened over radio station WBBR.

01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:26.659
Brother Nor appealed solely to sober judgment. To his attentive audience he explained,

01:00:26.659 --> 01:00:38.659
Armageddon will be the worst thing to hit the earth within the history of man. God's New World will be the best thing ever to come to distressed mankind and will never pass away.

01:00:38.659 --> 01:00:49.579
The New World's King Christ Jesus will provide a home worthy of his family, a paradise of health and life.

01:00:49.579 --> 01:01:01.579
This privileged audience heard scriptural proof of these divine promises, and you can read it for yourself in the printed copy of this inspiring talk, this booklet.

01:01:01.579 --> 01:01:15.550
After Armageddon, God's New World. A great multitude had here spent eight days in New World living, yet they were still to see much more.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:32.710
During the three days following the assembly, more than 15,000 of these brothers visited the society's Brooklyn plant, the place where the message of the New World is printed and sent to all parts of the earth.

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:45.710
Quite extensive construction is underway near the factory for a highway, park, and civic center, and in this reconstructed area, this factory will make a good appearance for the New World's society.

01:01:45.710 --> 01:02:03.730
The visitors then walked a few blocks to the Bethel home, this ten-story red brick building, with a large watchtower atop it, and its back to the lower Manhattan skyline and the East River.

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:11.730
The visitors were thrilled with what they saw, and the neighborhood marveled at the good Christian conduct of Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:21.840
In three days, 15,418 visitors came through the doors of this home and were indeed made welcome.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:40.239
They witnessed the tranquility and peace of this place, where Christian love prevails, and the society was glad to have them visit here. This is the lounge on the first floor.

01:02:40.239 --> 01:02:50.239
The stairway leads up to WBBR's observation room. Visitors are generally ushered to this lounge to see someone at Bethel.

01:02:50.239 --> 01:03:08.079
Monday nights, the lounge is converted into one of Bethel's seven Theocratic ministry school classrooms. In the society's library, members of the Bethel family can do their studying and prepare their talks.

01:03:08.079 --> 01:03:21.969
Here are Bible concordances, dictionaries, commentaries, various translations, and other books on many subjects.

01:03:21.969 --> 01:03:32.969
In the kingdom hall, each Monday evening, the Bethel family assembles to study the watchtower, studying the same lesson that these brothers will have in their congregations the following Sunday.

01:03:32.969 --> 01:03:47.969
Even on as hot an evening as this one was, the Bethel family appreciates the importance of this study. For they know that this spiritual food gives one strength, and that all who are interested in serving Jehovah must follow the scriptural instruction,

01:03:47.969 --> 01:04:10.530
to not forsake the gathering of ourselves together. Visitors also saw WBBR's studios, where Brother Macmillan is reading material from the watchtower.

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:19.530
Then many of them went out across the New York Harbor, past the Statue of Liberty to Staten Island, where the station's transmitters are located.

01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:28.349
Radio station WBBR speaks out boldly, with well rounded out, pleasingly informal programs.

01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:46.349
In New York, where many exclusive apartment house dwellers are beyond the reach of a door to door kingdom publisher, this station's 5,000 watt voice of praise to Jehovah tells its listeners that the troubles of today are signs of the kingdom's establishment.

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:59.000
The brothers who work in the vegetable gardens on the station's grounds produce food that helps to feed the Bethel family, cutting down on costs,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:08.860
so that the Bible literature can be presented to the people at very low contributions. The watchtower society is in no way commercial.

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:18.860
It is philanthropic and educational, and all its parts work together so that this gospel of the kingdom can be preached throughout the world for a witness.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:39.400
Thus, even these vegetables will aid in that proclamation. Many brothers return home by way of the watchtower Bible School of Gilead, and marveled at the campus that has there been developed.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:46.400
It isn't elaborate, but just shows what can be done when a few brothers want to beautify a place.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:06:02.420
Members of the farm family and Gilead students have added improvements and have created what many visitors have described as a sample of the peaceful tranquility of the New World, or a joy that New World will be.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:22.050
With all who are living praising Jehovah, with the spirit of peace and Christian brotherhood extending to all men wherever they live, with Eden's blessings restored to earth, then as the psalmist long ago promised, the earth will indeed yield its full increase.

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:53.159
Then the earth will become a paradise-egg garden. The great creator, the Almighty Jehovah, has promised just such a thing, and the promise is sure, for he is the maker of the heavens and the earth. Eventually, the whole world will be such a garden.

01:06:53.159 --> 01:06:57.159
But first, a great witness work must be completed.

01:06:57.159 --> 01:07:17.159
So by all the means of transportation they had used to come to this New World Society assembly, by seaway, railway, airway, and highway, Jehovah's Witnesses returned to their home territories, to their awakened many more men of goodwill to the old world's end, and the blessings of the New.

01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:28.920
They recognize each meeting at their kingdom halls as a small assembly of the New World Society.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:39.920
Zealous in house-to-house service every Sunday morning, they know that the door-to-door kingdom publisher is the backbone of the New World Society in action.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:49.460
A mature publisher goes along with the newer one in Jehovah's Service, as they call it the door of a modern home in the United States.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:58.460
When the new one becomes proficient, she will take another publisher along with her only occasionally. For much more can be done if each takes a house.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:11.179
The new one makes her own presentation. But when the lady raises a question, the mature publisher comes to the new one's aid by referring to, make sure of all things.

01:08:11.179 --> 01:08:31.699
Its scriptural proof helps overcome the householder's objection. Another group of New World Society representatives finds a man working in his yard, and encounters a certain difficulty.

01:08:31.699 --> 01:08:34.699
Oh, he can't understand English.

01:08:34.699 --> 01:08:46.699
Well, that's all right. We have the kingdom message in his language, too. He can read it right here in the new booklet, Preach the Word. It will present the hope for life.

01:08:46.699 --> 01:08:57.149
You see, this work isn't just of one nation, or one nationality, or one people.

01:08:57.149 --> 01:09:09.149
You can cross seas going to many lands, and there find Jehovah's Witnesses doing the same work, having the same zeal, conducting the same type of assemblies.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:19.149
This, for example, is Wembley Stadium in London, where this August 1951 assembly proved a dynamic stimulus to the practice of pure worship.

01:09:19.149 --> 01:09:25.149
36,000 persons here, heard the lecture, will religion meet the world crisis?

01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:41.010
These are some of the happy people who attended this five-day Christian gathering. This is Frankfurt, Germany, and these are people that Hitler was going to destroy.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:51.010
Yet at this assembly in 1951, 47,000 were in attendance, and 2,373 were baptized.

01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:57.770
Their faith shows none of the apathy of so many of today's churchgoers.

01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:12.770
Apathy doesn't carry you through years of Nazi concentration camps, or make you stand firm in communist lands, or allow you to risk jail as many from Germany's eastern zone did to attend this assembly.

01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:37.180
This is Johannesburg in the Union of South Africa in December 1952, illustrating that the New World Society is in action in many tongues throughout the earth, at this assembly talks in English and Afrikaans, were translated into Zulu and Sasuto, for brothers who speak those languages.

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:42.180
Brother Henshel of the Brooklyn Bethel family here speaks through two interpreters.

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:59.649
Despite rain, shelter was found in the stands, and even when these brothers had to stand outside for as long as an hour waiting for food, never was a word of complaint heard from them.

01:10:59.649 --> 01:11:16.149
In Salisbury, southern Odesia, 250 Europeans met in assembly, and 15,000 Africans, some of whom you see here.

01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:28.149
There were no great stadiums here, so the multitudes reminding us of those who came to isolated places to hear Jesus, gathered out in the open under clear skies to listen to the message.

01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:38.149
That people from many different tribes and all parts of the land could meet with no fighting or bloodshed amazed the Africans, the police, and the Europeans.

01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:43.529
It was taken for granted however by the Christians who were in attendance.

01:11:44.529 --> 01:11:49.529
These witnesses of Jehovah, your Christian brothers, know what they believe.

01:11:49.529 --> 01:11:57.529
Can prove it from the Scriptures, or zealous in their activity, and considered it well worth the effort to come and hear the good message.

01:11:57.529 --> 01:12:27.500
145 persons were in attendance at a European assembly at this hall in Kittwee, northern Odesia, in December 1952, and at the African Assembly at Kittwee an amazing 20,000 were in attendance.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:35.500
Here again, in the heart of Africa there was no stadium, but that didn't stand in the way of these energetic witnesses for Jehovah.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:46.500
They cut enough material from nearby forests to make benches for more than 18,000 people, a quarter of the seating capacity of New York's famed Yankee Stadium.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:58.550
Yet this was not in one of the world's great cities, but in a clearing in Central Africa. How could so many people be accommodated?

01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:14.550
To sleep 8,000 of the conventioneers, the brothers cut many thousands of poles, 30,000 bundles of grass, and built 17 of these sleeping shelters that radiated out from the seating area like great spokes of a wheel.

01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:34.180
Some of these were 700 feet in length. Put yourself in their place. Some of these people rode bicycles for two weeks, traveling more than 500 miles each way.

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:43.180
Others walked four days through an area of wild beasts, then traveled two more by primitive bus to reach this assembly.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:56.310
All of Jehovah's Witnesses should have such a zeal for assemblies. Brother Nor spoke eloquently on, it is time to consider God's way.

01:13:56.310 --> 01:14:08.579
The brother on the right is translating the talk into Cebemba for the benefit of the assembled multitude.

01:14:08.579 --> 01:14:15.579
Another never to be forgotten part of this assembly was the singing of powerful hymns of praise to Jehovah.

01:14:15.579 --> 01:14:33.579
A choir of 1,010 led 18,000 voices. These hymns composed in the native languages by African brothers and sung with genuine zeal for Jehovah, left visitors with tingling spines and with tears of joy in their eyes.

01:14:33.579 --> 01:14:50.840
Lift up your eyes and view the fields, said Jesus, that they are white for harvesting. Today the harvest is great. The restoration of true worship expands to the ends of the earth.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:15:06.840
The New World Society is indeed in action. You can participate and have the zeal of all these people you have seen by associating with Jehovah's Witnesses and the Watchtower Society, through whom Jehovah has provided you with this New World message.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:20.840
So, since it means your very life, take as your everlasting determination the Psalmist vow. Every day will I bless you, and I will praise your name forever and ever.
