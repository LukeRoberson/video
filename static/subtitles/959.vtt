00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.860
What's the next challenge we'll discuss?

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.500
It's a disagreement between elders.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.660
If you're an elder, have you experienced that?

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.660
Were voices raised?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.900
Did tempers flare?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.460
Has a friendship with a fellow elder cooled off?

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.539
Though we rightly expect appointed brothers to be exemplary, the fact is all of us, including

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.980
elders, are still imperfect.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.420
This is in backgrounds, personalities, experience, and opinions can lead to disagreements.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.299
And a disagreement, if not resolved, can disrupt our peace and that of others.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:47.219
In this talk, we'll consider how two elders in the first century, Paul and Barnabas,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.140
sowed and reaped peace.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.140
Let's see how their example can help appointed men today, including all of you dear elders,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.380
to resolve a disagreement.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.299
Please open your Bible with me to Acts chapter 15 and read together, verses 36 to 39.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.299
In the reading, please note the problem that arose between Paul and Barnabas.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.260
That's Acts chapter 15 beginning at verse 36.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.540
After some days Paul said to Barnabas, let us now return and visit the brothers in

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.540
every one of the cities where we proclaim the word of Jehovah to see how they are.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.900
This was determined to take along John, who was called Mark.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.060
Paul, however, was not in favor of taking him along with them, seeing that he had departed

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.180
from them in Pamphilia and had not gone with them to the work.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.659
At this there was a sharp burst of anger so that they separated from each other, and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.500
Barnabas took Mark along and sailed away to Cyprus.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.340
What was the problem?

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.819
These two elders strongly disagreed about whether to take Mark with them on their next missionary

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.579
tour.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.259
Of course, expressing a difference of opinion as not always wrong, verse 7 of this same

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:16.939
chapter reports that the apostles and older men in Jerusalem had an intense discussion

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.580
that led to a good outcome.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.139
But in this case, what resulted?

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.259
Please look again at verse 39.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:30.860
It would be nice to read at this Paul and Barnabas prayed to Jehovah and came to an

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.659
agreement.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:42.379
Sadly though, their discussion on this occasion led to a sharp burst of anger and they separated.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.219
As a result, their friendship was affected by a temporary strain.

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.300
Why do we say temporary?

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.020
It appears that Paul and Barnabas put this matter behind them.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.300
A short time later in Paul's letter to the Galatians, he wrote about Barnabas and the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.139
activity they had enjoyed together and Paul did not bring up their dispute.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:16.379
Also, when Paul later wrote to the Colossians and then to Timothy, Paul spoke well of Mark.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.539
In fact, in Paul's last inspired letter, the second to Timothy, he wrote this, bring

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:25.860
Mark along with you, for he is helpful to me in the ministry.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.379
Yes, it seems that Paul and Barnabas resolved their disagreement.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.580
Now, let's think about that, brothers.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.740
What made that possible?

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.180
It's this.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.580
Long before their disagreement, they had shared together in an exciting ministry.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.819
For years, they were united in what the Bible calls a bond of peace.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.180
So even though their friendship experienced strain, the bond between them was strong, strong

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.060
enough to withstand the stress.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.699
Well, let's bring this to our day.

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:15.860
In the following dramatization, please notice how an elder so's peace.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.540
You know, there's more to the story?

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.180
Phil didn't know just how tense things were between Tim and I.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.339
No idea.

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:29.019
We never talked.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:46.250
I mean, really talked about it until it was too late.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.800
Look, we need to talk.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.000
I think we need to seriously reconsider Phil's qualifications.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You know he's not the type of brother that we have.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Enough.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Enough about Phil.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.600
I know he's your friend.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.600
But the body agreed that friends, he's worked with us for years.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.240
The body decided unanimously that he should know all of us.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.870
You pushed them.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.029
Excuse me.

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.269
It's enough that we have those outside the congregation putting pressure on us.

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:23.870
We do not need more in here.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.779
Seriously?

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:32.500
The conversation, the argument, it was terrible.

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.860
We both said things we didn't mean.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:57.939
And after that, we both handled the situation poorly.

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:19.329
We needed to make things right.

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:26.040
It wasn't easy, but we talked it out.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:33.269
And we made peace with Jehovah's help.

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:38.149
Can you imagine what it would have been like in that cell block if we hadn't?

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:43.350
We finally told Phil the whole story once we were all roommates.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.459
Wow.

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:49.459
Let's go sing.

00:06:52.129 --> 00:07:33.379
Elders, here's the question before all of us now.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:38.579
How can we imitate Paul and Barnabas first?

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:44.779
As elders, we must apply scriptural counsel and our dealings with one another.

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:49.540
In the video, we just saw how imperfection got the better of Tim and Carl.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:58.379
Their body language, choice of words, tone of voice, as Tim put it, the argument was terrible.

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:04.420
But after the dispute, what did those two elders eventually do right?

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.459
They applied scriptural counsel and made peace.

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:14.459
For example, the divine counsel at James chapter 3 and verse 17 reminds all of us to be

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:17.060
peaceable and reasonable.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:22.699
The watchtower once suggested how this could be applied to elders, I quote,

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:29.540
peacemakers modestly express their thoughts and then respectfully listen to those of others.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:36.019
Instead of insisting on his own way, a peacemaker will prayerfully consider his brother's viewpoint.

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:42.779
If no Bible principle is violated, there is usually room for varied points of view.

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:49.220
Experienced overseers know that preserving the peace is more important than getting one's

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.220
own way.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.379
What a beautiful thought.

00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:55.500
So what's our first lesson?

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.460
If we as elders apply scriptural counsel in our dealings with one another, we'll never

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:07.340
allow a difference of opinion to become a cause for animosity.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.419
Romans chapter 12 and verse 10 outlines a second lesson.

00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:14.059
Please open your Bible with me there.

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:20.340
Under inspiration at Romans chapter 12 and verse 10, Paul wrote this,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:29.019
In brotherly love have tender affection for one another, in showing honor to one another

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:31.820
take the lead.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:38.259
Brothers, elders now, before life gets even more difficult, this is what we need to do.

00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:43.460
We need to strengthen love and affection for one another.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:50.100
We can do that by continuing to speak well of our fellow elders in public and in private.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.019
By resisting the urge to talk negatively to other elders about any disagreements that

00:09:55.019 --> 00:10:02.139
arise, and by regularly reflecting on our brothers good qualities and on our past

00:10:02.139 --> 00:10:04.779
service together.

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:10.259
In the video, weren't we happy to see how Tim and Carl imitated Paul and Barnabas

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:12.940
and eventually reaped peace?

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.980
Though not easy, they applied scriptural counsel and resolved their problem.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:25.779
That warm smile on Carl's face, when he showed up at Tim's home, the dessert, perhaps

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:35.019
Tim's favorite pie, the heart to heart talk, and their lasting friendship, even in prison,

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:41.059
shows that they maintained their love and affection for each other.

00:10:41.059 --> 00:10:45.860
Dear brothers, elders, may we do likewise.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.500
Let's settle disagreements quickly and peacefully.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:56.460
When we do so, we'll reap not only peace, but we'll prove to be examples to the flock

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.460
just like Paul and Barnabas.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.019
Brother Stephen let a member of the governing body will now consider the final talk of this

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:11.259
symposium, how they sowed and reaped peace, modern day examples.
