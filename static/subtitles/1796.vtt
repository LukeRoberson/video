00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:11.029
Brother Van Elberg was a young Dutch man raced during the post-World War I era who enjoyed life like all young men his age.

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:21.030
He loved playing chess and following the latest football results and was the proud father of two children, his daughter Henny and his son Fitz.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:31.030
Together with his wife Liz, he created a cozy home for them which was located in the Azalia Strad in the city of Swaller in the Netherlands.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:44.179
My parents had the habit to study together on Saturday evening and I had to read the first two paragraphs and I also had to answer the questions.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.179
Well, this stayed with me for the rest of my life.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.840
Herman loved sharing the Bible's message of a peaceful future with his fellow citizens of Swaller.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.840
Showing that today will come when nations no longer will go to war against each other.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.459
However, things were about to change.

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:15.459
In 1939, neighbouring Germany started World War II.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:22.459
Because the Nazis were set on exterminating Jehovah's Witnesses, many of them had to flee the country.

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:29.459
Moved by unselfish love, Herman opened his home to offer them shelter.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:32.459
One day my father said to my mother,

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.459
Liz, I received a letter from the society.

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.459
A brother is coming to stay with us.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.459
My mother said, oh Herman, this can't go on like that.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.459
We won't be able to feed all of them to which my father replied.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.459
But Liz, I'm a butcher. There will be enough meat for all.

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:59.840
On May 10, 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.569
Now, Herman and his family were also at risk of falling prey to the Nazi regime.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.569
Among their neighbours was a family that was very active in pro-German politics during the war.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.569
Another man was responsible for the arrest of a significant number of Jews.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.569
And between these two lived off an Albert family.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.569
Eventually, Herman was betrayed to the police and was arrested.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.569
His arrestors were determined to get information concerning the people he was helping.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.569
The police resorted to violence beating him severely.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.569
Due to his love for his fellow Christians and his love for God, Herman Kaptis Lips sealed.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:54.569
Mr. von Elberg never revealed any names during the war that meant signing your own death warrant.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.569
Not knowing what had happened to your husband, Lips von Elberg went to the local police station.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.569
But while she was away, the authorities raided their home.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.569
Suddenly, the door flung open and two men entered the room and started moving things around.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:20.569
They pushed the table to one side, pulled up the carpet and started looking under the floor.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:28.569
They found all the literature we had hidden, as well as closing of brothers, which my father had hidden in the cavity wall.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.569
The authorities confiscated the literature Herman had hidden in his home.

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.569
The literature found that his place wasn't his, but that of his congregation.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.569
But he never mentioned the names of those who had brought it.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.569
That, to me, makes this very special.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.569
Unwilling to waver in their determination to protect their fellow believers,

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.569
Herman and Lips von Elberg were both imprisoned.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.039
Together with my grandfather, I visited my mother.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.039
We had to walk across the huge courtyard.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:11.020
While we were walking, I suddenly hear Hennie.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.019
And there was my father, and he gave me an apple.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.019
That's the last I ever saw of my father.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.019
Eventually, Herman and Lips were sent to concentration camps.

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:28.019
Herman was sent to Dachau.

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:33.019
Lips was transferred to the Ravensburg concentration camp.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:39.019
While she returned home after a while, Herman von Elberg did not.

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:45.019
He died on February 17, 1943, at the age of 30,

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:49.019
leaving behind his bereaved wife and two children.

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:56.019
Of course, the witnesses as a whole were deeply impacted by the war.

00:04:56.019 --> 00:05:02.019
What really strikes me is that they never considered themselves heroes.

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:08.019
Herman was one of at least 132 Jehovah's Witnesses in the Netherlands,

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:15.019
who died at the hands of the Nazi regime for their belief in a better world under the Kingdom of God.

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:20.019
All they had to do to be freed was to renounce their faith,

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:23.019
or as in the case of Herman von Elberg,

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:27.019
simply provide names of fellow believers.

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:30.019
To love your brothers more than you love yourself,

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:34.019
that really meant something to him.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:40.019
Down to this very day, I pray every day that I may be just like them.
