00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.259
This is my sister, Laila.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.299
This is my sister, Mimi.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.699
Um, my sister, Laila, she is very caring, I know that, for sure.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:17.940
One thing that I appreciate about Mimi is that she have the self-sacrificing spirit.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.739
We love our family.

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:27.100
What I love most about my mom is that she has a big heart.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.300
And I know that my dad really truly loves his family.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.700
Our sister, Sophie, always takes care of you, making sure you are okay.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.500
Our family is something that we would never want to replace.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.479
To us, it's a forever family.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.880
But it wasn't always like that.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.880
We haven't always been sisters.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.479
At a young age, I was already in the foster home,

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.079
and then Mimi became my foster sister.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.159
We were not treated as part of their family.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.760
We never knew what love felt like.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.560
There isn't a bedroom for us.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.359
Me and Laila were shared a couch.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:16.760
Our foster family, they would leave us by ourselves at home.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.560
And me and Laila had to take care of ourselves.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.560
And so we were very close together, because we would talk to each other and just help each other out.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.760
When we would go to school, we didn't have school supplies, so I would steal stuff.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.959
And we didn't have school uniforms.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.760
We had clothing that was dirty.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.159
I feel like, in some way, that was all those experience kind of make me feel like I don't care.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.959
I didn't like authority figures and didn't really trust them.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.359
I was lost. I was confused.

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:57.359
I just did whatever I could possibly to protect myself.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:03.269
We have experienced things that no children should go through.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.469
We found out there's a family who wanted to adopt us.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.069
I was 12 years old and I was 9 years old.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.069
One thing that was tough for me was conversing.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.669
I didn't know any English and it was hard for my parents to know how I felt,

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.469
because I had a hard time expressing if I was sad or scared.

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.669
I had a difficult time to trust.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.469
But they showed us love and they hugged us and just made us feel like home.

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:41.870
As I got to know them better and I got to see that they truly love me

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.469
and that they truly treat me like their daughter,

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.870
helped me to develop love and trust.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.270
The first time I saw my mom in debt praying at the dinner meal,

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.669
it was very new to me because I never knew that there was a God.

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.669
I had some past experience with religion and I didn't like it.

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:07.870
So whenever I saw my mom in debt praying, I was uncomfortable with it.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.870
They had to figure out a way to introduce their best friend Jehovah to us.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.870
They took us to this place called the Kingdom Home.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.870
The first thing we felt was warmth and love.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.870
All these friends coming up and to say hi to us,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.270
giving us hugs, just super loving towards us.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.270
Dad would give us a note pad and he told us to draw anything that you understand.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.870
And so that was our notes. We would just draw pictures.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.270
They would pray with us, teaching us how to pray specifically

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.469
and see how Jehovah can answer our prayer.

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.469
We would eat breakfast every day together and do daily texts.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:04:01.740
We would do re-enact Bible stories and prepare for meetings.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.740
The Simplify Wash House came out and it really helped us so much.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.340
I was able to really learn more about Jehovah and understand it.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.740
And that helped me to give more comments and draw closer to Jehovah.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.939
A big change for me was strain the 2014 International Convention.

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:25.740
Just seeing love in the unity between brothers and sisters touched my heart.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.540
That also helped me to progress towards making the decision of getting baptized.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.139
Going on service more, I think it really helped me to draw closer to Jehovah

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.939
and making the Kingdom feel real to me.

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.939
And so that's why I wanted to get baptized.

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:48.339
After I graduated high school, I started to pioneer.

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:52.540
It's one way to show my love to Jehovah.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.540
I used to just take care of myself.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.139
But I learned to take care of others and to think of others first.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.740
For us young ones, we should appreciate every moment that we have with our parents.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.939
Your parents are the best friend that you could ever have.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:12.939
Going on service wasn't easy for me at first because I'm actually a very shy person.

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.540
But I decided to rely on Jehovah and started pioneering.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.740
And just recently, I started commuting to Bethel.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:28.230
One day a week, the important quality that Jehovah have told me is love.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.430
I felt that love from my family, from Jehovah, from my friends.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.230
I learned that it's all good to love people.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.629
And that's what you're supposed to do.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.829
You love people and take care of people.

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:45.230
And I feel like my life is more satisfying and meaningful.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.029
When I meditate and think about what Jehovah has done for me and Lay Lay,

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:51.829
I don't have to be afraid.

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:55.430
Jehovah is my secure refuge because life's may change,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.430
but Jehovah does not change.
