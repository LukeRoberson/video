00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.360
Welcome to our program.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.359
What are the benefits of making the effort to serve in an unassigned territory?

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:15.359
Join this family as they travel to a distant area to support the kingdom preaching work.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:21.359
We will see how such a decision builds their faith in our young ones.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.359
Have you started noticing the opposite sex?

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.359
And yet, you know you're not old enough to get married.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.359
What can help you to take control of such natural feelings?

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.359
We will find out later in the program.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.359
We'll also hear the fascinating story of Eric Frost,

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:47.359
a brother who was sent to a Nazi concentration camp during World War II because of his faith.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.359
How did he and his fellow brothers help each other to remain faithful?

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.359
You will find this story very encouraging.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:02.359
That much more is coming your way on this May program of J. W. Broadcasting.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:33.069
I would first like to read to you some passages from the Bible found at Ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 through 19.

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.069
This will also establish the theme for my comments this month.

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.069
Ephesians 3 starting with verse 14. Paul said,

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:52.069
For this reason I bend my knees to the Father to whom every family in heaven and on earth owes its name.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:02:01.069
I pray that he may grant you through the abundance of his glory to be made mighty in the man you are inside with power through his spirit

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.069
and that through your faith you may have the Christ dwell in your hearts with love.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:19.069
May you be rooted and established in the foundation in order that with all the holy ones you may be thoroughly able to comprehend fully what is the breadth and length and height and depth

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:29.069
and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge so that you may be filled with all the fullness that God gives.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:41.069
Now verse 15 is the inspiration for my theme namely glorified Jehovah, the one to whom every family owes its name.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.069
The family unit is under a vicious attack in these last days.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.069
The insight will lived up to its name under the heading family.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.069
The very insightful comment reads this way.

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:10.069
The inspired scriptures have foretold a vicious attack on the family institution with a consequent breaking down of morality and of human society outside the congregation.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:24.069
The article pointed out that in the last days a condition in which disobedience to parents, disloyalty and absence of natural affection would be rife.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.069
Even among those having a form of godly devotion.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:37.069
How can married couples, parents and children counteract such a diabolical attack?

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:53.069
Do you remember those verses we read in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 16 said that the one to whom every family owes its name Jehovah would grant us to be made mighty in the person we are inside.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:03.069
Yes, Jehovah can give us the internal spiritual strength to fight back against Satan's efforts to destroy the family.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.069
How?

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:15.069
By being immersed in God's word, in particular by imitating the loving way that Jesus treated his disciples.

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:23.069
Did you note that Ephesians 3 17 said we are to have the Christ dwell in our hearts with love?

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.069
Yes.

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:38.069
If each of us cherishes the Christ in our hearts to the point that he dwells or resides there constantly, our family will not only survive but it will truly thrive.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:49.069
This will be so evident that verse 17 further states that we will be rooted and established on the foundation, we will be solid.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:58.069
And keep in mind that 1 Corinthians 3 11 says that the foundation on which we build is Jesus Christ.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:07.069
Then verse 18 of Ephesians chapter 3 indicates that our spiritual peripheral vision will be enhanced.

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:14.069
We will not have spiritual blind spots that could allow the spirit of the world to creep into the family.

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:23.069
That verse says that we will be thoroughly able to comprehend fully what is the breadth and length and height and depth.

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:31.069
All aspects of Jesus' personality will come into play as we interact with family members.

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:43.069
Verse 19 sums up the result when it says that we would then have come to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge, granted.

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:56.069
Knowledge is important but it is the application of Christ's like love that will preserve our family keeping it vibrantly intact.

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:02.069
Family life in these critical last days could be likened to those who suffer from diabetes.

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:08.069
It is believed that diabetes is caused by both genetic and environmental factors.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:17.069
Similarly, all in the family have inherited sin and imperfection from our first human parents Adam and Eve as if genetically.

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:26.069
However, we are also exposed to the ever more toxic environmental factors of Satan's evil world.

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:36.069
Most who suffer from a serious case of diabetes need to use two methods to successfully relieve the symptoms and lead a normal life.

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:43.069
They have to watch their diet and in many cases take an injection of insulin daily.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:56.069
Spiritually, we need to avoid the sickly, sweet junk food that the world promotes in movies, talk shows, the internet, and in print.

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:06.069
Just as with the person who has diabetes, this requires a permanent lifestyle change from what we might have exposed ourselves to in the past.

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:17.069
In addition to avoiding unwholesome junk food from Satan's system, we also need to take daily injections of God's Word and other wholesome provisions.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:24.069
This has become more and more important the deeper we get into these last days.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:30.069
How has our organization provided this when it comes to family life?

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:36.069
Well, in the early 1900s, the focus was on preaching the good news.

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:41.069
Little attention was given to building strong Christian marriages and families.

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:48.069
For a time, marriage was even discouraged, well beyond the intent of the scriptures.

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:59.069
I did some checking and, commendably, between 1919 and 1921, there was a feature in the Golden Age magazine once or twice a month called

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:07.069
the Juvenile Bible Study. In 1920, a brochure was released called the Golden Age ABC.

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:18.069
Then it wasn't until 1941 that the now famous book entitled Children was handed out to all young ones at the convention that year.

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:25.069
But as the last days progressed, more and more information for families was produced.

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:32.070
For example, in the 1970s, the book making your family life happy was released.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:40.070
About the same time, the books listening to the great teacher and your youth getting the best out of it were published.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:48.070
In 1982, a wait began a regular series that has run for decades entitled Young People Ask.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:57.070
We now have two up-to-date books with the same title and the series of articles continues on the JW.org website.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:08.070
We have the book Learn from the Great Teacher and so many features and activities for young ones on the website that I would be out of time if I try to enumerate them all.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:15.070
There are also regular articles in our magazines about marriage and family life.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:25.070
And I will certainly never forget the privilege I had in 2012 to introduce the animated series Become Jehovah's Friend.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:30.070
That is proved to be a blessing for both young ones and their parents.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.070
What a teaching tool for both.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:43.740
In 2014, I attended the International Convention in Atlanta, Georgia, here in the United States.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:53.740
After a little two-year-old girl saw my face on the big jumbo screen giving a talk, she eagerly started searching all around her for someone.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:02.740
When her parents asked her who she was looking for, she said, Caleb, he must be here because I saw his grandfather giving a talk.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:08.740
Many children asked to meet Caleb in person when they visit Bethel.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.740
Two postings of an item every month is making quite an impression on little hearts.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:27.740
With Bible principles being impressed on the minds and hearts of children so early, we prayerfully anticipate many spiritually-minded teenagers in the years to come.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:34.740
We have so much healthy spiritual food for counteracting family diabetes.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:42.740
For this, we give all glory to Jehovah, the one to whom every family owes its name.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:51.740
One of the favorite passages of Scripture that anyone professing to be Christian loves is the 23rd Psalm.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:11:03.740
Family heads. Can we benefit from imitating not only the fine shepherd Jesus but also the great shepherd Jehovah God?

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:14.740
I'm going to borrow the text of the 23rd Psalm and adjust the word so that we can sense a family's tranquility when headship is exercised properly.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:30.169
In fact, you husbands, as the Scriptures read, imagine it is your wife's voice describing the effect your headship has on your family.

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:42.169
My husband is our shepherd. We will lack nothing. In grassy pastures, refreshing recreation, he makes us lie down.

00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:57.169
He leads us to well-watered resting places, meetings and conventions. He refreshes us. He leads us in the ministry and the paths of righteousness for the sake of Jehovah's name.

00:11:57.169 --> 00:12:06.169
Though we walk in the valley of deep economic shadow, we fear no harm for dad is with us.

00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:17.169
You rod in your staff, loving discipline, reassure us. You prepare a table of family worship helping the children for us before our enemies.

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:24.169
You refresh our heads with oil. Our cup of family well-being is well-filled.

00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:37.169
Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue our family all the days of our life and our family will dwell in the house of Jehovah for all our days.

00:12:37.169 --> 00:12:49.419
No further application called for. We feel the sense of security that envelops the interior rooms of such a home, don't we?

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:55.919
Do you remember the point made in Ephesians chapter 3 which we read earlier?

00:12:55.919 --> 00:13:01.919
We are to treasure Jesus' personality and let it dwell in our heart.

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:09.919
If all in the family make a determined effort to treat each other like Jesus would, we can conquer the world.

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:19.919
Yes, we, his spiritual family in heaven and all humans on earth who dedicate their lives to him give glory to Jehovah.

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:31.919
Indeed, we thank Jehovah for all the spiritual provisions he's made through his word and organization to protect every family who takes up his name.

00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:40.919
Made Jehovah bless all of you families as you strive to win the war that Satan wages against you in these last days.

00:13:40.919 --> 00:13:53.029
An important aspect of keeping the family spiritual health intact is by making full use of the family worship arrangement.

00:13:53.029 --> 00:14:03.029
In this dramatization pay attention to how the family head is aware of the needs of the family and how he plans accordingly.

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:09.029
Hi, my name is Joe. A few weeks ago we all sat together for supper.

00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:14.029
I was so tired and my wife Jenny felt the same way.

00:14:14.029 --> 00:14:21.029
She always does it all, taking care of the children so well, but it was not easy for her in recent weeks.

00:14:21.029 --> 00:14:27.029
Sarah felt that we are too restrictive on how she dresses. She just does not understand.

00:14:27.029 --> 00:14:34.029
It was hard to convince her and to motivate her to share in the field service is becoming a challenge.

00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:39.029
It was not always like this. She used to enjoy going out in field service.

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:47.029
And Tom, he is such a good boy, but all of a sudden he was raving about the games his classmates have on their phones.

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:54.029
It's always about having supernatural powers and it fascinated him even though he is small.

00:14:54.029 --> 00:15:01.029
But when I asked him to take out the garbage suddenly his superpowers left him.

00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:10.029
And Mike, our smallest, it was hard to get him to go to bed or clean up his room.

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:16.309
I realized there are a few things we need to speak about.

00:15:16.309 --> 00:15:21.309
Joe came to me and we talked a lot about our children that same evening.

00:15:21.309 --> 00:15:28.309
We wondered what would be the best for them. We prayed together. Then we had an idea.

00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:37.580
The following day we asked our children if we can consider Noah as the theme for our next family worship.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:43.580
All of us liked the idea. Each one of us should prepare something.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:58.639
Mike, Tom and I wanted to build the ark. And of course we need the animals.

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:05.370
And Sarah should collect pictures for this story from our publications.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:13.509
I also had to take time to think again about the story of Noah and how it can help our family.

00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:18.509
Jenny and Sarah were responsible for the wardrobe and food.

00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:24.509
While preparing, I got the chance to speak with Sarah about her dress in a more relaxed setting.

00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:33.690
She understood that like Noah, when it comes to Jehovah's commands, we need to do just so.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:39.690
Then the evening arrived. We talked about how it was before the flood.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:46.690
And what kind of world Noah and his family lived in. Noah's family needed real courage to preach.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:52.690
They had to explain about the rain and how the ark would be needed to survive the flood.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:59.690
Something that had never happened before. All the people thought they were crazy.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:08.690
And while we were talking about this, it came out that Sarah felt embarrassed when she met a schoolmate in the field service recently.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:15.690
I realized Noah must have felt the same as me. And yet he was so courageous.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:21.690
Dad read Genesis 6 verse 9. Noah walked with the true God.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:27.690
So he could have every confidence in his friend Jehovah. I want to be just like that.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.690
For Tom, I found a great picture.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:37.690
Dad told us that the world at this time was very bad. People were fighting and many were afraid.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.690
And that is why Jehovah brought the flood.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:45.690
It made me think about the games from my schoolmates. I like to play those games.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:50.690
But I know that Jehovah does not like that. So why do I?

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:54.690
And the best part was when we got inside the ark.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:04.130
Then our red Genesis 6 19. And bring into the ark two of every sort of living creature.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.130
Dad showed us how the animals went into the ark.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:14.130
Each one had its own place and they went inside two at a time without any chaos.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:20.630
I explained that we also need to keep our rooms clean, like the ark.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:28.140
I saw that Mike got the point. We wanted to keep in mind Genesis 6 22.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:34.140
And Noah did according to all that God had commanded him. He did just so.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:41.220
And then the rain came. But we survived. That was great.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:48.220
We all realized Noah also must have been tired sometimes. But he never gave up.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.220
This was a good lesson for us.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:19:00.220
We must take care of our family as Noah did also by having a regular family worship like this.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:09.099
That example really showed many of the great benefits of family worship.

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:15.099
In addition to the obvious coming together to learn more about our Heavenly Father,

00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:22.099
we saw how family worship gave the daughter an opportunity to open up about matters that had been bothering her.

00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:30.099
And thanks to the good work of the parents, all of the children learned something they could apply in their daily lives.

00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:37.099
We've now invited brother and sister Ortiz from New Britain, Connecticut to visit our studio.

00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:41.099
Brother Ortiz serves as an elder and as a regular pioneer.

00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:44.099
He's had many additional privileges of service over the years.

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:49.099
And Lynette has been regular pioneering for over six years.

00:19:49.099 --> 00:19:54.099
However, the reason we wanted to talk with them is that thus far,

00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:58.099
they have successfully countered Satan's attacks on their family.

00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:01.099
We'd like to hear how they accomplished this.

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:05.099
First of all, Freddie, tell us a little bit about your family.

00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:09.099
Neither Lynette nor I were raising the truth.

00:20:09.099 --> 00:20:12.099
However, we met and we felt in love.

00:20:12.099 --> 00:20:15.099
At that time, marriage was not for me.

00:20:15.099 --> 00:20:21.099
So we started a romantic relationship for two years before we started attending to the first meeting at the Kingdom Hall.

00:20:21.099 --> 00:20:25.099
So now after we started studying the Bible, we took two studies per week,

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:27.099
and we knew that this was the truth.

00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:31.099
But also, we learned that Jehovah held Jehovah's Seas in Marari,

00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:34.099
so we needed to do some changes.

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:38.099
Lynette's parents want her to continue with her education.

00:20:38.099 --> 00:20:41.099
So we needed to change our behavior.

00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:46.099
So two years after, we did the changes,

00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:48.099
number one, because we didn't love Jehovah.

00:20:48.099 --> 00:20:51.099
And we too, because we loved what we were learning.

00:20:51.099 --> 00:20:55.099
It was worth it to follow Bible principles.

00:20:55.099 --> 00:20:59.099
So two years later, we got married, and we got baptized,

00:20:59.099 --> 00:21:01.099
and then we got married.

00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:02.099
Very good.

00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:05.099
Lynette, you were raised without an knowledge of Jehovah God.

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:13.099
What changes did you both have to make to ensure your own family would have a fine foundation and be successful?

00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:18.099
Well, prior to our baptism, Freddie had a serious drinking problem.

00:21:18.099 --> 00:21:23.099
Based on the way we were raised, there was a lot of jealousy going on.

00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:27.099
And I would say, like of confidence and trust in each other.

00:21:27.099 --> 00:21:31.099
My Bible teacher, thankfully, suggested us to study the book,

00:21:31.099 --> 00:21:37.099
making your family life happy, and we ended up studying that book twice.

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:43.099
The publication and the Bible principles in it became the foundation of our wonderful marriage,

00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:46.099
and the happy family we enjoyed today.

00:21:46.099 --> 00:21:53.099
Very nice. So Freddie, maybe you can tell us about your children and what they're doing with their lives now.

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:56.099
We have two sons, Gabriel. He's the oldest one.

00:21:56.099 --> 00:21:59.099
He started regular party near where he was 14 years old.

00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:03.099
At 18, he was appointed as ministerial servant.

00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:10.099
At 22 years old, he's been working at the plumbing department at the Warwick construction for more than two years.

00:22:10.099 --> 00:22:16.099
Adrian is now 18 years old, and he also started regular party near when he was 14.

00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:20.099
Currently, he handles the account for the congregation and other privates as well.

00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:26.099
Well, they both have had an early start in theirocratic careers.

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:30.099
It's commendable. I'm sure you're both proud of them.

00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:35.099
And we're confident that Jehovah, the one to whom every family owes its name,

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:39.099
is pleased that they're giving an answer to his taunter.

00:22:39.099 --> 00:22:47.099
In addition to the family lifebook, what else contributed to the success your family has experienced, Lynette?

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:53.099
The governing body has provided with so many publications with directions for families,

00:22:53.099 --> 00:22:56.099
of course, always in Jehovah's word.

00:22:56.099 --> 00:23:01.099
So we decided early on that whenever a question or an issue came up,

00:23:01.099 --> 00:23:04.099
we will not make any decision based on impulse.

00:23:04.099 --> 00:23:07.099
Instead, we will research it in the publications.

00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:14.099
We pray to Jehovah for him to give us wisdom and we even pray for him to guide us

00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:19.099
to find the right time to talk to each other or to counsel the boys.

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:25.099
I have always heard that there were stages on the shelf life and personality development.

00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:29.099
So I researched it in advance as to what to expect.

00:23:29.099 --> 00:23:36.099
In that way, we were not surprised when we saw changes in attitudes or ideas.

00:23:36.099 --> 00:23:42.099
And that helped us realize what needed to be addressed or corrected

00:23:42.099 --> 00:23:46.099
as opposed to what was normal for that stage in the boys' life.

00:23:46.099 --> 00:23:50.099
Very practical. Freddie, what can you add?

00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:56.099
Over the years, I have learned how essential it is to become a good listener and also understanding.

00:23:56.099 --> 00:24:02.099
I tell my family how much I love them every day because we never know in circumstances by change.

00:24:02.099 --> 00:24:06.099
Family worship is very important for us. I know it's easy to put off,

00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:09.099
but the benefits are hard to meet.

00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:17.099
Well, before this arrangement started, as a family, we value the Bible study with a family.

00:24:17.099 --> 00:24:21.099
I learned that a fetus is six months.

00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:24.099
He can recognize family's voice.

00:24:24.099 --> 00:24:30.099
So I started a Bible study with my son when they were still under womb.

00:24:30.099 --> 00:24:34.099
And continue to do so after that.

00:24:34.099 --> 00:24:38.099
I know that secular work and other activities can block

00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:43.099
to a regular program, but we need to fight that tendency.

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:45.099
And we want to succeed in family worship.

00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:52.099
Very good. Well, it seems your efforts paid off when we consider how well your family's done spiritually.

00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:56.099
In the close relationship you have with each other.

00:24:56.099 --> 00:25:01.099
Now, in that, it sounds as if the family is perfect.

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:05.099
No challenges. Is that the case?

00:25:05.099 --> 00:25:12.099
No, not at all. First Corinthians 10, 13 says that Christians will face challenges that are common to them.

00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:19.099
And we have faced the normal challenges that comes with racing a family.

00:25:19.099 --> 00:25:25.099
The same verse indicates that if we do things Jehovah's way,

00:25:25.099 --> 00:25:30.099
we may increase the opportunity for him to make the way out for us.

00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:36.099
One unexpected challenge that has changed our family dynamics over the years now

00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:41.099
was when Freddie was diagnosed with cancer in 2012.

00:25:41.099 --> 00:25:46.099
The treatment was aggressive and took its toll on his health.

00:25:46.099 --> 00:25:53.099
Our whole lifestyle changed. We had to move out from our house to an apartment.

00:25:53.099 --> 00:26:03.099
We gave away our dog's bike and we had to wash our expenses really closely to keep going.

00:26:03.099 --> 00:26:10.099
This could have put a lot of strain in our family and our marriage and in spirituality.

00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:16.099
But again, by praying to Jehovah constantly and applying by both principles,

00:26:16.099 --> 00:26:21.099
I can say my marriage and my family has never been better.

00:26:21.099 --> 00:26:29.099
Spiritually, we kept our routine and we all stay in full-time service throughout the ordeal.

00:26:29.099 --> 00:26:35.099
The boys have cooperated very well. They have offered to work to give us money.

00:26:35.099 --> 00:26:45.099
But we prefer for them to keep focused in the kingdom because we are confident that Jehovah will add on to the things we need.

00:26:45.099 --> 00:26:53.099
Freddie has been a great example for all of us because he pushes himself to keep his spirit to our routine.

00:26:53.099 --> 00:26:57.099
You never see him complaining or in a bad mood.

00:26:57.099 --> 00:27:01.099
And that has been very inspiring for the rest of the family.

00:27:01.099 --> 00:27:03.099
It's quite a story.

00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:10.099
You folks will certainly relate to the convention drama video that was advertised on our April program.

00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:14.099
Freddie, we're very sorry to hear about your physical condition.

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:22.099
Are there any favorite scriptures that you've used to help keep you going spiritually and stay strong?

00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:26.099
There are many of them. Just to mention a few.

00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:32.099
Philippians chapter 4, 6 and 7 have been my life since 2012.

00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:40.099
I have to pray to Jehovah constantly so he can give me the strength that I need to overcome my health.

00:27:40.099 --> 00:27:46.099
And also Philippians says that he will give us peace of mind.

00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:50.099
In addition, he will safeguard our heart.

00:27:50.099 --> 00:27:54.099
And that's something I've been seeing from Jehovah.

00:27:54.099 --> 00:28:02.099
Also, Isaiah 41, 10, say that does not be anxious for I am your God.

00:28:02.099 --> 00:28:10.099
Those words give me confidence that he will keep on helping us in these circumstances of different circumstances of our life.

00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:14.099
I do understand them. I have a lot of responsibilities in the household.

00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:18.099
So I have to revert for verse 31 verse 10 to 31.

00:28:18.099 --> 00:28:22.099
And the way they describe all the responsibilities,

00:28:22.099 --> 00:28:26.099
a good wife, might have to shoulder for the family.

00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:30.099
So brother Mary, she's been prober to 31 wife.

00:28:30.099 --> 00:28:32.099
A good wife for sure.

00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:36.099
You've obviously shown how much you love and respect each other.

00:28:36.099 --> 00:28:38.099
That's commendable.

00:28:38.099 --> 00:28:44.099
And you're focused on being the best parents you could be as a good example for parents viewing the program at this time.

00:28:44.099 --> 00:28:48.099
This will come as a surprise to you.

00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:54.099
But we'd like to invite your two sons out to see what they remember from growing up in the family.

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:58.099
We have Gabriel and Adrian with us.

00:28:58.099 --> 00:29:06.140
Mom's getting a little teary eyes.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:10.140
And I just say, it was a surprise to see.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:16.140
So Gabriel, since you're the oldest, we'll start with you.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:24.140
What do you remember about your family, like first in Puerto Rico and later here in the United States?

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:30.140
I remember faithfully going to all the meetings and going out on service every Saturday.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.140
That was just a routine.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.140
In Puerto Rico, my dad had to work a lot though.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:40.140
And like he said before, that's easy to get in the way of a good family worship routine.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:48.140
But I can honestly say, once we made that transition or moving over here, that helped us to have a good family worship routine.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:52.140
And it has helped us to get closer and closer each day.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:56.140
And now Adrian, anything you can add about the home line?

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.140
Yeah, my mom and dad have always shown a great love for Jehovah.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.140
But also for each other.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.140
So as kids, you could just sense that.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.140
So love and respect is what we've always known.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:13.140
Even now that my brother and I are older, we have a great bond with each other.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.140
We love each other and we could tell each other everything about our lives.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.140
And as due to that love and respect that they have shown.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.140
And even if there are disagreements, which there's always going to be disagreements because it's an imperfect family.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.140
But that love is always there to bridge those differences.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:36.140
I'd also like to add something that helped me a lot was a routine that my dad and I had.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.140
Right before I'm going to school, we would always read the daily texts.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.140
And he would always say, behave.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.140
And remember that Jehovah loves you.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:51.140
And I don't think he knows how much that really helped me go through everyday challenges at school.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.140
That's priceless.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.140
Now, very nice observations.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:04.140
I'm interested in understanding what prompted you to regularly pioneer when you're only 14 years old.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.140
It was at a point where my dad lost his job.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.140
Rather than stressing about it, worrying about it.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.140
He looked at things with a spiritual perspective.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.140
So he started to pioneer.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:20.140
And since our schedules match perfectly, I was his little pioneer, buddy.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.140
I would go out on service with him whenever he needed it.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:30.140
And I feel like if the spiritual families focus on spiritual matters, it helps them to come closer.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:36.140
And I can't imagine how our relationship and respect for one another can be any better than what it is now.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.140
Very nice.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.140
Adrian, you began pioneering when you were 14 as well.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.140
How do you think that affected you as a person?

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:51.140
Well, first of all, the reason why I started pioneering was because I was going out in service with the rest of my family.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:55.140
And since they were already pioneering, I was getting the time in.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:03.140
But I do think that taking on the responsibility of getting at least 70 hours a month in the service.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:07.140
Does make you think differently than 14 than it would have otherwise.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.140
I think it has helped me mature spiritually.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.140
And it has contributed to me being used in my full potential in the congregation.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.140
And honestly, I wouldn't trade it for anything.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.140
Well, maybe going to Bethel.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:28.140
Gabriel, back to you, tell us what was it like when you learned that your dad had a serious health problem

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.140
and would not be able to provide for the family like he used to?

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.140
It was probably one of the biggest challenges I have ever faced.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:43.140
When my dad got diagnosed with cancer, it was about the same time that I got my call to Bethel.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.140
And I was torn, I was divided.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:52.140
I felt like if I was to go to Bethel now, it would be selfish of me to leave my family at a time like that.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.140
But my family always had a spiritual view on things.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:02.140
Insighting scriptures like Matthew 633 constantly helped me to see if as a whole as a family.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:09.140
We put Kingdom interest first that Jehovah was going to provide because he's a loving father and friend.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.140
Then my dad lost his job.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.140
And again, all these feelings came up.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:21.140
But my family was adamant that let me know that the congregation had been taking care of them for months now.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.140
And then doing some simplifying on their own helped them as well.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.140
And I didn't have to worry about anything.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.140
I do know that there's a scripture that says that we got to take care of our own.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:35.140
So I do anything I can to help my family back home.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:44.140
The only thing I hope is that I can have a good faith like they've shown through these difficult times.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.140
Well, thank all of you for joining us.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:54.140
I think all of us are feeling that emotion and feel very close to you for sharing that.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:59.140
As a father, I can appreciate all that Freddie is trying to do is head of the family.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:05.140
And on that, your support beyond normal is very much to be commended.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:12.139
And we can tell your family is thriving spiritually and we pray Jehovah will continue to bless your efforts.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.139
Come what may.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:20.139
And we thank you Gabriel and Adrian for your surprise to the studio.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:24.139
Thank you very much for taking the time to be interviewed.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.139
Thank you for the privilege.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:28.139
Thank you.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:33.139
Because we just learned an excellent way of maintaining the spirituality of the family

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:37.139
is by spending quality time together in the ministry.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:42.139
We would now like to introduce you to a family from Russia.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:48.139
They traveled far away to work together in unassigned territory in Siberia.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:55.139
Their experience confirms how spiritual activities not only build our faith

00:34:55.139 --> 00:35:01.780
but can also bring our family closer to each other.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:09.519
We are traveling to a very interesting territory.

00:35:09.519 --> 00:35:12.519
It is on the shores of Lake Baikal.

00:35:12.519 --> 00:35:16.519
From where we live, it is 600 kilometers.

00:35:16.519 --> 00:35:19.519
We have so many memories to take home.

00:35:19.519 --> 00:35:23.519
The scenery is always stunning and all types of weather.

00:35:23.519 --> 00:35:29.219
Here there are beautiful cliffs and valleys.

00:35:29.219 --> 00:35:32.219
We cross several mountain passes.

00:35:32.219 --> 00:35:34.219
Then we go by ferry.

00:35:34.219 --> 00:35:40.219
It felt very strange being in the car while crossing the river.

00:35:40.219 --> 00:35:44.219
When we have the opportunity, we witness to people we meet on the way.

00:35:44.219 --> 00:35:48.219
Why do sincere people trust the Holy Scriptures?

00:35:48.219 --> 00:35:51.219
Please have a look at what it says here.

00:35:51.219 --> 00:35:56.500
All Scripture is inspired of God.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.500
We usually serve an isolated territory for a week or more.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.500
We have come to the same place where we were last year.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.500
So we already know a lot about it.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.500
Living in a tent is very different from living in the city.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:16.500
Here we don't have any conveniences like a toilet or shower.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.500
The only place to wash is in Lake Baikal, which is freezing.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.500
This simple life is like an adventure.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.500
As we have quite a big group, there are 12 of us.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.500
We have also organized our spiritual routine.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:41.500
We consider the daily texts together and take part in discussing our publications using the questions.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.500
We have a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.500
Everybody enjoys it.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.500
Our isolated territory where we are preaching is a rural area.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.500
Here we don't have any prepared maps.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:03.500
So when we have our meetings for field service, we divide up all taking different streets.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.500
We also think about what clothes to wear.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.500
Our experience has shown that our clothes can help us to win over these people.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.500
So we try to dress simply.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.030
We don't wear ties.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.030
The people there are kind.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.030
Sometimes they even invite us in.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:27.030
We can have discussions with some of them.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.030
Sometimes long ones.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:34.030
There you meet more receptive people than unresponsive ones.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:37.030
And that really is encouraging.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:42.030
It makes you just want to keep on preaching without stopping.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.030
The trips have helped our son make spiritual progress.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:50.030
For us as his parents, that is the greatest blessing.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:56.030
For example, after one of these trips, he became an unbaptized publisher.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:59.030
This territory is different from what I am used to.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.030
So I was worried.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:07.030
I didn't know what sort of people lived there or what their attitude was towards witnesses.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:12.030
But after praying when knocking the first door, my fear disappeared.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.030
I was able to place 270 trips.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:21.030
While we were witnessing, we showed the people the addresses in our publications

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:26.030
so that they could write if they found what they had read interesting.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:31.030
We usually start witnessing about 12 noon and we finish around 5 pm.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:40.250
Then the relaxation part of our day begins.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:45.250
We have a campfire, some games, some music and fun.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.250
Early in the day, we used our energy in the ministry.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:53.250
And afterwards, we were able to relax and enjoy each other's company.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:57.250
So we combine both our ministry and relaxation.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:05.780
One of the delights of these trips is the fish, the famous bicole omel.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.780
These trips really strengthen the unity and our family.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.780
We really have drawn closer together.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.780
It is invigorating and enriches us spiritually.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:22.780
We experience pure joy from knowing that Jehovah has blessed our efforts.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:27.780
We feel like we have our batteries charged for the entire year.

00:39:35.469 --> 00:39:40.469
It is very encouraging to see such a spiritually focused family.

00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:47.469
And did you notice that it was after one such trip that their son became an unbaptized publisher?

00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:51.469
I'm sure that brought much joy to his parents.

00:39:51.469 --> 00:39:56.469
Are you interested in a preaching assignment and territory seldom worked?

00:39:56.469 --> 00:40:00.469
If so, form a group of no more than 20 publishers

00:40:00.469 --> 00:40:04.469
and ask the elders in your congregation for further instructions

00:40:04.469 --> 00:40:08.469
and an application for territory seldom worked.

00:40:08.469 --> 00:40:13.469
Once you have filled out the form, the congregation service committee will review it

00:40:13.469 --> 00:40:17.469
and submit it to your local branch.

00:40:17.469 --> 00:40:22.469
Theocratic activities such as family worship, spending time in the ministry together,

00:40:22.469 --> 00:40:29.469
along with balanced amounts of recreation, can truly fortify our family.

00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:32.469
As we saw in the interview with the Ortiz family,

00:40:32.469 --> 00:40:37.469
such spiritual preparation helps us when we face challenges.

00:40:37.469 --> 00:40:42.469
In this dramatization, a family followed scriptural counsel

00:40:42.469 --> 00:40:47.469
when they faced the challenge of having to relocate to another city.

00:40:47.469 --> 00:40:55.760
For 23 years, we've called this place home.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.760
We've raised a family here.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.760
Two beautiful girls.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.329
Six months ago, my boss called me into his office.

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:08.329
The company was restructuring.

00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:13.329
They valued my work, but if I wanted to keep my job, I would need to move.

00:41:13.329 --> 00:41:15.329
It was a difficult decision.

00:41:15.329 --> 00:41:18.329
My job allowed me to support my family well

00:41:18.329 --> 00:41:22.329
and it had never interfered with our spiritual routine.

00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:24.329
We said many prayers about it.

00:41:24.329 --> 00:41:29.329
We discussed it as a family, and we decided to move.

00:41:30.329 --> 00:41:32.329
But we were anxious.

00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:37.329
My family has only ever known one home, one congregation.

00:41:37.329 --> 00:41:40.329
My girls have many friends in the congregation.

00:41:40.329 --> 00:41:43.329
Good example, so we're helping them to serve Jehovah.

00:41:43.329 --> 00:41:46.329
This is going to be hard on all of us.

00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:51.329
A brother in our hall had moved into the congregation a few years ago.

00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:55.329
I asked him how his family coped with the challenge.

00:41:55.329 --> 00:41:58.329
He said that the key to staying grounded

00:41:58.329 --> 00:42:02.329
is maintaining the one thing that should never change.

00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:07.329
Our spiritual routine, but that requires work and planning.

00:42:07.329 --> 00:42:11.329
To make sure our move doesn't stop us from getting to the meetings,

00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:15.329
sharing in the ministry, spending time with our brothers and sisters

00:42:15.329 --> 00:42:17.329
and looking after our family.

00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:20.329
His advice was spot on.

00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:24.329
After some research, I found a scripture that illustrated our situation.

00:42:25.329 --> 00:42:30.329
And the rain poured down, and the floods came, and the winds blew,

00:42:30.329 --> 00:42:32.329
and lashed against that house.

00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:37.329
But it did not cave in, for it had been founded on the rock.

00:42:37.329 --> 00:42:41.329
The discrete man built his house on good foundations.

00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:44.329
It took a plan, and he worked hard.

00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:48.329
When the storm came, his house survived.

00:42:48.329 --> 00:42:52.329
As a family, we needed a plan that would help us

00:42:52.329 --> 00:42:55.329
spiritually grounded through our move.

00:42:55.329 --> 00:42:57.329
So we wrote our own plan.

00:42:57.329 --> 00:43:00.329
Just like the discrete man,

00:43:00.329 --> 00:43:05.329
we wanted to build our move on a strong spiritual foundation.

00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:09.329
So we made a visit to our new congregation ahead of our move.

00:43:09.329 --> 00:43:13.329
Over the years, it becomes a comfort to walk into a kingdom hall

00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:16.329
and see familiar faces.

00:43:16.329 --> 00:43:20.329
Walking into our new congregation reminded me

00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:23.329
how much we're going to miss everyone.

00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:28.329
But the Bible tells us that with the measure we measure out,

00:43:28.329 --> 00:43:31.329
others will measure to us in return.

00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:35.329
So we resolve to show love first.

00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:38.900
Hello, Angerthika.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.900
Hi, I'm Samantha, nice to meet you.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.900
The best way to get to know our new congregation

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.900
is to work with the brothers and sisters in the ministry.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.900
No matter where we go,

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.900
we'll find people that love Jehovah and each other.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.900
Moving day finally arrived.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.900
The last boxes were packed.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.900
We got the door one final time

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:14.750
and began our journey to our new home.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:19.750
It took effort, but visiting the congregation ahead of time

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.750
was well worth it.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:25.750
Look, we already have friends here.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.750
Unpacking seemed to never end.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.750
But the one thing that we all promised ourselves

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:36.750
at family worship was that we would not let our move

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.960
affect our spiritual routine.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:48.059
Does anyone see my ties? Found them!

00:44:48.059 --> 00:44:52.059
We planned that we wouldn't let anything stop us

00:44:52.059 --> 00:44:54.059
from going to the meetings.

00:44:54.059 --> 00:44:57.059
The ministry is very different.

00:44:57.059 --> 00:45:02.059
We've had to adapt and learn new techniques.

00:45:02.059 --> 00:45:05.059
The brothers and sisters are different too.

00:45:05.059 --> 00:45:11.059
It's important not to focus on negative comparisons.

00:45:11.059 --> 00:45:15.059
Instead, be positive.

00:45:15.059 --> 00:45:18.059
During this transition, it is especially important

00:45:18.059 --> 00:45:22.059
to be sensitive to our spiritual needs.

00:45:22.059 --> 00:45:25.059
Family worship is vital.

00:45:26.059 --> 00:45:30.059
Keeping spiritually grounded through such a big transition

00:45:30.059 --> 00:45:33.059
isn't easy, especially with a family.

00:45:33.059 --> 00:45:37.059
It took a lot of time and energy to care for our needs.

00:45:37.059 --> 00:45:41.059
Not just spiritually, but emotionally too.

00:45:41.059 --> 00:45:44.059
Planning ahead like the discrete man

00:45:44.059 --> 00:45:51.659
helped our family to stay spiritually grounded.

00:45:51.659 --> 00:45:53.659
Having a spiritually strong family

00:45:53.659 --> 00:45:57.659
prepares us also for other changes in life.

00:45:57.659 --> 00:45:59.659
Perhaps you are in your teens

00:45:59.659 --> 00:46:03.659
and you're starting to notice those of the opposite sex.

00:46:03.659 --> 00:46:07.659
Such emotions are natural and are part of growing up.

00:46:07.659 --> 00:46:10.659
But if you're not old enough to get married,

00:46:10.659 --> 00:46:12.659
what do you need to keep in mind?

00:46:12.659 --> 00:46:15.659
This young sister made wise decisions

00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:18.659
with the loving help of her parents.

00:46:18.659 --> 00:46:33.260
Hey, yours.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.260
Yeah, thanks.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.260
You're really right.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.260
Yeah, and you're Sean.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.260
Yeah, I've seen you around.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.260
You play a good basketball.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.260
Thanks, so do you.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.260
So you want to hang out sometime?

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.260
Sure.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:55.110
My name is Lily, and I sort of have this problem.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:47:01.550
There's a boy named Sean that recently moved to our school.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:06.550
I know I'm not supposed to like anyone who's not a witness.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:08.550
The trouble was he is a witness.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:12.550
Sean and his family moved into our congregation.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:17.550
And the more I saw of him, the more I liked him.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:49.980
Like I said, I had a problem.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:58.170
Every day I see couples my age at school.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:02.510
To me, they look happy.

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:09.329
Honestly, I wanted that happiness too.

00:48:09.329 --> 00:48:14.780
My parents noticed my problem too.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.780
And talked about it that night.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:25.929
I'm pretty soon.

00:48:25.929 --> 00:48:27.929
I didn't feel alone anymore.

00:48:27.929 --> 00:48:32.929
The next day, my mom invited me to go with her to run an errand.

00:48:32.929 --> 00:48:35.929
Afterward, we went to a little cafe.

00:48:35.929 --> 00:48:38.929
She asked me how things were going.

00:48:38.929 --> 00:48:41.929
At first, I didn't want to tell her.

00:48:41.929 --> 00:48:44.929
But she made me feel really comfortable.

00:48:44.929 --> 00:48:47.929
So I told her my feelings for Sean.

00:48:47.929 --> 00:48:50.929
Expecting her to think bad of me.

00:48:50.929 --> 00:48:52.929
But she didn't.

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:55.929
Everything you're feeling is naturally.

00:48:55.929 --> 00:48:59.929
I remember having the same feelings when I was your age too.

00:48:59.929 --> 00:49:00.929
Really?

00:49:00.929 --> 00:49:01.929
It's true.

00:49:01.929 --> 00:49:04.929
That's just how Jehovah created us, honey.

00:49:04.929 --> 00:49:10.929
And because he created us, he knows the best way for us to be happy.

00:49:10.929 --> 00:49:13.929
And that's all he wants for us.

00:49:13.929 --> 00:49:17.929
And that's all daddy, and I want for you too.

00:49:17.929 --> 00:49:19.929
She didn't scold me.

00:49:19.929 --> 00:49:21.929
She didn't make me feel embarrassed.

00:49:21.929 --> 00:49:27.929
And most importantly, she didn't seem to be in a rush.

00:49:27.929 --> 00:49:30.929
My mom wasn't the only one helping me.

00:49:30.929 --> 00:49:34.929
My dad was preparing to help me with my problem too.

00:49:34.929 --> 00:49:37.929
That evening, we had family worship.

00:49:37.929 --> 00:49:41.929
And once again, they just let me talk.

00:49:41.929 --> 00:49:44.929
They told me I didn't have to hold back.

00:49:44.929 --> 00:49:45.929
So I didn't.

00:49:45.929 --> 00:49:47.929
I just don't know what to do.

00:49:47.929 --> 00:49:50.929
Lily, thank you for telling us how you feel.

00:49:50.929 --> 00:49:52.929
Let me ask you something.

00:49:52.929 --> 00:49:58.929
Why do you think Jehovah created us with these natural feelings toward the opposite sex?

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:02.929
So that one day a man or woman can marry.

00:50:02.929 --> 00:50:03.929
That's right.

00:50:03.929 --> 00:50:08.929
In fact, a good marriage is like two skaters on the ice.

00:50:08.929 --> 00:50:13.929
A beautiful performance can seem effortless, but is it really?

00:50:13.929 --> 00:50:14.929
No.

00:50:14.929 --> 00:50:19.929
No one would even attempt that without practice a capable partner,

00:50:19.929 --> 00:50:21.929
or the right kind of guidance, right?

00:50:21.929 --> 00:50:22.929
Yeah.

00:50:22.929 --> 00:50:26.929
Well, it's the same with a good marriage, sweetie.

00:50:26.929 --> 00:50:28.929
It doesn't just happen.

00:50:28.929 --> 00:50:34.929
It too depends on a good partner, coordinated effort,

00:50:34.929 --> 00:50:39.929
but most importantly, wise counsel from Jehovah.

00:50:39.929 --> 00:50:46.929
In fact, could you please turn with me to Psalm chapter 32 and verse 8,

00:50:46.929 --> 00:50:48.929
and read that for us?

00:50:48.929 --> 00:50:49.929
Sure.

00:50:49.929 --> 00:50:55.929
It says, I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:50:55.929 --> 00:50:58.929
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

00:50:58.929 --> 00:51:01.929
Lily, Jehovah loves us very much.

00:51:01.929 --> 00:51:06.929
And if we listen to him, we'll make good decisions in our life

00:51:06.929 --> 00:51:10.929
with absolutely no regrets.

00:51:10.929 --> 00:51:14.929
We talk some more, and then I got some homework.

00:51:14.929 --> 00:51:18.929
My dad gave me some articles he printed out for me to read.

00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:19.929
So I did.

00:51:19.929 --> 00:51:28.619
As I read the words and started meditating on them, I realized something.

00:51:28.619 --> 00:51:32.619
By holding off dating a little longer, I wasn't missing out.

00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:39.789
Rather, I was preparing myself.

00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:44.789
I could use the time now to focus on something much more important.

00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:48.789
My relationship with Jehovah.

00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:53.789
I could also gain Christian qualities and experience that will help me later

00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:55.789
if I ever do get married.

00:51:55.789 --> 00:52:06.900
A strong spiritual upbringing can truly be a protection for us

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:12.900
when young, but also strengthens us as adults.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.900
Further, Eric Frost was a young man in Germany

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:20.900
who set a good example in making wise decisions early in life.

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:25.900
He was born in 1900, baptized 23 years later,

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:29.900
and entered the full-time ministry in 1928.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.900
Not long after, he was put in charge of the underground work

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.900
of the persecuted witnesses of Jehovah in Germany,

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.900
carrying well for that assignment for eight months

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.900
until he was incarcerated.

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.900
In this archived audio recording,

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.900
you will hear the fascinating experience of how Brother Frost

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.900
composed a kingdom melody in the middle of Saxonhausen

00:52:53.900 --> 00:53:01.099
and Nazi concentration camp.

00:53:01.099 --> 00:53:05.099
I always had the desire to compose music.

00:53:07.949 --> 00:53:10.949
As everybody knows, we had the hardest work

00:53:10.949 --> 00:53:13.949
and suffered the hardest in the concentration camps.

00:53:13.949 --> 00:53:15.949
We were starved.

00:53:15.949 --> 00:53:17.949
The labor exceeded our strength,

00:53:17.949 --> 00:53:21.949
and the harassment was often unbearable.

00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:34.789
So as usual, I wanted to find a way to build up the brothers.

00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:38.789
We had such a fine unity there in the Saxonhausen camp.

00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:44.789
I felt moved to compose a song that we could sing together

00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:46.789
for our mutual encouragement.

00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:55.789
Every morning, we marched to the construction site

00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:58.789
of a sewage plant in Aranjanburg.

00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:03.789
Our labor group consisted of about 40 brothers

00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:06.789
under the strict watch of the SS.

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:18.710
While marching, my mind went back and forth and

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:27.710
and gradually a melody formed.

00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:30.710
That's how the music was developed.

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:33.710
But how could the verses enter the camp

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:36.710
without being able to write them down?

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:39.710
I found a few brothers who helped me.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:43.710
I repeated the first verse to one of them until he knew it by heart,

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:47.710
either while marching or while driving the wheelbarrow at work.

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:50.710
I told the second verse to another brother,

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:54.710
still to others, the third and the fourth.

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:57.710
In the evening, I asked each of the brothers

00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:59.710
to recite his verse.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:02.710
That's how the song came to life.

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.710
In the mornings, when the forty of us

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:07.710
were marching through the streets of Aranjanburg,

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.710
we already felt worn out.

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:13.710
When one started humming that melody,

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.710
the entire labor group trembled with excitement.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:20.710
We had to control ourselves to not break out loud singing.

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:23.710
That would have been dangerous, of course.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:25.710
They would have brought us back to the camp

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:27.710
and severely punished us.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:14.710
And God, only our church does come to battle.

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:20.710
Only He can see us and offer us,

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:29.710
only He can see us and offer us.

00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:33.710
As we sat together in the evenings

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:40.710
When someone started humming that melody, quite a number of us sang along, and we rejoiced,

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:42.710
our eyes were shining.

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:51.309
This gave us new courage and hope.

00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:56.429
We also had evenings of worship, talks were given, and we had copies of the watchtower that

00:56:56.429 --> 00:56:58.150
we studied together.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:04.150
So we were able to have some real times of peace, and special encouragement, and felt

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:08.150
uplifted by that song.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:58:10.429
Brother Frost, who was one of the anointed, finished his earthly course in 1987.

00:58:10.429 --> 00:58:16.190
Brother World War II and nine years of imprisonment, he served as the overseer of our branch

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:18.909
office in Germany for ten years.

00:58:18.909 --> 00:58:23.510
This was before the arrangement was instituted of having a branch committee oversee the

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:25.860
work.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:30.659
The very descriptive paintings that you saw in this segment were painted by a brother who

00:58:30.659 --> 00:58:37.059
was imprisoned in a concentration camp similar to the one Brother Frost was in.

00:58:37.059 --> 00:58:39.860
I'm sure you recognized the song.

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:44.380
You can find it in our songbook, though the tune is a little different.

00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:49.099
When Brother Frost found out that his song had been included in it, he was overjoyed

00:58:49.099 --> 00:58:56.579
and said, my clumsy lyrics were transformed into three wonderful verses.

00:58:56.579 --> 00:59:01.860
If you turn to song 17 in your songbook, you'll find the song originally composed by

00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:07.260
Brother Frost forward, you witnesses.

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:13.420
Like Brother Frost, we want to do our best to expand our ministry for Jehovah.

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.059
One way of doing that is by learning a language.

00:59:17.059 --> 00:59:22.739
In this music video, pay close attention to the blessings that resulted from this couple's

00:59:22.739 --> 00:59:53.110
heartfelt desire to serve in the foreign language field.

00:59:53.110 --> 01:00:20.739
So, let's just take a moment and try to help you decide, because if you step on over,

01:00:20.739 --> 01:00:24.980
you'll be so happy you try.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:01:02.619
You got to step on over, because when you step on Sidoni, the preaching work is amazing.

01:01:02.619 --> 01:01:17.400
With oval wow music, sad bad, we'll drive in closer.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:02:26.849
Be there to be stepped on the way.

01:02:26.849 --> 01:02:31.869
Did you notice some of the blessings this couple enjoyed as a result of learning a new

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:33.670
language?

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:38.469
Not only were they able to expand their ministry and show their love for neighbor, but

01:02:38.469 --> 01:02:43.550
they also spent a lot of time together as a couple, reaching the goal of learning a

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:46.510
language as a family.

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:51.789
By working hard to build up and protect our family spiritually, we can all take part

01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:58.510
in glorifying Jehovah, the one to whom every family owes its name.

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:04.309
We'll also enjoy a Bethel Morning Worship that is now available on Video On Demand.

01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:08.070
It ties very well into the theme of this month's program.

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:14.150
The video is entitled Practice Godly Devotion in Our Own Household, and is presented

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:20.070
by Brother David Schaefer, a helper to the Teaching Committee.

01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:25.829
But we have more in store for you, we're also pleased to announce the release of a new

01:03:25.909 --> 01:03:32.429
brochure entitled, Answers to Ten Questions Young People Ask.

01:03:32.429 --> 01:03:39.730
The content of this 32-page full color brochure is based on articles in awake and the

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:45.829
two volumes of questions young people ask, answers that work, as well as the young people

01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:50.349
ask articles on the JW.org website.

01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:55.630
This new brochure will be particularly helpful to those who speak a language in which

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:58.389
that material is not available.

01:03:58.389 --> 01:04:04.769
However, all young people can benefit from this new brochure because the original articles

01:04:04.769 --> 01:04:08.429
have been updated and rewritten.

01:04:08.429 --> 01:04:12.710
Each section of the brochure addresses one question.

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:18.510
After stating the question, the section begins with a pointed statement under the feature,

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:20.349
why it matters.

01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:27.429
Saying the reader know why that question is relevant, then what would you do scenario

01:04:27.429 --> 01:04:34.230
is presented, putting the reader in a hypothetical situation related to the topic.

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:40.510
After discussing various principles, scriptural advice directs the reader to the best answers

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:43.469
for that particular question.

01:04:43.469 --> 01:04:48.670
The ten questions brochure is interactive, allowing the reader to write responses to the

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:51.269
various questions presented.

01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:55.710
The final topic, how can the Bible help me?

01:04:55.710 --> 01:05:01.989
Is designed to invite readers who are not Jehovah's Witnesses to accept a Bible study.

01:05:01.989 --> 01:05:08.789
The brochure makes numerous references to the JW.org website and directs readers to more

01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:11.630
information that can be found there.

01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:17.710
Also, the brochure is designed in such a way that young people can be comfortable sharing

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:22.150
it with their peers and with others in the ministry.

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:30.590
This brochure is already approved for translation into 324 languages.

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:39.510
Of these languages, 223 do not produce a wake and 262 have not produced the young people

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:41.110
ask book.

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:47.349
So we expect that answers to ten questions young people ask will help many more use benefit

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:51.510
from the Bible's practical wisdom.

01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:57.030
Following this program, digital formats of the brochure will become available on the JW.org

01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:04.590
website, the JW Library Add and on Watchtower Online Library as they are produced in each

01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:05.590
language.

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:11.789
Additionally, printed copies of the brochure can be requested through your congregation

01:06:11.789 --> 01:06:15.750
at the conclusion of this program.

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:22.230
Before we finish, we'd like to share this postcard from the city of Liviv and Ukraine.

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:29.309
The city has approximately 800,000 inhabitants and is surrounded by beautiful forests.

01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:35.110
But Liviv is also the home of 5,000 of our dear brothers and sisters.

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:41.150
One of the 49 congregations in Liviv is the Populna-Centralna congregation.

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:47.349
This congregation has 107 publishers, including 42 regular pioneers.

01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:53.190
Last year, during the month of August, 70% of them took part in some form of pioneer

01:06:53.190 --> 01:07:00.389
service, despite the fact that this congregation has the smallest territory in the city.

01:07:00.389 --> 01:07:05.550
Public witnessing using carts has proven very effective, and the publishers also cover

01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:10.269
remote territories and small villages outside the city.

01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:17.510
The publishers of the Populna-Centralna congregation send their warm Christian love to all of

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:20.789
us worldwide.

01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:24.510
This is JW Broadcasting from Brooklyn, New York.
