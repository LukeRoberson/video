00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:12.539
The preaching work in Turkey has experienced a period of exciting growth.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.539
The old branch facilities in Istanbul became too small for the increasing needs.

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:26.300
So our brothers found two floors in an office tower that would provide suitable workspace for Bethel departments.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.300
A nearby residential building provides accommodations for the Bethel family.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.299
To celebrate the dedication of the new branch facilities, delegates from all over the world came to Istanbul.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:43.299
Special events and activities were organized to welcome them.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:51.299
And on May 12, 2018, Brother Mark Sanderson of the governing body gave an encouraging branch dedication top.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:01:15.099
In the first century, the Apostle Paul wrote about this part of the world that the good news was bearing fruit and increasing.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:18.099
The same is true today.

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:21.099
The need for kingdom proclaimers here is great.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:30.099
And with a new branch dedicated to supporting the preaching work, our Zellis brothers in Turkey are sure that Paul's words will continue to prove true.
