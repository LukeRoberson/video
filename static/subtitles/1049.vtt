00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.289
Proverbs chapter 10 verse 22 states it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes rich and he adds no pain with it

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:15.490
Jehovah blesses those he loves with gifts of divine approval guidance and spiritual prosperity and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.289
When we enter a door of kingdom activity in faith

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.649
We are putting ourselves in line for a rich blessing from Jehovah

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.649
One of those doors is this school for kingdom evangelizers

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.570
Now what just came to your mind when you heard that school?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.689
Did you think well that's a great school if you have special circumstances to apply for it or

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.969
I'm too old for that or I'm too young for that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.009
I'm already serving with the need is great. I'm needed here

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.810
They could send me anywhere after the school and I'm not really comfortable with that

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.170
Those are honest feelings and understandable

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.010
But we want to be careful that feelings don't turn into stumbling stones that would prevent us from receiving a blessing from Jehovah

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:14.290
Let's use Timothy as an example of one who entered a door of kingdom activity and received Jehovah's rich blessing

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.689
Timothy received a personal invitation from the Apostle Paul to expand his ministry

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.170
At first glance the two men probably looked nothing alike. So imagine that scene

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.689
Paul was older a man of experience

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.129
Timothy was young probably in his late teens or early 20s

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.849
Paul was bold in his speech tireless in his ministry and resilient to opposition

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:45.730
Yet on the other hand the Scriptures indicate that young Timothy was perhaps shy

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.049
hesitant and lacked self-confidence

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:57.010
What's stumbling stones could have existed in Timothy's mind as he pondered Paul's

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.450
invitation

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.290
Well, let's open our Bibles to 2 Timothy chapter 3 and read verse 10 and 11 and we'll find out

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.849
2 Timothy chapter 3 and we're going to read verse 10 and 11 now notice that Paul wrote this to Timothy many years later

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.210
But let's see what we can learn

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330
verse 10

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.169
But you have closely followed my teaching

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.889
My course of life

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.849
My purpose my faith my patience my love my endurance

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.050
The persecutions and sufferings such as I experienced in now notice

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.210
Antioch and Iconium and in

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.050
Listera

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.050
Now where was Timothy from

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.250
Listera

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:53.009
The young man likely witnessed how Paul suffered ruthless beatings in Listera at the hands of opposers

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.689
Can you feel Timothy's possible hesitation as he now looks at Paul extending his hand out to him

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.849
Perhaps even eyeing the scars of Paul and Paul says come with me

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.289
Timothy had to wonder if I go with you. It's not going to be easy. Well, I suffer as you suffered

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:26.569
Another possible stumbling stone for Timothy was the fact that he was already serving in a capable way in the newly formed congregation in Listera and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.330
Was well reported on by the brothers and now Paul was asking him to leave it all including his family and friends

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.490
Timothy could have reasoned they need me my mother needs me my grandmother needs me here

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.250
Maybe I can join Paul in a few years when I gain more experience and

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:54.090
Perhaps yet another stumbling stone for Timothy could have been the fact that he did not know where his assignment would take him

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.729
Listera was a small rustic town secluded in a valley

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.090
He knew the people the landscape the food the language the culture

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.449
Timothy knew that accompanying Paul met venturing into the unknown

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.210
He had to wonder and I really ready for this

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.970
I have a weak stomach and it's already feeling weaker just thinking about going with Paul

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.490
Can you see yourself in Timothy?

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:26.850
He no doubt had some real concerns before accepting Paul's offer

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.250
But what did Timothy's faith allow him to see?

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:35.209
Well, let's read again Paul's words at

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:39.610
Second Timothy this time verse 11, but verse 11 B

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.550
Second Timothy chapter 3 verse 11 B I

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:53.839
Endured these persecutions and now note this and the Lord rescued me from them all

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.879
Timothy witnessed first hand how Jehovah rescued and strengthened Paul

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:09.120
So yes in faith Timothy did enter the door of activity and he had worked with Paul together for many years

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.519
But think of the blessings he received because of his decision to join Paul

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.040
He observed how Paul navigated through each trial

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.759
How Paul kept his inner peace

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:27.439
Timothy saw not just the inconveniences or the sufferings of Paul

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:34.360
But he had observed Paul stabilizing joy and he witnessed how Jehovah helped him each step of the way

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:37.839
With Jehovah's help

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:41.079
Timothy stretched beyond his somewhat shy hesitant nature

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.680
To reach his full potential as a zealous

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.240
Overseer in support of the truth

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.379
Now in the following video note what reasoning helped Gabriel

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.379
Decide to apply for the school for Kingdom evangelizers

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.029
At our convention they had the meeting for the school for Kingdom evangelizers

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.550
My friend Anton asked if I was going to go

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.670
Thank you, Bill. Hey Anton. Are you coming?

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.709
To what the ESK meeting? Oh, no, I wasn't planning on it, but

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:32.750
All right, yeah sure I'll go okay then I left or is that I went but I felt

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.149
Conflicted I thought I already have an assignment one that I love

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.709
But I didn't fully understand the incredible privilege of attending ESK

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:50.860
I asked the circuit overseer a few more questions and it felt like

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.819
This is it it seemed right and all I had to do was apply online

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:01.459
That was months ago

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.420
Saw us holding you back. I feel like Jehovah led me here and I've never been happy yet

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.579
But now another door's opened and the fears back

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.980
It doesn't matter how far you've come fear of the unknown could be overwhelming

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:25.819
Sometimes you need a reminder that Jehovah's leading you're in the right direction. Here's one to keep in mind

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.860
Philippians 4

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.860
13 read it

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:45.500
And just think about how far Jehovah's taking you for all things

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.300
I have the strength

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:50.939
Through the one who gives me pie

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:29.740
Jehovah is in control. What was I so afraid of? I'm bringing too much

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:37.860
Well, ESK is for two months. Oh, you were just a light you too bringing every last thing with you

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:43.679
Can I can I leave this with you?

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.440
It's been on a few adventures, but it's still great for travel

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.279
Really, yeah, please

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.559
Who knows you might need it sometimes soon?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:04.500
Did you notice how faith was shown?

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.620
Gabriel was in fear of the unknown

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:17.659
But Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13 touched his heart stirred his feelings and helped him to trust in Jehovah and move forward in faith

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:21.059
And apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:31.620
If you choose to enter through the door of SKE you will receive specialized training so that you can be used more fully by Jehovah and his organization

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.059
Remember it's not a leap of faith with no idea of how things might turn out

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:45.019
It is an informed decision with a guaranteed outcome of blessings from Jehovah

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:49.980
Will you trust that Jehovah will help you every step of the way?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:58.980
If so, like Timothy, you will experience first hand how the blessing of Jehovah makes rich

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:07.620
Brother Robert Lutcioni a helper to the publishing committee will now consider the next talk of this symposium

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.899
Enter the door to activity and faith assist with a theocratic building project
