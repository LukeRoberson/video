00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:16.260
My name is Dmitro Suhovcev.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:29.839
About ten years ago we moved here from Ukraine.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:42.380
My wife and I are deaf and our children are hearing.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.750
People often wonder if deaf people can drive, get married or is a family.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.289
But the truth is, we can.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:11.430
For work, I do carpentry and painting.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.510
What I have found the most helpful with raising my family.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.420
It is a regular study of God's work.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.900
I can see a difference in my husband.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:31.120
He is more mild and affectionate now to me and our children.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.680
We regularly take time to discuss a scripture from the Bible.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:53.120
We can see how it applies to our family.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.560
The Christian Greek scriptures were released in American Sign Language.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:16.139
Everything was so clear and we can use it to teach others.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:23.219
I am happier, my family is doing great and it is all because of studying the Bible in ASL.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:28.020
For me, reading the Bible is like watching a movie.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.219
When I see it in ASL, it is like being transported in the movie.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:37.099
I feel involved and in the middle of all the action.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.699
I get a lot more out of it than I do reading it because this is my language.

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.900
I love it and I could never be without it.

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:53.939
Our weekly congregation meetings are conducted in American Sign Language.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:59.139
When I see everyone signing, it just makes me happy that they know my language.

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.340
My parents' language, just like I do.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:32.780
Each meeting starts with a song and then is opened with a prayer.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:51.349
Scriptural points are discussed and at times the audience is invited to participate.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:59.150
People often wonder why deaf people use so many facial expressions and are so animated when they sign.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:11.169
Each facial expression is part of sign language grammar and carries much meaning.

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.569
As a family, the Bible has brought us even closer together.

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:29.819
Whether someone can hear or not, the Bible is truly helpful

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:36.220
when it comes to finding a job, raising a family and making good friends.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:05:00.259
Our family's life, having the Bible in American Sign Language,

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.660
has been the key to our family's happiness.
