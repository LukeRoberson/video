00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:06.879
Okay, pictures up quite on the set, please

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.500
It was a tremendous privilege to have a part in the production of the protocol returns

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.340
None of us are professional actors, so needless to say was a bit intimidating when it came time for lights camera

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.700
Inaction, but with the kind help of the brothers and sisters and they're coaching us in a kind and patient way

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.619
We were able to get into the role of our characters, which brings us to our cast and we'd like to get a few comments from each of them

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.820
Michael, we'd like to start with you. What are your observations?

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.820
Well, I got admitted it was kind of embarrassing playing bad news

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.859
Oh, you know I had to say and do these despicable things nothing that I would do in real life of course and

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.540
The thing that made Al especially bad is that he was a not a non-witness who's trying to leave David astray, but

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.939
He was a Christian who chose to turn his back on everything he knew

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.379
So I kind of had this fear that people would view me differently because I had to play that character

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.739
But then a brother reminded me first Kings chapter 22

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.099
We're touched about how an angel of Jehovah had to play a deceptive spirit

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.859
And he used that the full king a heb and entitled everybody a lesson. So Jehovah approves that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.140
What warning does the Al character make for us to benefit from?

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.859
Scripture that comes to mind is first Timothy 524

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.620
We're talked about how some men sins are manifest later

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:56.099
So I'll just like Judas started off as a worshiper of Jehovah, but his spirituality deteriorates over time

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.780
So you know in the congregation today you can have somebody who starts off all right

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.579
But they begin to live a double life their spirituality deteriorates and then they themselves become bad association

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.379
That's why it's really important that we watch our associations also within the congregation

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020
Thank you very valid point

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.819
Hannah and Bethany how about you?

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:19.419
Well

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:21.419
Sometimes I think on the surface it can be

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.139
The little hard to differentiate between a witness and a non-witness for example in the movie the characters that

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.620
Bethany and I played

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:36.699
They were fun they were friendly they were hardworking so and even their dress they were dressed really neatly and modestly

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:38.300
So at first glance

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.139
Maybe you could even see them fitting in really well in the congregation the kingdom hall

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.900
But um because of that it could be really easy to let your guard down with co-workers that kind of have that type of

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.979
Appearance but in the end because they don't serve Jehovah. They don't love Jehovah

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.139
They don't uphold his high righteous moral

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.699
standards and then

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.659
Really they didn't have David's best interests at heart

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:06.219
Yeah, it's very true. You know if we're at work we see co-workers dressing in modestly or they have very

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:13.740
Obviously attitudes lifestyle speech as a Christian our conscience would probably quickly dismiss them as bad association

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.939
And also we wouldn't be attracted to spend more time with them

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.580
But if on the surface they're dressing nicely they have a nice personality

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.259
They seem like good people reminding us even of people in the congregation

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.340
Then that's where the danger is we saw even with David and Taylor

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.060
Association just slowly crept up on him and so the more time that they spent together

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.500
They're more the thought their thoughts and their emotions got involved and that's what led to the trouble

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:47.659
But that David got into and so it just shows how careful we have to be and keeping close to Jehovah's love and also shows the subtleties of Satan's trap

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:53.180
Good point nice people are bad association if they don't live by Bible principles

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.460
Andrew what lesson can we learn from the older brother of the parable

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.699
Both the brothers had their flaws. We naturally see the protocol that way

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.620
After all he squandered his inheritance. He didn't care about spirituality for a time

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.819
But the older brother was flawed to the other extreme

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.300
He was doing everything right, but he allowed himself to come self-righteous and that's not good

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.300
And both the parable and in the video he didn't respond properly to his brother's sincere repentance

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.139
He wasn't merciful. He was rigid

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.220
And it's that sort of quality that led to him having that that heated argument in the garage

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.939
It caused him just to pride away at his brother when he came home late until he just snapped in the living room

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:37.180
So it shows the importance of really monitoring these invisible qualities that we might have even though we might be doing everything right at the time

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.060
Good lesson for all of us

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.459
Casey any subtleties you picked up on in the video?

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:46.620
Well, I actually thought that Hannah and Bethany brought out a good point

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:52.779
Sometimes we may hear a witness youth reason that their associates or non-witness co-workers

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:57.180
Are more fun or no worse than same members in the congregation

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.339
But the way they act doesn't necessarily reflect their their true morals and standards

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.540
So that association can be very dangerous

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.779
In the parable the prodigal he squandered his inheritance

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.819
He he got involved with prostitutes and he even went so far as to eat pig food

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.459
To survive really every aspect of of his life was affected and it spiraled downward

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.939
And the same can be said with David in the video

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.339
I mean we saw how his whole disposition changed the way he treated his family

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.459
He didn't uphold his moral standards and even in the little details in his life at home

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.540
We saw him hanging up his shirt his room was neat

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.100
But when he moved out he even lost that that good habit of cleanliness

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.180
So his association it really affected every aspect of his life

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:48.300
Anything else about his character?

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.259
I thought it was interesting that

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:56.220
After he spent all of his money he lost his job he wrecked his car he ended up in jail

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.420
That instead of going home and seeking the support of his loving family

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.459
That he turned to a non-witness co-worker and that's what really got him into trouble

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:12.860
And it was only after he seriously transgressed God's law that then his conscience plagued him and

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.180
And he returned to the support of his family

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.339
So for me it just showed me the importance of of seeking that out first

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.300
That's really an arrangement that Jehovah has put in place for us and to seek the support of that

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.339
How did the role of David affect you personally?

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.660
Well for me it

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.139
It impressed upon me the futility of succumbing to worldly influences

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.220
And really the hurt that it can cause to all involved

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.180
Even if the person does come back it really can be very damaging to a family

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.339
So my hope is that anyone that watches this video

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.220
And maybe heading in the wrong direction away from Jehovah

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:57.819
We'll be able to turn around and head back to Jehovah and really embrace the love and mercy that that he is put forth for us

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.779
Thank you for those insights

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.220
Joanne or lovingly known as mom how about you?

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:07.740
Truthfully I'm not a mom

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:12.699
My husband Randy and I served in the traveling work for 20 years

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.540
And for the past three years have been serving here at Bethel

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:21.899
So I teasingly say that I had to come to Bethel to get a house and kids

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.740
But seriously

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:27.899
Acting as the mom

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.100
It made me think deeply about all the different emotions that a parent must feel

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:41.100
When there's conflict in the home and especially when a child decides to leave Jehovah and the truth

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.060
In this case the family

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.779
The parents were doing everything they could

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:54.699
And still there were problems which led to so much anxiety and heart-wrenching emotional pain

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.139
I really respect parents in the congregation

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:04.060
That continue to stay loyal to Jehovah and maintain their spiritual routine

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.860
Especially when a child decides to

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.139
Behave badly or make wrong choices

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:16.779
It's really the close relationship that parents have with Jehovah that's going to get them through it

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:21.980
That is a good point and I really appreciate the way the script was written on that as well because

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:24.939
The father was so concerned about his boys

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:31.819
We had to maintain reasonableness and balance while not condoning the bad behavior or poor choices that were being made

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.740
We saw him

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.980
Admonishing David we saw him

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.620
consoling his wife

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.580
And also commending and reassuring his son James

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.700
Which we need to remember to commend Christian fathers when they find themselves in such a

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:54.620
Challenge because they have to maintain their composure their good judgment and their fairness even though things aren't working out the way they think they should

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.700
Truly, I think no matter what a family member does to disappoint us at times

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.580
We should remember the key texts at Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 10 which says

00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:09.580
The joy of Jehovah is our stronghold

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.980
To any who are faltering spiritually or strained from the truth

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.340
We'd like to leave you with this text found at first Peter chapter 2 verse 25

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:21.820
Please

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.019
Return to the shepherd and overseer of your souls
