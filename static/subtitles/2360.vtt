00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:19.350
Speaking in a conversational manner means talking in a natural, sincere way that conveys how you feel.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.850
While this might sound simple, it can be a challenge when you're nervous.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.850
These four steps can help.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.850
Pray.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.350
Prepare carefully.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.350
Speak from the heart.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.850
Look at your listeners.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.850
This is important when we give talks and when we share in the ministry.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.850
Let's see why as we watch these examples of public witnessing.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.490
Take whatever you want. There's no charge.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.490
That's okay, maybe another time.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:04.569
Could the brothers' manner have been more conversational?

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.569
Well, he could have tried to make eye contact.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:13.569
What about his posture, gestures, and facial expressions?

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.569
Let's watch a better example.

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.569
Good morning.

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.569
You're welcome to take whatever you like.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:23.569
Thank you.

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.650
Do you think we'll ever see an end to suffering?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.650
I'm not really sure.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.650
If you have just a moment, I'd like to show you what the Bible has to say.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.650
Okay.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.650
A friendly manner opened the way to a conversation.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.650
It can also help when we're giving a talk.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.650
We should try to speak in our own words.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.650
Let's observe these examples.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.650
When Jesus was nailed to the stake in 33 CE,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.650
it hardly looked possible that he could have a kingdom at all.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.650
But in his preaching of the kingdom of God,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.650
he had not been a proclaimer of erroneous news.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.650
On the third day after his death,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.650
the founder of the kingdom made sure that the disciples of Jesus

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.650
would not be offering a prayer for a government that was not possible.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.650
Jehovah resurrected the one who was to represent him in the prayed for kingdom

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.650
and clothed him with immortality.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.650
Did you understand the words of the speaker?

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.650
Most likely.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.650
Was it spiritual food?

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.650
Yes.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.650
Was he using conversational manner?

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.650
Not really.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.650
Could he have had more eye contact with his audience?

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.650
Yes.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.650
Let's watch the speaker present the information in his own words.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.650
Jesus preached about God's kingdom and taught his followers to pray for it.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.650
But when he died in 33 CE,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.650
they may have wondered if the kingdom really would come.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.650
Any doubts they had were erased.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.650
Three days later, when Jehovah resurrected his son,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.650
the future king of his kingdom.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.650
A natural, sincere delivery is more appealing.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.650
It holds people's attention, puts them at ease,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.650
and makes them more receptive to what you have to say.
