00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:09.269
Qualified trained brothers and sisters are needed everywhere within God's organization today.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.710
We need them to preach the good news. We need them here at World Headquarters.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.989
We need them at branch offices all around the world. We need them on construction projects,

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.510
as well as in our own local congregations.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.789
Well, that means that we all need to think about what we personally can do to train others.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.509
It also means, of course, that we need to be ready to be trained.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:42.270
We need to open our minds and hearts so that we can accept training, so that we can become more valuable to Jehovah.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.909
But when it comes to being trainers, our Heavenly Father, Jehovah, sets the most beautiful example for us.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.750
Really a perfect example in being a trainer.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.509
And this morning, I thought it would be good for us to consider just for a few moments how we can imitate Jehovah

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:02.109
as a trainer.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:11.709
Now, in John chapter 5 in verse 20, Jesus drew attention to how Jehovah trained him personally.

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:16.989
And in that one little verse, we can learn three important lessons about training.

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:18.269
So let's give it our attention.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:25.750
Would you open your Bibles? Let's read together a John chapter 5 and verse 20.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:37.549
Now, you notice it says, for the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all the things he himself does.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.750
And he will show him works greater than these so that you may marvel.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:54.349
Well, now let's go back over this verse and see if we can find these three different lessons that we can learn about Jehovah as a trainer.

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:00.310
What's the first one? Well, Jehovah trains others because he loves them.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.790
Do you see what Jesus said for the Father has affection for the Son?

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.270
When how is training and expression of love for others?

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:21.870
Well, of course, training allows individuals to gain the experience that they need in order to be effective in their work,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.389
to be productive, and of course, if you're effective and productive, well, how do you feel?

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.870
Well, of course, you have real joy.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:39.909
We think back to what Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 30 says when it describes Jesus as the master worker.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.030
Do you remember what it says there?

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.189
It says, I was the one he was especially fond of day by day.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.270
I rejoiced before him all the time.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.389
Well, why?

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:58.349
Why could Jesus rejoice all the time before his Heavenly Father?

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.750
Well, he had been well-trained to do the work that Jehovah had instructed him to do.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.590
Well, when we give training to our brothers and our sisters when they give new assignments and new jobs

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.430
so that they can be effective in their work, well, they rejoice too.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.349
But have you ever had the other experience?

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.830
Have you ever been given a new assignment and you've not received adequate training?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.990
Well, immediately, what could have been a joy becomes a terrible trial?

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.590
Because you may not know how to accomplish the task that's been set before you.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.949
Well, we can overcome that by showing love to the people that we're training, helping them,

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:48.550
so that they can be very effective in their task.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.349
Well, what's the challenge that may occur here?

00:03:52.349 --> 00:04:00.389
Many of us have years of experience in doing our jobs and doing the work that we do either at Bethel or in the congregation.

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:06.909
And it means that we have to resist the temptation to take on all the responsibility ourselves

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.030
or to want to do all the work ourselves.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.509
We need to allow younger people to be included.

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:22.629
We have to allow them to learn and to benefit from our experience so that they can grow up

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.589
and take on more responsibility.

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:34.189
If we're being honest, we have far more work than we can possibly accomplish in our own might and strength.

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:39.670
And so love moves us to train others so that they can help.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.269
Do you remember what Jethro said to Moses in Exodus chapter 18 and verse 18?

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:52.990
He said, you will surely wear out both you and this people who are with you.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.149
Because this is too big a load for you and you cannot carry it by yourself.

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.149
Well, that's true.

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:05.069
And so it's not just love of others that moves us to train.

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.069
It's even love of self, isn't it?

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.230
Because if we don't train others, we will give out.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.189
We won't be able to carry the load personally.

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.709
What's the second lesson that we learned from John 520?

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:21.029
Well, look at that second expression.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:28.910
Jesus said, and shows him all the things he himself does.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.350
Well, what's the point?

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:39.509
Well, obviously, Jehovah took the time to show Christ Jesus all the things that he himself does.

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.870
Well, what's the point?

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.470
We want to work closely with others and we want to show them all the things that we know,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.790
all of the things that we've come to learn.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:06:00.110
And this lesson is not just applied by Jehovah when he deals directly with one person like he did with Jesus,

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.589
but this kind of thinking governs all of the dealings that Jehovah has with mankind.

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:10.750
Take, for example, Exodus chapter 35 and verse 30.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.949
Now, look at this example.

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:18.509
Now, here, the work of the construction of the tabernacle had to move forward.

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.550
Now, how did Jehovah choose to handle it?

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.990
Let's look.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.910
Then Moses said to the Israelites,

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:33.389
See, Jehovah has chosen Bezilell, the son of Uri, the son of her of the tribe of Judah.

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:43.310
He has filled him with the spirit of God, giving him wisdom, understanding, and knowledge of every sort of craftsmanship,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.990
for making artistic designs, for working with gold, silver, and copper,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:57.029
for cutting and setting stones, and for making all kinds of artistic wood products.

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:03.430
Now, in this regard, insight volume one, commenting on this verse, these verses,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:14.750
says that Jehovah used his Holy Spirit to increase and sharpen the abilities of Bezilell and a Holiab.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:24.470
But now, did Jehovah use that same Holy Spirit to increase the abilities of all of the workers who would work on the project?

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.350
No, instead, what did he do?

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.790
Now, look at verse 34.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:36.029
It says, and he has put into his heart to what?

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:42.750
To teach, he and a Holiab, the son of a Hisomac of the tribe of Dan.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:49.750
So, Jehovah not only gave Bezilell and a Holiab abilities with craftsmanship,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.670
but he also gave them the ability to teach others.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:03.750
Now, brothers, what if you have developed some skill or some particular knowledge in some areas of the work?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.750
Learn from the example of Bezilell and a Holiab.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.949
Give the credit, give the glory to Jehovah for what you know.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:20.829
But honor Jehovah by teaching and training others to do all of the things that you're able to do.

00:08:20.829 --> 00:08:27.509
Now, for example, what if you're an Overserat Bethel or you're an elder in the congregation?

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:31.430
How wise you are if you take a moment and ask yourself,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:38.429
are there tasks that I'm presently caring for that I don't need to do personally?

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:43.309
Could my assistant or some other brother care for these assignments?

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:48.789
Well, now that's true at Bethel, but it's also true in the congregation.

00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:55.870
We want our brothers who are moving ahead to feel that they have a place in the congregation,

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.990
that they're being trained.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.389
This is true even of our young ones.

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:06.549
You know, sometimes the elders in the congregation can be so inventive in thinking of little assignments

00:09:06.549 --> 00:09:14.230
that can be given to our young children who have the potential in the future to take on more responsibility.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.429
And how does it make those young ones feel?

00:09:16.429 --> 00:09:23.789
Well, they just look forward so much to coming to the Kingdom Hall because they feel they have a place.

00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:28.429
Well, now what's the third lesson that we can learn from John 520?

00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:33.870
It says, and he will show him works greater than these.

00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:37.350
Now, what can we draw out of those few words?

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:46.190
Well, Jehovah trained Jesus with the thought of him taking on greater responsibility in the future.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.029
Well, we want to do the same.

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:54.789
We want to help others to be able to grow and take on larger responsibility in the future.

00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:58.830
For example, do you ask yourself questions like this?

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:07.110
Who has the potential to be the next overseer, or the next assistant overseer, or the next crew leader,

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.509
or the next ministerial servant, or the next elder?

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:19.669
And if they're to have those assignments, what training do they need right now so that they can reach those goals?

00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:27.549
We want to imitate Jehovah, and we want to look for opportunities so that we can help younger ones

00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:34.269
to move ahead so that in the future they can take on those larger responsibilities.

00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:40.190
You know, back in 1936, Brother Brotherford received a letter from a brother.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.470
This is what it says. This is a letter we have in our files.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:56.230
It says, my dear sir, my son Milton will be 19 in August, and would like to work in the factory of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.909
He'll be glad to work at any assignment that has given him.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:06.669
Thank you for your kindness in the past. Yours very truly, Herman Henshel.

00:11:06.669 --> 00:11:12.830
Well now, when Brother Brotherford got that letter about this 19-year-old young man named Milton,

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:18.110
well, did he foresee all the things that Milton Henshel would accomplish in his lifetime?

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.269
Well, maybe not.

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:30.750
But someone had the good sense to train that young man so that in time he could take on a large amount of responsibility

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.750
and even serve as a member of the governing body.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.909
Well, Brother, what do we learn?

00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:44.990
If we're motivated by love to train others, if we work closely with them, to teach them all the things that we know,

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:54.110
and if we train them with a view to taking on more responsibility, then we will be imitators of our Heavenly Father Jehovah

00:11:54.110 --> 00:12:02.830
and will be directly involved in filling the need for qualified men and women that exists around the world.
