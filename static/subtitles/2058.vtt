00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.960
The Krasnoyarsk-Gilesnodarosny district court has begun consideration of the criminal case

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.039
against Andrei Stupnikov, a peaceful believer accused of extremism.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:21.519
He is accused of a crime under Article 282.2 Part 1 of the Criminal Code, namely organizing

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.679
the activity of an organization that has been liquidated by a court decision for carrying

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.399
out so-called extremist activity.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.880
Andrei Stupnikov was not one of the founding members of such organizations and was never

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.640
a member of any of their agencies.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.960
The religion was not banned.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.399
This was specifically pointed out by the court that ruled to liquidate the legal entities,

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.560
but the indictment states.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.679
Andrei Stupnikov took steps to maintain and increase the number of followers or the

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.159
said religious teaching.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.320
Later religion cannot exist without followers who profess certain beliefs.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.840
Andrei and Olga have been married for 27 years.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.920
They say Bible knowledge makes their lives strong and happy, but on July 3, 2018, their

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.439
happy family life was disrupted when Andrei was detained by the Federal Security Service,

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.760
FSB.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.340
My wife and I arrived at the airport at four o'clock in the morning.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.099
When we were at the check-in counter, the FSB officers approached us and said that I was

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:35.340
under investigation.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.180
Andrei was interrogated by the FSB, appeared in court and then spent eight months in pre-trial

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.180
detention.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.540
He was prevented from seeing his wife, officials tried to coerce him into incriminating himself.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.500
The authorities shouted and threatened that they could, for example, increase the charges

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.260
against me to include terrorism.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.659
And a difficult situation arose.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.500
For some time I stopped receiving letters from my wife, but I received letters from others.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.219
Then a man came and asked me, so what happened to your wife?

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:12.219
Do you know?

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.340
Later I realized why this was happening.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.180
They told me that I could return to my wife very soon if I agreed to cooperate or plead

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.659
guilty.

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.659
Andrei acknowledges that the presence of hundreds of fellow believers who came to court to encourage

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:34.180
him was a great support.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.300
To the discerning mind, it is obvious that law enforcement agencies have crossed all boundaries

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.340
by labeling peaceful, law-abiding citizens as extremists.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.780
It's clear that Andrei Stupnikov did not engage in any extremist activities.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.979
He did not incite anyone to violence or discrimination.

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.139
Much less employee violent means himself.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.620
All he did was meet with fellow worshippers, participate in religious services and share

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.060
his religious views with others.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.259
Why are such peaceful individuals being framed as criminals and imprisoned for six years?

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:17.580
There are many opinions on that question, one of which is that they are an easy target

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:25.300
for law enforcement officers who have caught us to meet in their battle against extremism.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.460
At present Andrei is home, his current pretrial restrictions prohibit certain activities.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.659
And although Andrei's life has changed a lot in the past year, he says that persecution

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.729
will not force him to renounce his faith in God.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:04:09.400
The judicial proceedings against Andrei Stupnikov are well underway and we will likely find out

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.319
very soon if the judge will render a fair and independent decision by acquitting a person

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.120
who simply believes in God.
