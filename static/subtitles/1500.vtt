00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.300
Do you long for a home of your own?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.339
Jehovah promised the returning exiles

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.380
that they would build and enjoy comfortable dwellings.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.300
Jehovah likewise cares for us,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:39.219
whether we lose our home or we are taken from it.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.259
Above all, true worship provides spiritual security

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:52.619
that is found nowhere else.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.619
The spiritual home we have now

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.740
reminds us that Jehovah will give us a physical place to call home

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:28.989
in the new world.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:38.290
They will build houses and live in them.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.450
How would you feel during a long journey

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.980
where you might meet wild animals and criminals along the road?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.579
Jehovah assured the returning exiles

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.859
that they would return in safety

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.219
and dwell in peace.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.780
In the spiritual paradise we enjoy right now,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.890
people who were once violent

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:25.620
have learned to be humble, loving and peaceable.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:38.659
Imagine the peace that will reign in God's new world

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:47.759
where we can wander this beautiful glows,

00:02:47.759 --> 00:03:03.060
explore every corner

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:23.139
and admire the handiwork of the true God with no fear.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.219
They will do no harm nor cause any ruin

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:37.990
in all my holy mountain says Jehovah.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:47.210
Clear instruction from Jehovah draws us close to him

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.300
and maintains spiritual health.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.009
While false teachings hold many in the grip of spiritual darkness,

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:19.639
Jehovah offers true freedom.

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.379
The spiritual health we enjoy now

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:36.589
reminds us that perfect physical and mental health

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:47.620
await us in paradise.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.110
Imagine waking every day,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:02.199
feeling clean, healthy, happy

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:21.750
and full of the joy of life.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.069
Jehovah promises no resident will say,

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:33.980
I am sick.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.939
Jehovah fulfilled his word to the exiles.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.300
He restored that ruin nation

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.819
as if bringing it back to life.

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:55.339
In 1919, Jehovah did something similar.

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:57.379
He released his modern day people

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:02.149
from spiritual captivity

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:10.720
and energized them to preach.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.279
Just as Jehovah raised his people from figurative death,

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:41.399
so will he reverse the effects of literal death?

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:51.420
Indeed, God will swallow up death forever.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:07:16.439
Imagine living longer than any tree.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:18.040
Death will be no more.
