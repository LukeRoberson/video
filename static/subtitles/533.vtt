00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.820
Our theme is a very interesting one about the spiritual man, now he examines all things.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.500
It's the spirit of God that makes a Christian into a person who stands out as different

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.260
from those who are part of this world.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.739
So with that in mind, read with me first Corinthians chapter 2, verse 12.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:34.140
Through the scripture states, now we received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.179
that is from God, so that we might know the things that have been kindly given us

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.460
by God.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.060
The spirit that we receive from Jehovah God is his active force, and we really must have

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.340
it if we're going to understand spiritual things.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.820
If we're going to appreciate the things that Jehovah God has kindly given us as the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.659
text states, has Jehovah spirit opened the door to kindly give you and give me wonderful

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.500
things?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.459
The kingdom, the ransom, the hope of everlasting life, a new world, the resurrection, these

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:22.299
are things that the spirit has revealed to Jehovah's people.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.659
Something else that we've received is the world-wide brotherhood, a really that we're

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.620
a part of, and when you examine the world-wide brotherhood, it becomes very evident.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.500
It could never exist apart from Jehovah God's spirit.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.620
No way could man bring about such a brotherhood.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.620
Now let's read verse 13, verse Corinthians 2, 13.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.620
It says, these things, that is the things he has given us, we also speak not with words

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.700
taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the spirit as we explain spiritual matters

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.739
with spiritual words.

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:10.939
We focus on spiritual things.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:17.099
The sum total of human experience and wisdom, its writings, philosophies, and teachings

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.860
are, as Jesus said, of no use at all to gain everlasting life.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.099
That's John 663.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:35.620
Spiritual matters and spiritual words are found right here in God's Word, the Bible.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.979
And our vocabulary is different from the words for the world's way of speaking, which

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:45.580
is becoming more and more vulgar and disgusting.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.219
Our speech centers on spiritual matters, Jehovah's will, and so we explain the spiritual

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.620
matters that we understand from the scriptures with spiritual words.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.740
And in the end, we give glory to Jehovah by doing so.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.780
And now let's read verse 14, there it says, but a physical man does not accept the things

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.539
of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot get to know them because

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.300
they are examined spiritually.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.379
When it speaks of a physical man, it's not speaking about a person with a fleshly body,

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.860
because after all, Christians living today, on this earth, we have fleshly bodies, but

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.900
it refers to a person who has no spiritual side to his life.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.659
And there are many who fall into this category.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:48.300
Some of them are humanists who seem to be people who really want to do what is good.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.500
They want to help people.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.780
Their main pursuit is the welfare of people.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.340
But does that make them spiritual?

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.580
No.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.259
The spiritual man knows that to love his neighbor as himself is the second commandment.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:10.659
Most of the only thing they follow, but the main thing, the first commandment, the most

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:17.100
important one, is to love Jehovah God with your whole heart, mind, soul, and strength.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.540
And this is something that the humanist does not follow.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.699
What about atheists, agnostics, and evolutionists?

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.899
As we studied recently, many people embrace evolution, not because they have really studied

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:35.459
things and they're convinced by certain things they consider to be facts.

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:36.459
No.

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:41.939
They've been told by someone that it's true and so they accept what they've been told.

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:46.540
And on the other hand, there are died in the wool atheist and evolutionists who embrace

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.579
theories that if those theories they embrace were applied to any other discipline or aspect

00:04:52.579 --> 00:05:02.180
of life, they would not be considered anything but fantasy and wild imagination.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.560
And that's the truth.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.199
Some physical men ridicule believers in God and say, well, your belief in God is just

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.519
a crutch.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.600
I don't need a crutch.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.120
Well, you do need a crutch.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.360
That's the truth of the matter.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.600
You're mortal.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.319
All of us are mortal.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:26.279
And we need help in the sense that we need divine intervention, help from Jehovah God and

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:31.079
he provides it through the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:34.319
So we understand why the physical man acts the way he does.

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:40.560
He shuts his eyes to the overwhelming facts of creation, the obvious intelligent design

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:50.000
of DNA, the fine tuning of the forces, the four forces evident in the universe, Earth's

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.560
marvelous cycles that maintains it, the precise placement of Earth in the solar system,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.000
the wonderful symbiotic relationships in the plant and animal world and so much more

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.639
that make it very obvious, the wonderful, the marvelous intelligence that Jehovah God

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.279
exhibits in creation.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:23.199
But as 1 Corinthians 2.14 says, and we read it, a physical man does not accept the things

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.160
of the Spirit of God.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.800
And what's interesting, he looks at just the physical things.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.920
And yet it's the Spirit of God that created the wonderful physical things, but he's blind

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.920
because he can't see beyond them.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.120
It's like a man who admires a beautiful painting, a marvelous work of art, and he

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.879
purchase it for his home and he praises the artist.

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.720
And then he wants to see the scene or the site where the artist did his work.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.519
So he goes to the mountains where the lakes are and the mountains are the trees, the wildlife,

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:58.040
and he observes these things and he is awestruck with their beauty.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.079
And he praises the artist.

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:04.759
He doesn't say anything about the one who did the original.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:10.000
He's blind and that's how it is with a physical man.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.720
1 Corinthians 2.15, that verse says, however, the spiritual man examines all things, but

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.240
he himself is not examined by any man.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.839
The spiritual man is not one who all day long wears a sanctimonious or religious expression

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:31.360
on his face.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.079
He's not like a self-righteous Pharisee.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:40.160
The spiritual man is capable of admitting when he makes a mistake.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.680
His first thought is not to save face.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.279
That his first thought is really to be honest and open.

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:50.319
He knows his creator can see everything and knows everything.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:57.040
We are honest with ourselves and with others and we deal with situations with modesty.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.839
And what is more, the spiritual man is able to see the wrong position of the physical

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:04.639
man, the course of the physical man.

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:07.879
We understand the mental attitude of the physical man.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:11.339
We know what makes him tick.

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:15.740
However, the physical man does not understand the spiritual man.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:21.459
And just for a brief explanation, 1 John chapter 2 verses 15 through 17, which I won't

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:27.779
read at this time, but it gives a very brief description of the mental attitude and

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:31.339
outlook of the physical man.

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:36.500
A fact that cannot be ignored also is that Christendom's churches, as well as all religions

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:43.500
that are part of Babylon the Great, with their unscriptural teachings, unclean practices

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:50.899
and meddling in politics have played a major role in driving people away from belief in

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:52.779
the true God.

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:59.139
They have a great responsibility before Jehovah God because of the foolish, ridiculous

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:03.899
things they teach and their activities that dishonor Jehovah.

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:09.220
They have driven people to atheism and agnosticism.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:15.460
So how good it is to know the true God, Jehovah, to have been drawn to Him.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:22.220
And if you know the truth, you have been drawn to Jehovah God by His Holy Spirit.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:28.500
His invisible power that is so evident in all of creation and particularly in His word,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.340
the Bible.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.980
Spiritual men and women can see the unseen.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:41.419
We know who created the heavens and the earth and all that is in them.

00:09:41.419 --> 00:09:43.179
Our wonderful God, Jehovah.
