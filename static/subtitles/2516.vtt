00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:18.260
Jehovah made Jesus first, then the angels, but there was no sun, moon, stars, no earth.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
What would that be like?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
It would be something like this.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I can't see daddy.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:34.259
Jehovah created the stars, including our sun, and earth.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:38.259
But it did not look like it does now.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:43.259
In the beginning, there was nothing but one big ocean of water.

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.259
Until...

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:50.210
He made land appear.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:01:03.520
Then he made grass and trees.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.450
Don't worry my son, I will help you.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.209
Here you go.

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:20.620
Thanks dad. What about all the animals?

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:30.340
Yes, first he made sea life and the birds.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.010
Daddy, I'm flying.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.010
And do you know what Jehovah made next?

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.010
What?

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.010
He made all the animals that live on land.

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:52.900
And then he made people.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:01.450
Jehovah created the earth and everything on it.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.450
He made it beautiful.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.969
So we can enjoy it.

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.599
Once us to enjoy his creation, forever.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.599
Ready to see a prayer?

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.599
Let's thank Jehovah.
