00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:10.039
I received an offer to enter university to further my studies.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:16.760
So my teachers and friends tried to persuade me to just take the offer.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.440
Don't miss out on this golden opportunity.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.120
After we returned home from preaching or for meetings, women from our neighborhood

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.800
used to come to our home and say things like,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.439
why are you doing this to your child?

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:38.520
She is such a good girl and she studies so well.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.090
So why can't you send her to a good college?

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.700
So I asked myself, what would I like to do with my life?

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.179
When I saw brothers and sisters moving into my congregation to assist in the field ministry,

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:07.540
this helped me to set and pursue spiritual goals so that I could eventually pioneer in my congregation.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:16.250
In all things, my father always helped us to view Jehovah as a real person.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.329
Also, as for my mother, she serves as a regular pioneer.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.010
She shares the experiences she has had and the joy she has felt in the ministry.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.689
So soon after completing high school, I started pioneering.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.730
To live a simple life, I work on a vegetable farm

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.859
and this work provides me with income that is just sufficient.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.420
Even though this work is difficult and tiring,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.459
when I go out to preach

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.620
and when I meet with the Bible students as well as the young ones

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.099
who love and appreciate the Bible truth,

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.060
it refreshes my heart to see them.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.699
Their desire and their eagerness to learn about the Bible.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:15.379
Jeremiah 29-11 helped me to overcome pressures from others

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.219
with the firm belief that Jehovah is thinking of giving me a nice future

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:27.159
and a beautiful hope.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.919
Now I have four Bible studies and my father,

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.599
who is not a witness, also regularly attends meetings

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.969
and studies the Bible.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:44.969
All these blessings have helped me to see that this life provides true satisfaction

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:53.500
and true happiness. Choosing to serve Jehovah was the best decision

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.699
I have made in my life.
