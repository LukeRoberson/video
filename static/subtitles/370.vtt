00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.759
He was at ease with sophisticated intellectuals and with humble tent makers.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.759
He was persuasive to Roman dignitaries and to frigid peasants.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:20.120
His writings were motivating to liberal Greeks and to conservative Jews.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.420
That's how the December 1, 2005 issue of the Watchtower described the inspired writer

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.460
of today's text.

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:36.799
Certainly, the Apostle Paul was a master of becoming all things to people of all sorts.

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:39.880
Please open your Bibles to Acts chapter 20.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.240
We're going to read verse 21.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.640
With these words, Paul describes his commission as an apostle.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.640
As we read Acts 20 verse 21,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:58.159
notice the broad scope of his territory and also the purpose of his ministry.

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.479
He said, but I thoroughly bore witness both to Jews and to Greeks

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:09.379
about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:16.079
Like the Apostle Paul, we too have a commission to preach to people of all sorts.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.219
But is it too much to ask us to imitate Paul's example?

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.620
Think about it.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.900
Paul had the advantage of being well-educated.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.200
He was part of the privileged class of Roman citizens.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.319
He held a powerful position as a Pharisee.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.260
None of us has those qualifications.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.560
But are these the things that qualified Paul as a minister of the good news?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.359
It's true, has been a distinguished lawyer.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.040
No doubt helped him to defend and legally establish the good news.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.959
But on the other hand,

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.900
Paul's background created obstacles that he had to overcome.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.260
Only then could he preach to people of all sorts.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.340
Paul was a Jewish Pharisee, and that name Pharisee means separated one.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.180
This may refer to the fact that the Pharisees maintained a very strict separation from Gentiles.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.539
Then Jehovah picked Paul to be an apostle,

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.840
and to whom to the Gentiles.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.620
No doubt Paul had to do a lot of soul-searching to overcome his former prejudices

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.439
in order to carry out his commission to preach.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.280
Paul's need to make major changes.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.439
Reminds me of a man in North Carolina some years ago.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.379
He served as the minister of a large methodist church for over 25 years.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.780
Then he came into the truth.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.900
This man had preached hundreds, if not thousands, of sermons.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.500
With such a background, you would think that public speaking would be easy for him.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.740
And yet he said one of the hardest things he ever had to do

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.460
was to stand up in front of the congregation in the Kingdom Hall

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.860
and deliver a five-minute Bible reading.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.659
No doubt the Apostle Paul's example was a source of encouragement to this humble brother.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.460
Truly, the Kingdom Good News is a message for all peoples.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.159
But when it comes to preaching the Good News,

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:34.300
unlike many baseball caps, one size does not fit all.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.060
Like Paul to be effective, we have to be adaptable

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.819
in the way that we present the Good News.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.460
So let's consider three key qualities that helped to make Paul an effective minister.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.819
Paul was attentive, he was flexible, and he was resourceful.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.860
Consider how he was attentive.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.539
Paul understood the background and the beliefs of his audience.

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:08.780
Consider what happened when he was asked to appear before King Agrippa the second.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.979
Please open your Bibles to Acts chapter 26.

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.379
We're going to read verses two and three,

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:22.220
and we notice from these verses that Paul first commended Agrippa on his being well-versed

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.319
in the background of the people he was ruling.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.620
Acts 26 verses two and three.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.379
It says concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews King Agrippa,

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:39.939
I consider myself happy that it is before you I am to make my defense this day,

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:47.100
especially because you are an expert on all the customs as well as the controversies among the Jews.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.939
Therefore, I beg you to hear me patiently.

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.740
Paul was not trying to flatter the King.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.579
He was simply using his knowledge of his audience to establish a common ground

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.139
on which he could begin to preach.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.899
Paul was flexible.

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:13.500
Consider what happened when he and Barnabas entered the city of Listera to preach.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.540
The account is recorded in Acts chapter 14.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.019
The audience that they met there in Listera was totally different from that of King Agrippa

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:28.740
and the 100 dignitaries who may have been in the group with him.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:38.699
This crowd in Listera was made up of a less educated and more superstitious part of the population.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.100
When they healed a man who had been lame from birth, the crowd cried out,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.100
the gods had become like humans and have come down to us.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.939
They even wanted to offer up sacrifices to Paul and Barnabas.

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:58.420
Obviously, Paul could not reason with those people on the basis of their superstitions,

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.579
rather, he told the crowd that he and Barnabas were imperfect humans just like them.

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:09.060
And then he turned their attention away from puny humans

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.860
and directed it to the grand creation and our living God,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.579
the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them.

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:26.620
And that was enough to restrain the crowd from offering those sacrifices.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.339
A third quality of Paul was, he was resourceful.

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.500
If Paul had had the ministry schoolbook back there in the first century,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.500
we would probably say that he did well on point number 46,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.939
illustrations from familiar situations.

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:47.500
Paul used common, easily understood illustrations

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.620
to clarify complex spiritual matters.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.579
For example, the Romans were familiar with slavery.

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:02.420
In fact, many recipients of his letter to the Romans may have themselves been slaves.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.579
So Paul used slavery to illustrate the great change in ownership

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:11.819
that had taken place when these individuals became Christians.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:16.899
Roman 618 says, yes, since you were set free from sin,

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:21.500
you became slaves to righteousness.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.740
Our brothers around the world are showing themselves to be attentive, flexible,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.740
and resourceful as they preach to people of every background imaginable.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:37.379
For example, many people in the Far East are concerned about things that affect them personally,

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:41.740
such as health, child training, and education.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:47.220
So our brothers there effectively use those subjects to begin conversations.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.860
However, that may not work as well in certain cities in the United States,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:58.579
where people may be more concerned with corruption, traffic congestion, and crime.

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:03.379
But no matter what topic we use to introduce the truth,

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:10.660
to be effective Bible teachers, it is important for us to remain positive and encouraging,

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:17.500
and to stress the practical value of applying Bible principles.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:23.379
With the help of God's Holy Spirit, the Apostle Paul was able to overcome personal obstacles

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:28.500
and prejudices to become an outstanding minister of the good news.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:35.259
It's true we may not meet a Roman dignitary or a frigid peasant as we go about our territory,

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:40.980
but with Jehovah's help, we can imitate Paul's example of an effective minister

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:46.179
by being attentive, flexible, and resourceful.

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:48.299
Why do we make this effort?

00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:53.379
We do it because we want to become all things to people of all sorts

00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:57.820
that we might by all possible means save some.
