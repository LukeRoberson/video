00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.940
Why is it challenging to use our gift of speech wisely?

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.939
Because something powerful constantly works against us.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.939
What is it?

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.939
Imperfection.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.940
The tongue is powerful. It can do much good.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.940
But because of imperfection, it can also cause much harm.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.940
This thought is well expressed in the Bible book of Proverbs.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.939
For example, Proverbs 12, 18 says,

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:37.939
Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of sword.

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:42.939
But the tongue of the wise is healing.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:45.939
In Proverbs 18, 21 states,

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:49.939
Death and life are in the power of the tongue.

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:54.939
Those who love to use it will eat its fruitage.

00:00:54.939 --> 00:01:05.219
Words have power, so we need to be careful about what we say and how we say it.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:12.219
Perhaps you can recall when someone spoke unkindly to you and hurt you deeply.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:19.219
On the other hand, thoughtful speech can mend an aching heart and heal friendships.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:25.219
Because of imperfection, we all have difficulty controlling our tongue.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.219
This was true even of the first century disciple James.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:39.219
He humbly acknowledged the challenge that all humans face in the third chapter of his inspired letter.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:47.219
Notice how James described this in James chapter 3 verses 3 to 6 and verse 8.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:57.760
If we put bridles in the mouth of horses to make them obey us, we guide also their whole body.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760
Look also at chips.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.760
Although they are so big and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.759
wherever the man at the helm is inclined to go.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:19.759
So too, the tongue is a small part of the body and yet it makes great brags.

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:24.759
See how small a fire it takes to set a great forest ablaze?

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.759
The tongue is also a fire.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:32.759
The tongue represents a world of unrighteousness among our body members.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:41.759
For it defiles all the body and sets the whole course of life on fire and it is set on fire by Gehenna.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.759
And verse 8.

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.759
But no human can tame the tongue.

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:52.759
It is unruly and injurious, full of deadly poison.

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:59.759
In addition to inherited imperfection, our upbringing could also be a factor.

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:08.759
The watchtower of September 15, 2006, page 21, paragraph 6, states.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:16.759
In addition to human imperfection, family environment plays a role in the misuse of the tongue.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:22.759
Some people were raised in homes where parents were not open to any agreement.

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:27.419
Without self-control, fears.

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:34.419
Despite such challenges, it is possible for each one of us to seek peace and pursue it.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:40.800
Jesus set a good example in using the gift of speech wisely.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.800
He used his speech to encourage and comfort others.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:54.800
While on earth he applied to himself the words, founded Isaiah chapter 61 verse 1, which states the following.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:05.370
The spirit of the sovereign Lord Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah anointed me to declare good news to the meek.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:15.370
He sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the wide opening of the eyes to the prisoners.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:25.370
As recorded at Matthew 12 verse 20, Matthew applies the words of Isaiah 42, 1 to 3, to Jesus.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.370
In Matthew 12 20, he stated,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:39.370
No bruised read will he crush, and no smoldering wick will he extinguish, until he brings justice with success.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.370
We learn an important lesson from such verses.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.370
Jesus recognized that the tongue has power, power to harm, and power to heal.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:05:00.370
The watchtower of February 15, 2015, page 13, and paragraph 11,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:08.779
thus stated that, quote, Jesus showed discernment in all he said and did.

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.779
Can we imitate Jesus more closely?

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:21.779
If so, what will you do the next time an opportunity arises for you to use your gift of speech wisely?

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:42.699
In the following dramatization, notice how the wise use of the tongue helps to heal.

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:49.129
With your knees, especially this side.

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.129
Oh, thanks.

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.129
You've given me so many great ideas.

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.129
Yeah, but you make them.

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:07.399
I can't believe it.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.399
Oh, this is my song.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.399
Mine too.

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:15.399
You have a treasure place in your hopeless house.

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:17.399
He will help you.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.399
Ah, ah, ah.

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:21.399
Oh, he's like a drug addict.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:24.399
Oh, stop.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:26.399
I'll tell you who else thinks it was.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:27.399
Someone's like, you better give it to me.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:30.399
You're like, honey.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:32.399
Veronica, oh my goodness.

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:36.399
She's in love with her own voice.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:40.399
She's a visitor at the hall, like she's the only one that can seem.

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:44.399
And my first thought, oh no.

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:46.399
Here we go again.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.399
I've seen this movie before.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.399
You don't think she's showing off?

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.399
Is this just about Ellie?

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:56.870
Seems it's all about Ellie.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.870
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:08.279
I've lived it.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:12.279
If it's the case of her being more careful, how she comes across,

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.279
that's another matter.

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.279
What did she suggest?

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:20.279
I should tell her that she needs to stop.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:22.279
Can you believe that?

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:24.279
Especially as a pioneer.

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:26.279
What kind of example is this?

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.279
How quickly it snowballs out of control.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:34.300
You are such lonely.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.300
You've got nothing better to do.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:48.480
How difficult it can be to unravel.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.639
I shouldn't have judged you so harshly.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:59.660
I shouldn't have judged you at all.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.660
A chance to forgive is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.660
Think back to a time when you wanted forgiveness.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:24.310
Has anyone ever tried talking to her about her singing?

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.310
You know what I love about Veronica?

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.310
She's probably the most hospitable person I know.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.309
Always open-house at her place.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.309
And can she cook?

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.309
Have you tried her curry?

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:55.210
We should use our gift of speech to honor God and to benefit others.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:59.210
And if somebody gets angry at us,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.210
our mild reply can defuse the situation.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.210
As Proverbs 151 says,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.210
a mild answer turns away rage,

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.210
but a harsh word stirs up anger.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:19.210
We can also use our gift of speech to console and encourage others.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:25.210
1st Thessalonians 5, 11 and 14 states.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:30.210
Therefore, keep encouraging one another and building one another up,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.210
just as you are in fact doing.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.210
On the other hand,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.210
we urge you brothers to warn the disorderly,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.210
speak consolingly to those who are depressed,

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:47.210
support the weak, be patient toward all.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:53.210
Yes, even faithful servants of Jehovah may at times struggle with depression.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.210
How can we help such ones?

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:04.210
Off a specific genuine commendation to help them see their own value in Jehovah's eyes.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:10.210
Share with them the powerful words of Bible texts showing that Jehovah truly cares about

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:16.210
and loves those who are broken at heart and crushed in spirit.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:23.210
We can also use the power of our tongue to provide much needed encouragement to others.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:28.210
Has a fellow believer lost a loved one in death?

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:36.210
Some pathetic words expressing our care and concern can comfort a grieving heart.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.210
Is an elderly brother or sister feeling unneeded?

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:48.210
A thoughtful tongue can reassure older ones that they are valued and appreciated.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.210
Is someone struggling with the chronic illness?

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:57.210
Kind words shared on the phone or in person can do much

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.210
to lift the spirits of one who is sick.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:07.210
How pleased our Creator must be when we use the power of speech to other sayings

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.210
that are good for building up?

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.210
We may not be able to fix their problems,

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:20.210
but we can let them know that we love them and we care about them.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:25.210
For example, you can arrange to spend time with Him or her.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:30.210
Additionally, we can use God's word to strengthen them.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:36.210
Or you may notice that someone in the congregation is discouraged or depressed.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:42.210
You could read an encouraging Bible verse and even offer to say a prayer.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:49.210
We assure such ones that their brothers and sisters in the congregation love them.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:54.210
And speak in a way that shows that you really mean and believe what you say.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:12:00.460
This symposium has given each one of us much to think about.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.460
Has it not?

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.460
We have been reminded that seeking peace is not always easy.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:14.460
We have also learned that pursuit of peace requires effort.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:22.460
In what specific ways are you resolved to seek peace and pursue it in the days ahead?

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.460
May we all continue to pursue peace.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.460
One, by not quickly taking offence,

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:37.460
two, by apologizing, three, by forgiving freely.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:45.460
And four, by using our gift of speech wisely to encourage and comfort others.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:51.460
And may Jehovah, the God of Peace, bless you abundantly for doing so.
