00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:10.080
We welcome you to JW Broadcasting. This month's program is sure to encourage and build you up.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.080
My co-host is Gary Bro. Welcome Gary and please tell us what we can look forward to.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.079
Thank you, Garrett. We have plenty to enjoy in the program ahead.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.079
For example, if you've considered simplifying your life to do more in Jehovah's service,

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.079
you may be motivated by the prayerful steps this couple took to simplify their lives.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:39.079
We'll learn how brothers who live near large seaports witness from ship to ship and how Jehovah has blessed their diligent efforts.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:48.079
And if you are a loved one deal with a condition that makes it hard to concentrate at meetings, to study or enjoy family worship,

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.079
you'll appreciate this young brother who, despite his challenge, has come to love Bible study.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:19.340
This is the October program of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.340
Traveling through Central Italy, one can see many cities that have been built on the top of mountains rather than in a valley.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:36.340
In past centuries, this was often for strategic reasons, in case of war. Such cities were easier to defend.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.340
As you travel in the valleys now, you can see these cities from afar.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.340
This reminds us of Jesus' statements at Matthew 5, 14 to 16.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.340
In verse 14, he said,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.340
A city cannot be hid when located on the mountain.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.340
Jesus also said,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.340
You are the light of the world.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:09.340
People light a lamp and set it not under a basket, but on a lamp stand, and it shines on all those in the house.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.340
Likewise, let your light shine before men.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.340
In ancient Israel, oil lamps illuminated the homes, and an oil lamp was often kept burning throughout the night.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.340
Light is used in the Bible in a figurative way.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.340
Sometimes it is associated with truth.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.340
Some 43 verse 3 says,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.340
Send out your light and your truth.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.340
May these lead me, may they guide me to your holy mountain and to your grand tabernacle.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.340
Similarly, light is associated with God's Word.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.340
Some hundred nineteen verse hundred five says,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.340
Your Word is a lamp to my foot and a light for my path.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.340
Proverbs 6, 23 reads,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.340
For the commandment is a lamp and the law is a light.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.340
Also, progressively righteous conduct is compared to light.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.340
Proverbs 4, 18 says,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.340
But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.340
Even people are compared to light.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.340
Remember, Jesus said,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.340
You are the light of the world.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.340
So it is we as individuals that become the light of the world by what we do.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.340
This is in harmony with His statement at John 8 verse 12,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.340
I am the light of the world.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.340
How do we let the light shine?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.340
First, many understand that it means preaching the good news.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.340
Well, this is certainly one very important way of letting the light shine.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.340
Certainly, preaching and teaching is a fine work.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.340
To the Romans, Paul wrote in the Romans 15 verse 16,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.340
I am engaging in the holy work of the good news of God.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.339
But preaching is not the only way to let the light shine.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.339
What other ways can we let our light shine?

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.339
When Jesus said, let your light shine,

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:28.339
He was not specifically referring to preaching,

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:33.339
but to doing good to others by neighborly love.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:36.339
He said in verse 16 of Matthew chapter 5,

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:40.339
So that the people may see you find works

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:44.339
and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:50.339
Jesus said that it is by fine works that will let our light shine.

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:56.339
This is in line with Isaiah 58 verses 7 and 8,

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:59.339
where it says,

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:02.339
it is to share your bread with the hungry,

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:05.339
to bring the poor and homeless into your house,

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.339
to close someone naked when you see him,

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:12.339
and not to turn you back on your own flesh.

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:16.339
Then your light will shine through like the dawn.

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:21.490
Jesus, as the light of the world, did both.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.490
He let his light shine by means of preaching,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.490
but he also did so by means of doing fine works,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.490
doing good to others.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.490
Like Jesus, we let the light shine also by our Christian conduct.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.490
Jesus kept perfect balance.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.490
We too need to balance our preaching

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.490
with doing good to others and displaying Christian conduct.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.490
Jehovah's Witnesses everywhere are known for their honesty.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.490
They imitate the Apostle Paul who said at Hebrews 13, 18,

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.490
we trust we have an honest conscience

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.490
as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.490
They appreciate that such conduct gives glory to Jehovah God,

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.490
as Jesus said.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.490
Jehovah is the best example.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.490
In Eden, he proclaimed the good news that Satan would be crushed,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.490
resulting in paradise restored to earth.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.490
He proclaimed the good news to Abraham,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.490
that through Abraham all the nations will be blessed.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.490
But besides declaring the good news,

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.490
he also constantly does good to mankind.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.490
At Acts chapter 14 verse 16 and 17,

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.490
to people in Listera, Asian Minor,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.490
Paul and Barnabas said,

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.490
In past generations, he permitted all the nations to go on in their ways,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.490
although he did not leave himself without witness,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.490
and that he did good,

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.490
giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons,

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.740
satisfying you with food and filling your hearts with gladness.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.740
Jesus is a perfect example as well.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.740
Jesus not only preached and taught,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.740
but he also did good to others.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.740
He healed the lame, the blind, and the demon possessed.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.740
Acts 10.38 says,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.740
He went through the land doing good,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.740
and healing all those oppressed by the devil,

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.740
because God was with him.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.740
On one occasion, after preaching to a crowd,

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.740
Jesus twice performed the miracle of feeding thousands

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.740
with some fish and a few loaves of bread.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.740
He did not stop at preaching to the crowds.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.740
He did good to them by giving them food.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.740
We can also imitate him by giving food to those who are hungry.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.740
Can you children also do good to other children,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.740
besides preaching to them?

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.740
Yes, perhaps you can share some snacks with others

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.740
that might not have brought any to school,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.740
or whose parents are too poor to provide them with such.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.740
Or perhaps you have a nice piece of clothing

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.740
that has become too small for you to wear.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.740
Perhaps you can give it as a gift to someone in your class

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.980
or school that might have a need for it.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.980
Let's go back to letting our light shine by showing neighborly love.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.980
Let's first consider good works in the congregation.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.980
Many brothers let their light shine today

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.980
when the visit sick brothers and sisters

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.980
encourage the depressed and support the week.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.980
In Hebrews 1350, the Apostle Paul compares our public declaration

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.980
of Jehovah's name to a sacrifice.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.980
He says, through him, let us always offer to God

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.980
a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.980
that make public declaration to his name.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.980
That includes preaching.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.980
However, in the very next verse, verse 16,

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.980
he speaks of something else as also being a sacrifice,

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.980
besides preaching.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.980
He says, called,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.980
do not forget the doing of good

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.980
and to share what you have in a material way with others.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.980
For God is well pleased with such sacrifices.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.980
Tabitha, also called Dorcas,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.980
is mentioned in the Bible in a positive way,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.980
not necessarily for her zeal for preaching,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.980
but for making garments for others, acts of neighborly love.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.980
Acts 936 says,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.980
she abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.980
that she was making.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.980
She shared material things with others.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.980
Also today, many abound in good deeds,

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.980
other than preaching,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.980
we want to commend them all for letting their light shine.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:16.519
1 Timothy 5.9 and 10 speaks of widows,

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:19.519
having a reputation for fine works.

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.519
If she practiced hospitality,

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:24.519
if she assisted the afflicted,

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:28.519
she devoted herself to every good work.

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:31.519
There is not just one type of good work,

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:33.519
not just preaching.

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:35.519
We have many widows and other sisters

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:40.519
that have the reputation for fine works of different sorts.

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:44.519
We want to commend them all.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:48.519
We can also show neighborly love to those in need

00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:51.519
in times of disaster.

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:56.519
Again, the field ministry is not the only ministry for Christians.

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:59.519
There is also relief ministry.

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:04.519
Assisting others materially is a fine work and ministry.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:08.519
When Christians in Judea became impoverished,

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:11.519
relief campaigns were organized.

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:15.519
Of the Macedonian Christians in the first century,

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:18.519
it is said in 2 Corinthians 8.4,

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:22.519
they on their own initiative kept earnestly begging us

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:25.519
for the privilege of kindly giving

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:28.519
to have a share in the relief ministry.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:32.519
Greek Diaconia for the Holy Ones.

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:35.519
Just as preaching glorifies Jehovah,

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:40.519
Paul goes on to say that this relief ministry glorifies God.

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:43.519
2 Corinthians 9.13 says,

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:46.519
To the proof that this relief ministry gives,

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:49.519
they glorify God.

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.519
As we approach the great tribulation,

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:54.519
we do well to practice sharing things with others,

00:11:54.519 --> 00:12:00.830
as this may help them to survive the great tribulation.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.830
Another area of neighborly love is participation

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.830
in the construction of kingdom halls, assembly halls,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.830
remote translation offices, and branch offices.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:17.830
The construction of these is a holy ministry or sacred service.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.830
One pioneer said,

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.830
I have now been a regular pioneer for more than 20 years.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.830
I've kept myself busy in many avenues of the ministry,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.830
serving where the need is greater,

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.830
helping with kingdom hall construction,

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.830
and assisting with disaster relief work.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.830
Just as preaching is holy service,

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.830
so is participation in construction of kingdom halls.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.830
The organized to do Jehovah's will book says,

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.830
quote,

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.830
the construction of kingdom halls and assembly halls

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.830
is a form of sacred service.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.830
And then it asks,

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:04.100
are you in a position to assist in this aspect of sacred service?

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.100
Serving in battle homes is also an avenue of the ministry.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.100
Therefore, if one's share in preaching and teaching

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.100
is somewhat limited because of serving full time

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.100
in other avenues of holy service or ministry,

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.100
one does not have to have a bad conscience.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.100
Through these other forms of the ministry,

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.100
one is letting his light shine.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.379
We can also let our light shine by displaying neighborly love

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:34.379
toward non-witnesses.

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:38.379
In Jesus' illustration of the merciful Samaritan,

00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:43.379
he was emphatic that even though one is living at a distance

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:46.379
or is not a relative or an associate,

00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:50.379
the real neighbor is the one who will exercise the love

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:55.379
and kindness to another that the Scriptures commend.

00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:57.379
Jesus taught others not only to preach,

00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:01.379
but also to do good to them in a practical way,

00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:04.379
motivated by love and compassion,

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:08.379
in that famous parable of the neighborly Samaritan,

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:12.379
the Samaritan took care of a Jew that was robbed and injured.

00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:17.379
He treated his wounds, he took him to an inn

00:14:17.379 --> 00:14:20.379
and paid for his care for a couple of days.

00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:24.379
This parable touches many so that they think

00:14:24.379 --> 00:14:27.379
that this event actually happened.

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:29.379
It did not.

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:33.379
It was a parable, but a very effective one.

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:36.379
A man quoted the Scripture to Jesus

00:14:36.379 --> 00:14:39.379
that one should love Jehovah with his whole heart,

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.379
but also one's neighbor.

00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:43.379
The man then asked Jesus,

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:45.379
who is my neighbor?

00:14:45.379 --> 00:14:47.379
Greek, please see on.

00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:50.379
Jesus ended the parable by saying,

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:53.379
go and do the same yourself.

00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:58.590
We also want to do good to neighbors in need,

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.590
whether they have a false religion or no religion.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.590
We want to be as compassionate as the merciful Samaritan

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.590
in the parable, do we not?

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.590
Neighborly love was illustrated in the case of an elderly man

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.590
who wrote to a local paper about Mr. and Mrs. Nice Guy.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.590
He explained that his neighbors had been kind to him

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.590
when his wife was dying.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:29.590
Since she passed away, they have been super, he wrote.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.590
And then they have adopted me,

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.590
doing all kinds of chores and helping

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:39.590
to solve the problems of a 74-year-old retiree.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.590
What makes all this even more unusual is that they are black.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.590
I'm white.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.590
They are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.450
I'm a drop-out Catholic.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.450
When a hurricane hit an island years ago,

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:58.450
a lady who had her house cleaned by a witness team said,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.450
you have been coming to my door for a long time.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.450
And I thought of you as good neighbors.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.450
But this expression of neighborly love shows me

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:11.299
what your organization is about.

00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:14.299
When a hurricane hit the southern United States,

00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:18.299
a big tree fell on the rooftop of an elderly lady's home.

00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:21.299
She called the company to find out how much they would charge

00:16:21.299 --> 00:16:25.299
for taking the tree off and cutting it up.

00:16:25.299 --> 00:16:28.299
She was told $1,000.

00:16:28.299 --> 00:16:31.299
She did not have that money available.

00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:35.299
Later, brothers from another state came with their chainsaws

00:16:35.299 --> 00:16:39.299
to help our brothers living on the same street.

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:44.299
They also took down the tree from the elderly lady's house for free.

00:16:44.299 --> 00:16:47.299
A newspaper then wrote,

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:49.299
many don't like Jehovah's Witnesses

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:51.299
when they go from house to house with the Bible.

00:16:51.299 --> 00:16:54.299
But when they go from house to house with the chainsaw,

00:16:54.299 --> 00:16:58.509
they do like it.

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:01.509
Returning from a trip, a brother and his family

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:05.509
in a Latin country were a few months away from home

00:17:05.509 --> 00:17:10.509
when they saw a terrible automobile bill accident on the highway.

00:17:10.509 --> 00:17:13.509
They stopped to offer assistance.

00:17:13.509 --> 00:17:16.509
One of the drivers involved, a doctor,

00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:19.509
asked them to take his pregnant wife and two small daughters

00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:22.509
to the nearest hospital for treatment,

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:25.509
since police wanted to question him.

00:17:25.509 --> 00:17:27.509
The brother did so,

00:17:27.509 --> 00:17:29.509
and then the brother returned to the scene

00:17:29.509 --> 00:17:33.509
of the accident to see what further aid he could render.

00:17:33.509 --> 00:17:36.509
He told the doctor that he did not need to worry

00:17:36.509 --> 00:17:38.509
about his wife and children,

00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:40.509
for he would take care of them.

00:17:40.509 --> 00:17:43.509
With grateful tears in his eyes,

00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:48.759
he then turned his valuables over to the brother for safekeeping.

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:51.759
The brother and his family took the man's family home

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:55.759
with them and cared for them for several days.

00:17:56.759 --> 00:17:59.759
The doctor promised to study the Bible in his hometown,

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:03.759
and he said that if his wife gave birth to a son,

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:05.759
he would be named after the brother.

00:18:05.759 --> 00:18:11.039
Two years later, the brother visited the family.

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:13.039
They were studying the Bible,

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:18.630
and their little boy was named after the brother.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.630
Loving one's neighbor is most important

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.630
because it is listed as the second greatest

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:29.630
commitment in the Bible after loving Jehovah.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.630
When we do good to others,

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.630
the motive for doing so should not be just to have a better chance

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.630
to preach to them thereafter.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.630
It should come naturally to Christians to do good to others.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.630
We want to do good,

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.630
whether we can preach to them thereafter or not.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.630
We want to imitate our loving Heavenly Father

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.619
in doing the right and the loving thing.

00:18:56.619 --> 00:18:58.619
How about this one?

00:18:58.619 --> 00:19:01.619
Showing neighborly love to opposers.

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:04.619
Suppose you have an opposing neighbor.

00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:06.619
As you are driving down the road,

00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:08.619
you see that his car broke down,

00:19:08.619 --> 00:19:11.619
and there he is at the roadside.

00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:13.619
What are you going to do?

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:16.619
Pass by, pretending not to have seen him,

00:19:16.619 --> 00:19:18.619
or will you help if you can,

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:20.619
as suggested by the principle

00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:24.619
in the parable of the merciful Samaritan?

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:30.619
This is in line with Jesus' statement in Luke 633-35.

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:33.619
And if you do good to those doing good to you,

00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:35.619
of what credit is this to you,

00:19:35.619 --> 00:19:38.619
even the sinners do the same.

00:19:38.619 --> 00:19:40.619
Then he said,

00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:45.619
continue to love your enemies and to do good.

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:49.619
Even our enemies are our neighbors.

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:54.619
We may not love them in the sense of being found of them in Greek filia,

00:19:54.619 --> 00:19:59.619
but in the sense of principled love in Greek agapi.

00:19:59.619 --> 00:20:05.990
Even if we have to suffer or are being persecuted,

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.990
we continue to show neighborly love.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.990
First Peter 4, 19 states.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.990
So then let those who are suffering in harmony with the will of God

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:21.990
keep on entrusting themselves to a faithful Creator

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:26.589
while they are doing good.

00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:29.589
Jehovah also does good, not only to His servants,

00:20:29.589 --> 00:20:32.589
but to good ones and bad ones,

00:20:32.589 --> 00:20:36.589
giving them good things through nature.

00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:39.589
In review, how do we let our light shine?

00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:42.589
What fine works are we to produce?

00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:45.589
How can we show neighborly love?

00:20:45.589 --> 00:20:51.589
We do it by preaching, by doing good to our brothers in the congregation,

00:20:51.589 --> 00:20:54.589
by supporting relief campaigns,

00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:59.589
by doing good to non-witnesses, including opposers.

00:20:59.589 --> 00:21:05.589
We render sacred service also by supporting theocratic construction projects,

00:21:05.589 --> 00:21:09.589
and by serving at Bethel or caring for assembly halls.

00:21:09.589 --> 00:21:14.589
All this is included in letting our light shine.

00:21:14.589 --> 00:21:18.589
In the case of electrical light, there could be blackouts

00:21:18.589 --> 00:21:21.589
when everything comes to a halt or standstill.

00:21:21.589 --> 00:21:25.589
In our case, there will never be a figurative blackout because,

00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:28.589
a second Thessalonians 3.13 says,

00:21:28.589 --> 00:21:33.589
we will not give up in doing what is good.

00:21:33.589 --> 00:21:36.589
Our good works cannot be overlooked,

00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:40.589
just like a city on the mountain cannot be overlooked.

00:21:40.589 --> 00:21:45.589
They will not be overlooked because we will continue to let our light shine

00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:49.589
by multiple fine works, including preaching.

00:21:49.589 --> 00:21:55.589
Our light conquers the darkness of this world that is referred to in Isaiah 60 verse 2,

00:21:55.589 --> 00:22:00.589
and our good works glorify Jehovah.

00:22:00.589 --> 00:22:06.589
Our team looked for examples of those doing the fine works we just reviewed.

00:22:06.589 --> 00:22:10.589
They met an elder in Texas who led his light shine by showing

00:22:10.589 --> 00:22:14.589
loving concern for brothers and sisters who are ill.

00:22:14.589 --> 00:22:18.589
As David Slackman visits fellow witnesses in the hospital,

00:22:18.589 --> 00:22:24.839
notice what he considers to be the special blessings of his work.

00:22:24.839 --> 00:22:26.839
My name is David Slackman.

00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:31.839
I serve as the Chairman of the Hospital of the Aeson Committee in a Houston area.

00:22:31.839 --> 00:22:34.839
And the thing I like about the Hospital of the Aeson Committee

00:22:34.839 --> 00:22:39.839
is that I'm not there for any personal glory,

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:45.839
but rather I'm serving from the standpoint of helping the friends.

00:22:45.839 --> 00:22:47.839
I get a lot of phone calls,

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:51.839
and sometimes the phone calls may come in the middle of the night.

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:55.839
Sometimes the phone call may come during dinner time,

00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:59.839
but I'm serving Jehovah, I'm serving the friends.

00:22:59.839 --> 00:23:03.839
I don't care when it comes, I just want to help them.

00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:06.839
So when the call comes, the emergency is there.

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:11.839
I have this peripheral attitude that I have Jehovah's spirit to assure them

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:13.839
that Jehovah cares for them.

00:23:13.839 --> 00:23:16.839
When we're visiting with the patient,

00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:20.839
the patient is very glad to see us.

00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:26.839
And that immediately translates from their viewpoint that Jehovah is with them.

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.839
When we leave the hospital,

00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:31.839
and we know that the sisters have been comforted by our call,

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:37.839
it calls to mind what the Prophet said in Isaiah 40 in verse 11.

00:23:37.839 --> 00:23:39.839
It says, like a shepherd,

00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:42.839
he will care for his flock.

00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:44.839
Jehovah does care.

00:23:44.839 --> 00:23:50.839
And when we see that's what Jehovah does for the individual sheep,

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:52.839
and I'm able to try to imitate that,

00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:56.839
and also at the same time comfort the brother or sister,

00:23:56.839 --> 00:23:59.839
that's what gives me the greatest joy.

00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:07.119
Brother Slackman has been serving on the hospital A's on committee for 22 years.

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:12.119
Recall that he said his joy comes from imitating Jehovah's love for his sheep.

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:19.119
You and I can feel that same joy and satisfaction anytime we help a brother or sister in need.

00:24:19.119 --> 00:24:25.119
We also feel a sense of satisfaction when we put in the extra effort it takes to bring the good news

00:24:25.119 --> 00:24:28.119
to someone with unique circumstances.

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:30.119
Merchant sailors, for example,

00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:33.119
spend months at sea away from their families.

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:36.119
They're rarely at home and we call.

00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:38.119
So in busy harbours around the world,

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:41.119
witnesses invited to this special work

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:44.119
are going aboard ships with the Kingdom message.

00:24:44.119 --> 00:25:12.359
Hardware is a 24-7 economy,

00:25:12.359 --> 00:25:16.359
so you never know exactly when a sheep arrives.

00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:19.359
You have to be flexible in your schedule.

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:24.359
Just everything you can to meet the people there on board,

00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:26.359
especially when it is a return visit.

00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:30.359
You try to do everything you can to meet that person again.

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:35.359
We check one website where all the ships are depicted on a map.

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:39.359
We check if some of them are return visits.

00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:41.359
What nationalities are on board?

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:44.359
Once on the ship we go to the mess room

00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:47.359
and then it's a little bit like a metropolitan witnessing.

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:51.359
And we play some magazines over there.

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:54.359
We put a tablet over there with the website.

00:25:54.359 --> 00:25:59.359
In the 80s, we used a little card behind our bicycles

00:25:59.359 --> 00:26:03.359
to bring all the 80 languages of literature to the seaships.

00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:09.359
Sometimes we would come home tired at 10.30, maybe 11.

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:13.359
And then there was a message on the answering machine of a sailor

00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:16.359
saying, please Mr. Tydemann, come to our ship

00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:18.359
we're leaving in two or three hours

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:21.359
and we desperately need spiritual food.

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:25.359
And we would go right back on our bikes with literature.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:28.359
But in the winter time it was very hard

00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:31.359
because it was raining, it was very cold.

00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:33.359
And we had to bike for one hour.

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:35.359
But then we came on the ship

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:38.359
and then people were so nice and you were inside

00:26:38.359 --> 00:26:42.609
and then we could forget it.

00:26:42.609 --> 00:26:46.609
The JW Language app also proves very valuable in our ministry.

00:26:46.609 --> 00:26:49.609
When we have to wait for example in the restroom for the crew to arrive

00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:52.609
we use it to practice certain greetings

00:26:52.609 --> 00:26:55.609
or expressions in their mother tongue.

00:26:56.609 --> 00:26:59.609
The biggest challenge for us in the harbour field

00:26:59.609 --> 00:27:04.609
is a little bit like what I call the five minutes rule.

00:27:04.609 --> 00:27:08.609
What will you say if you meet a person once in your life

00:27:08.609 --> 00:27:10.609
and you only have five minutes?

00:27:10.609 --> 00:27:13.609
So what we have to do then is read a scripture,

00:27:13.609 --> 00:27:15.609
inform him about God's name,

00:27:15.609 --> 00:27:19.609
give him a beautiful tract, show him a video,

00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:23.609
all focus on the first five minutes in a meter person.

00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:27.609
And if we see how they react to Jehovah's purpose

00:27:27.609 --> 00:27:30.609
to make this earth a paradise again

00:27:30.609 --> 00:27:33.609
and that they would be able to be with their families,

00:27:33.609 --> 00:27:36.609
that that is Jehovah's intention from the start.

00:27:36.609 --> 00:27:41.609
That's very nice to see how they are comforted by the good news.

00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:45.609
I have seen so many times how Jehovah cares for the sailors,

00:27:45.609 --> 00:27:49.609
how he helps them, how he listens to their prayers.

00:27:49.609 --> 00:27:51.609
Sometimes when I was coming from the ship,

00:27:51.609 --> 00:27:54.609
I couldn't sleep from all the excitement on the ship.

00:27:54.609 --> 00:27:57.609
These are really the most beautiful years of my life.

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:05.140
I first got in touch with the trophy 1997

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:09.140
at Antwerp Harbour in Belgium.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:14.140
When Brother Tenney and Sister Nancy Skiri visited me.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.140
One of the topics that touched his heart

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.140
was the good news of the kingdom.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.140
And I remember once he told us that his personal name,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.140
Tal-Alele means good news.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.140
He applied promptly with the alert in his person life

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.140
and shortly thereafter he became an end-to-death publisher.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:37.140
And after some time he preached with us together on the ships.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.140
My love for the truth and the brotherhood got stronger.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.140
I was baptized in 2000.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:51.019
I now saving as a special pioneer on the island of Savai in Samoa.

00:28:51.019 --> 00:28:56.019
I am grateful that the brothers who visited us at the talk

00:28:56.019 --> 00:29:31.269
carried out Jehovah's Witnesses with zealously and faithfully.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:34.269
These brothers learn that harbour witnessing takes good planning

00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:37.269
and an adaptable spirit.

00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:40.269
If there is a seaport in your area that could benefit

00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:44.269
from this form of ministry, ask your congregation service committee

00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:50.579
what arrangement exists or could be set up by your branch.

00:29:50.579 --> 00:29:53.579
When we simplify our life, we're able to give more time

00:29:53.579 --> 00:29:56.579
to the fine works that Brother Loach discussed

00:29:56.579 --> 00:29:59.579
and that we've seen thus far.

00:29:59.579 --> 00:30:03.579
But seeing the need to simplify and then following through

00:30:03.579 --> 00:30:05.579
can be overwhelming.

00:30:05.579 --> 00:30:07.579
Many though have succeeded.

00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:09.579
And it's likely you know some in your area

00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:13.579
who were able to simplify with Jehovah's help.

00:30:13.579 --> 00:30:16.579
See how this couple recognizes the opportunity?

00:30:16.579 --> 00:30:19.579
Prayerfully makes the need of changes

00:30:19.579 --> 00:30:21.579
and is richly rewarded.

00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:26.299
Encouragement.

00:30:26.299 --> 00:30:28.299
It comes in many forms

00:30:28.299 --> 00:30:33.299
and it can affect our lives in ways we never imagined.

00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:37.299
The couple being interviewed were truly happy.

00:30:38.299 --> 00:30:42.299
They were enjoying so many blessings in Jehovah's service.

00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:48.079
Their secret?

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:51.079
They simplified their life.

00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:57.160
After that assembly, we really thought about how we could do more

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.160
to serve Jehovah.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:08.500
Working to maintain a pattern of life is exhausting.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:18.119
Even our vacations were tiring.

00:31:18.119 --> 00:31:24.059
We were both working to maintain our lifestyle.

00:31:24.059 --> 00:31:29.720
But our lifestyle was controlling us.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:49.619
We were spending money without even a thought.

00:31:49.619 --> 00:31:52.619
It seemed we were never satisfied with what we had.

00:31:52.619 --> 00:32:04.029
In one of Jesus' illustrations,

00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:07.029
a rich man built bigger storehouses

00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:09.029
so he could store all his things.

00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:24.160
But then God said to the rich man,

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.160
unreasonable one,

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.160
this night they are demanding your life from you.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:46.339
Who then is to have the things you stored up?

00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:48.339
His things could not save his life.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.970
We reflected on Ecclesiastes 2.22, which reads,

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.970
what does a man really gain from all his hard work

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:03.970
and ambition that drives him to work hard under the sun?

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:07.970
We meditated on what matters most.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:15.420
And we were determined to simplify our life.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.420
We had stored up many things.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.420
And it wasn't easy letting go.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:33.980
But the more we let go,

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:54.319
the more we felt free.

00:33:54.319 --> 00:33:56.319
We analyzed our expenses,

00:33:56.319 --> 00:34:10.670
and we made adjustments.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:26.219
We prayed to Jehovah before making any decisions.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:31.579
With time and effort,

00:34:31.579 --> 00:34:34.579
we came to have more joy and freedoms

00:34:34.579 --> 00:34:36.579
we didn't think possible.

00:34:36.579 --> 00:35:25.820
Simplifying your life can take time,

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.820
and it is not easy.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:33.820
But the reward Jehovah gives can far outweigh any sacrifice we make.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.820
With nothing to hold us back,

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.820
we were now in a position to accept any assignment Jehovah gave us.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:46.860
Now we could share our joy with others.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:53.570
We are truly happy.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.570
Our secret?

00:35:58.289 --> 00:36:00.289
We live a simple life.

00:36:00.289 --> 00:36:31.349
Did you notice the many things they simplified

00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:34.349
to reach their goal to serve what the need is great?

00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:38.349
They found real joy in putting their trust in God.

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:42.349
If you're considering ways to simplify your life

00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:44.349
to serve God more fully,

00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:46.349
take it to Jehovah in prayer

00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:48.349
and look for His guidance.

00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:51.349
For some, living a life dedicated to God

00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:54.349
meant giving up something they loved to do,

00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:57.349
but that demanded their full attention.

00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:59.349
We met a brother in South Africa

00:36:59.349 --> 00:37:03.349
who had to decide what would be his life's devotion.

00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:09.400
What factors led him to make the better choice?

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.400
My love soccer very much.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.400
It was one thing that gave me pleasure.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.400
Growing up in Newcastle,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.400
in the township of Osisway,

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.400
was quite a nice experience.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.400
As kids, young boys, playing soccer in the streets,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.400
bare feet,

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.400
using breaks as goal posts

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.400
and playing right up until after sunset.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.400
Even at school, playing at lunch breaks,

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:39.739
playing soccer was like culture for us.

00:37:39.739 --> 00:37:42.739
I couldn't see anything else better than soccer.

00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:45.739
I ended up representing the province

00:37:45.739 --> 00:37:48.739
and then played for the youth national teams,

00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:50.739
representing the country

00:37:50.739 --> 00:37:52.739
and then got chosen to play professional soccer

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:54.739
with one of the local clubs.

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:56.739
Then eventually, I went overseas

00:37:56.739 --> 00:38:00.739
to play in different tournaments in countries like Belgium,

00:38:00.739 --> 00:38:27.010
Netherlands, France and Germany.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.010
I'd find it that time enjoyed it, you know,

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:33.010
because it's something that you grow up hoping to achieve.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.010
And when it does happen, it makes you happy

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.010
and proud of yourself.

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:40.010
And of course, your families, proud,

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.010
your community,

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:46.380
everyone who worked hard in getting you there.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.380
While I was on holiday from soccer,

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.380
I went over to visit my brother

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.380
who was studying the Bible with the witnesses,

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.380
asked him about it.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.380
He explained to me, basically, preached to me.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.380
And he took me to my first meeting.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.380
I was amazed to see so much emphasis

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.380
in the Bible and looking at young kids,

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.380
knowing how to look up the scriptures.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.380
I didn't know the Bible,

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.380
although I had been going to church all my life

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.380
and seeing the love with the Kingdom Hall there,

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.380
just made me realize that there was something in this.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:25.269
And I had to look closely to see what it was.

00:39:25.269 --> 00:39:28.269
Deep personal study, Bible reading,

00:39:28.269 --> 00:39:31.269
and meditation helped me realize that,

00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:34.269
hey, Jehovah requires that I put him first

00:39:34.269 --> 00:39:37.269
and then professional soccer requires the same thing.

00:39:37.269 --> 00:39:39.269
Full dedication right now.

00:39:39.269 --> 00:39:42.269
I must say, deciding to quit professional soccer

00:39:42.269 --> 00:39:44.269
and serve Jehovah more fully

00:39:44.269 --> 00:39:46.269
was not an easy decision,

00:39:46.269 --> 00:39:48.269
because I knew what it would involve.

00:39:48.269 --> 00:39:52.269
Disappointing my whole family, relatives, friends,

00:39:52.269 --> 00:39:55.269
my whole community, the whole country,

00:39:55.269 --> 00:39:59.269
people who were very close to me, who really loved me.

00:39:59.269 --> 00:40:01.269
With professional sport of soccer,

00:40:01.269 --> 00:40:03.269
any career in this world,

00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:06.269
there are no guarantees, you know?

00:40:06.269 --> 00:40:08.269
And with Jehovah, everything is guaranteed,

00:40:08.269 --> 00:40:10.269
as long as we put him first.

00:40:10.269 --> 00:40:12.269
And I realized that I had to make a decision

00:40:12.269 --> 00:40:15.269
to quit professional soccer

00:40:15.269 --> 00:40:17.269
and put Jehovah to the test

00:40:17.269 --> 00:40:19.269
and taste and see that he is good.

00:40:19.269 --> 00:40:21.269
And of course, coming to Bethel

00:40:21.269 --> 00:40:23.269
was a special privilege,

00:40:23.269 --> 00:40:26.269
because here, you give Jehovah

00:40:26.269 --> 00:40:29.269
everything you have every day.

00:40:29.269 --> 00:40:31.269
And that's why I met my wife.

00:40:31.269 --> 00:40:33.269
Thanks to coming to full-time service,

00:40:33.269 --> 00:40:36.269
meeting someone who is very supportive to me,

00:40:36.269 --> 00:40:38.269
who loves Jehovah primarily,

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:40.269
who loves me,

00:40:40.269 --> 00:40:43.269
and having a teammate like that is so wonderful blessing.

00:40:43.269 --> 00:40:46.269
Working in the sign language field,

00:40:46.269 --> 00:40:49.269
is a special blessing also.

00:40:49.269 --> 00:40:53.269
Here, you're teaching deaf people the truth.

00:40:53.269 --> 00:40:55.269
It's a quiet world for them

00:40:55.269 --> 00:40:58.269
and here they see you as a hearing person

00:40:58.269 --> 00:41:02.269
and they can see you've worked hard to learn the language

00:41:02.269 --> 00:41:06.269
and you introduce them to Jehovah

00:41:06.269 --> 00:41:08.269
in a special way.

00:41:08.269 --> 00:41:10.269
You see them growing in the truth,

00:41:10.269 --> 00:41:12.269
being deaf,

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:14.269
understanding that Jehovah understands sign language,

00:41:14.269 --> 00:41:16.269
understands their language.

00:41:16.269 --> 00:41:18.269
You see them growing in appreciation,

00:41:18.269 --> 00:41:20.269
even in accepting that they're deaf,

00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:22.269
not because of Jehovah.

00:41:22.269 --> 00:41:24.269
And they understand why they're deaf

00:41:24.269 --> 00:41:27.269
and they come to understand why others have disabilities,

00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:30.269
and to see them being happy in their lives for a change,

00:41:30.269 --> 00:41:32.269
thanks to their truth.

00:41:32.269 --> 00:41:36.269
I'm grateful that I chose to play for Jehovah's team

00:41:36.269 --> 00:41:38.269
because in the world,

00:41:38.269 --> 00:41:40.269
the very same people that you play with

00:41:40.269 --> 00:41:42.269
in the same team, your teammates,

00:41:42.269 --> 00:41:45.269
you're competing all the time,

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:47.269
you're always competing to be chosen,

00:41:47.269 --> 00:41:49.269
you're fighting for positions,

00:41:49.269 --> 00:41:52.269
and you come this side in the organization.

00:41:52.269 --> 00:41:56.809
Being with fellow brothers and sisters,

00:41:56.809 --> 00:41:59.809
we don't compete for Jehovah's approval.

00:41:59.809 --> 00:42:02.809
Jehovah appreciates each and every one of us.

00:42:02.809 --> 00:42:09.420
Success in this world can look like security,

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.420
but brother and zizi realize only Jehovah

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.420
can secure our everlasting future.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.420
Instead of accepting a high-paying contract

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.420
and professional soccer,

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.420
he took the path that enabled him

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.420
to let his light shine in the ministry

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.420
and for 10 years in Bethel service.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.420
We go now from the South Africa branch

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.420
to the Indonesia branch

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:37.420
where we met with long-time missionary Reiner Tashman.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.420
He shares some of Indonesia's spiritual history

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.420
and takes us to a recent event

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.420
that strengthened the faith of all who attended.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:43:03.780
People often ask me,

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.780
what is Indonesia like?

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:12.780
Well, Indonesia is 250 million people.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:23.570
Diverse religions.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:32.449
Traditional villages.

00:43:32.449 --> 00:43:44.469
Huge modern cities.

00:43:44.469 --> 00:43:58.059
But when I first came to Indonesia,

00:43:58.059 --> 00:44:01.059
life was quite different.

00:44:01.059 --> 00:44:10.889
I arrived here as a missionary in 1968.

00:44:10.889 --> 00:44:14.889
And after spending about a year in the field,

00:44:14.889 --> 00:44:19.650
I was assigned to do traveling work.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:24.630
I traveled all over the country.

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:27.630
I had some real adventures.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:39.599
Later, I was called into the branch office.

00:44:39.599 --> 00:44:43.840
In 1976, though,

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.840
the Churches of Christenham succeeded

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.840
in having our preaching work banned.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:54.119
We moved the branch office to a secret location.

00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:57.119
We had many confidential files

00:44:57.119 --> 00:45:01.119
and I copied them on a tiny piece of paper

00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:04.119
and stored them in little match boxes.

00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:07.460
We kept on preaching, of course,

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.460
and held our meetings.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:14.159
We even held our assemblies.

00:45:14.159 --> 00:45:19.659
And finally, in 2001,

00:45:19.659 --> 00:45:22.659
the ban was lifted.

00:45:22.659 --> 00:45:29.130
For me, in Indonesia has been a preacher's paradise.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:35.329
People are friendly.

00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:38.329
It is easy to place literature.

00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:43.329
You can even start plenty of Bible studies.

00:45:43.329 --> 00:45:50.329
But recently, we had another thrilling spiritual development.

00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:54.329
For years, our branch office was hidden away.

00:45:54.329 --> 00:46:02.639
But it is not hidden anymore.

00:46:02.639 --> 00:46:05.639
Our new branch office occupies a floor

00:46:05.639 --> 00:46:09.639
in one of the most modern buildings in Jakarta.

00:46:09.639 --> 00:46:12.639
In February 2015,

00:46:12.639 --> 00:46:16.639
brothers and sisters from all over the world gathered in Jakarta

00:46:16.639 --> 00:46:20.639
to attend the dedication of the new branch facilities.

00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:33.760
Most of us hadn't seen each other for years.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.760
Hundreds of brothers and nearby locations

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.760
followed the program by a video link.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.760
Anthony Morris, from the governing body,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.760
delivered the dedication talk.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.760
I'm going to ask you this question.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.760
And then you just give a bold yes if you agree.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.760
All joining and dedicating this branch facility

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.760
to the worship of Jehovah God

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.760
are Grand King in the service of the Messianic King Jesus Christ.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:14.809
Say yes.

00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:17.809
The following day, thousands of brothers and sisters gathered

00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:20.809
at a special assembly in Jakarta.

00:47:20.809 --> 00:47:25.809
30 other locations around Indonesia were tied in via video link.

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:36.690
We've never had a convention like it.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:42.079
Indonesia is opening up,

00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:45.079
and the kingdom work is really moving ahead.

00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:52.739
And for that, I truly thank Jehovah.

00:47:52.739 --> 00:48:02.739
How thrilling it must have been for our brothers and Indonesia

00:48:02.739 --> 00:48:04.739
to go from preaching under a ban

00:48:04.739 --> 00:48:07.739
to now having their work organized openly

00:48:07.739 --> 00:48:10.739
from a beautiful new branch office.

00:48:10.739 --> 00:48:13.739
Special programs like a branch dedication

00:48:13.739 --> 00:48:17.739
are historic events and unforgettable experiences.

00:48:18.739 --> 00:48:22.739
While not all of us can attend every special meeting,

00:48:22.739 --> 00:48:25.739
more and more of these programs are shared with us

00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:27.739
on JW Broadcasting.

00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:29.739
In March of this year,

00:48:29.739 --> 00:48:32.739
our brothers and sisters in Brazil were thrilled

00:48:32.739 --> 00:48:37.739
when 1,130,826 of them gathered to receive

00:48:37.739 --> 00:48:42.150
a precious gift from Jehovah.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:45.150
In Brazil, with the governing body support,

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:48.150
planning began in 2007 to produce a revised version

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:52.150
of the New World Translation in Brazilian Portuguese.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:56.750
Using the English source text and many reference works,

00:48:56.750 --> 00:49:04.880
the Portuguese translation team refined the text.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.880
After seven years of intense and thorough work,

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.880
the new Bible was composed and finally ready for printing.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:19.170
The United States and Japan branches printed almost

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:30.630
1.3 million Bibles and shipped them to Brazil.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:36.309
Once they arrived at the branch,

00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:39.309
it took about three months to forward them

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:42.309
to the more than 11,000 congregations around Brazil,

00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:46.309
involving a lot of careful planning and organization.

00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:49.309
Each box was labeled with specific instructions

00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:53.940
that they should not be opened in advance.

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.940
The first boxes were sent to the furthest regions

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.940
so that every congregation would have them on hand

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.940
for a special meeting arranged for March 22nd, 2015.

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:23.110
Finally, that special day arrived.

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:27.969
Preparations were made so that all the congregations in Brazil

00:50:27.969 --> 00:50:28.969
would be connected.

00:50:28.969 --> 00:50:35.219
More than 740,000 attended the event at a live broadcast meeting

00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:40.219
and many others would watch later on during the day.

00:50:40.219 --> 00:50:43.219
In some kingdoms, there were up to three sessions.

00:50:43.219 --> 00:50:55.690
The audience enjoyed upbuilding talks and interviews with brothers

00:50:55.690 --> 00:51:02.349
that saw the first New World Translation release in 1967.

00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:04.349
There was great anticipation in the air.

00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:07.349
Brothers Plain was present for the special meeting

00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:11.349
and what a joy it was to discover that the Bible had been revised

00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:14.349
and was now available in Brazilian Portuguese.

00:51:40.679 --> 00:51:44.679
Everyone present received their own personal copy of the New Revised Bible.

00:51:44.679 --> 00:52:13.429
While the Bible was being distributed,

00:52:13.429 --> 00:52:18.429
those in attendance heard a chorus sing the new songs in Portuguese.

00:52:34.219 --> 00:52:37.219
This new Bible will help me to get to know Jehovah

00:52:37.219 --> 00:52:42.219
and it will be even better for the use in the field ministry.

00:52:42.219 --> 00:52:46.219
Our brothers and sisters present were so grateful for what they saw

00:52:46.219 --> 00:52:50.219
and heard at this unforgettable meeting.

00:52:50.219 --> 00:52:53.219
The illustrations here at the back are very interesting

00:52:53.219 --> 00:53:01.530
because it's much easier to understand.

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:04.530
How wonderful to know that at the end of that special day

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:10.530
with Jehovah's help around 1.1 million Bibles had been distributed.

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:22.340
Few things compared to receiving the New World Translation in your own language.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:28.340
As Jehovah's people, we love studying from a clear and accurate translation

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:32.340
since the Bible is God's way of communicating with us today.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:38.039
What though if someone suffers from a condition that makes it difficult

00:53:38.039 --> 00:53:42.039
to focus on Bible truth at meetings, family worship,

00:53:42.039 --> 00:53:44.039
our personal study?

00:53:44.039 --> 00:53:49.039
In some cases, we patiently wait for Jehovah's cure in the new system.

00:53:49.039 --> 00:53:53.039
But for others, like 10-year-old Jaden Schreiber,

00:53:53.039 --> 00:53:57.039
adjustments are possible that can help them to benefit from Bible study.

00:53:57.039 --> 00:54:19.230
When I wake up to a ministry day, I enjoy waking up to that day.

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:25.800
Because I look forward to it, I have fun doing the ministry with the friends.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:31.800
I love showing the Caleb videos to the little kids at the door.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.800
But it hasn't always been so easy.

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.800
I have autism.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.800
Loud noises were really, really hard for me,

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.800
like when the audience laughed or clapped.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.800
Or even crowds, like a lot of people,

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.800
you just can't be around them.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.800
Because you just feel like this is too much.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.800
Family worship was difficult when I was eight or nine.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.800
And I just didn't really want to do it.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.800
It was getting all my nerves.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.800
It was just not really easy.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:09.400
Some days it felt impossible to go to school.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.400
There was a day when I went outside

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.400
and I just like, I cannot go back in there.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:21.400
One time, a kid came out of nowhere and just pushed me over.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:27.400
It made me feel physical pain and emotional pain.

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.400
When other kids were playing without me,

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:34.400
it just made me feel a little upset that they're leaving me out.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.400
It just made me feel a bit lonely.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:42.400
At first, my parents did not know how to communicate with me.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.400
I had mental and social challenges.

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:50.400
The brothers and sisters could not understand what I was doing.

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.400
My parents found out I had autism.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.400
Then as the years passed,

00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.400
it got easier and easier for them to communicate with me.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:06.400
The friends in the congregation have helped me by doing whatever they need to do

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:11.400
to help me stay on the road to life.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:15.400
Some of the ways that my parents have helped me to learn about Jehovah

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.400
are household activities.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:23.400
Like making food, going out in nature and failing worship.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:28.400
My parents took a new route by situating spiritual things all day long

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:32.400
instead of one thing once or twice a week.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:41.139
And now, family worship cannot be better.

00:56:41.139 --> 00:56:46.139
Relationship with Jehovah has helped me overcome challenges.

00:56:46.139 --> 00:56:50.139
He is also a better friend to me than ever before.

00:56:50.139 --> 00:56:55.139
By family worship, Bible reading, personal Bible reading,

00:56:55.139 --> 00:56:59.139
and I do like the whiteboard animations.

00:56:59.139 --> 00:57:01.139
Beating a bully without using your fist,

00:57:01.139 --> 00:57:04.139
it's helped me to show how to deal with it.

00:57:04.139 --> 00:57:10.139
Actually, right then, I was starting to experience some bad things going on my school

00:57:10.139 --> 00:57:15.139
and when they started doing those whiteboard animations, it pretty much saved me.

00:57:15.139 --> 00:57:18.139
We just love him so much.

00:57:18.139 --> 00:57:21.139
He's just been such a bright spot.

00:57:21.139 --> 00:57:23.139
He loves giving pictures to people.

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:24.139
They're a little piece of him.

00:57:24.139 --> 00:57:28.139
Whether it's a picture of a really cool car or whatever he's drawn.

00:57:28.139 --> 00:57:30.139
He's handing you a piece of himself.

00:57:30.139 --> 00:57:33.139
Well, I can remember when I was his age.

00:57:33.139 --> 00:57:36.139
I would never be up in front of that many people.

00:57:36.139 --> 00:57:41.139
Jaden has dealt with that fear and he seems very comfortable with it now.

00:57:41.139 --> 00:57:44.139
He's not afraid to speak in front of the congregation.

00:57:44.139 --> 00:57:47.139
And the congregation is very supportive.

00:57:47.139 --> 00:57:51.139
I feel like I've been an important part of the congregation by publishing.

00:57:51.139 --> 00:57:54.139
When I took a personal interest of those I meet in the ministry,

00:57:54.139 --> 00:57:58.139
I started getting return visits and I started showing videos.

00:57:58.139 --> 00:58:03.139
In fact, we are studying the good news from God Roaster.

00:58:03.139 --> 00:58:07.139
Really, anytime Jaden answers, the congregation really pays attention.

00:58:07.139 --> 00:58:09.139
He speaks from his heart when he answers.

00:58:09.139 --> 00:58:11.139
And the brothers and sisters really appreciate that.

00:58:11.139 --> 00:58:14.139
It was really fun to take a trip to New York.

00:58:14.139 --> 00:58:16.139
Bethel was very fun.

00:58:16.139 --> 00:58:19.139
I got to meet some of the brothers and sisters.

00:58:19.139 --> 00:58:22.139
I also felt like it was part of something.

00:58:22.139 --> 00:58:26.139
When I was at Bethel, they helped me make a box.

00:58:26.139 --> 00:58:29.139
I don't know where that box went,

00:58:29.139 --> 00:58:32.139
but I knew I was helping somebody to come into the truth

00:58:32.139 --> 00:58:34.139
and become closer to Jehovah.

00:58:34.139 --> 00:58:38.139
We've really seen how Jehovah has greatly blessed Jaden

00:58:38.139 --> 00:58:40.139
because he has his own ministry.

00:58:40.139 --> 00:58:44.139
He's able to practice his social skills,

00:58:44.139 --> 00:58:48.139
both at the door and with the brothers and sisters that are out in service.

00:58:48.139 --> 00:58:52.139
And we really feel that Jehovah has created the perfect environment

00:58:52.139 --> 00:58:56.139
for Jaden to thrive spiritually.

00:58:56.139 --> 00:59:00.139
I can't believe that this is actually happening.

00:59:00.139 --> 00:59:04.139
That I'm actually born into Jehovah's organization.

00:59:04.139 --> 00:59:07.139
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:59:07.139 --> 00:59:13.849
Jaden has a form of autism spectrum disorder

00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:18.849
that still allows him to participate in spiritual activity.

00:59:18.849 --> 00:59:22.849
The loving help he receives from his family and congregation

00:59:22.849 --> 00:59:26.849
are a beautiful part of their fine works.

00:59:26.849 --> 00:59:30.849
It's our prayer that the variety of spiritual food now available

00:59:30.849 --> 00:59:35.849
will help others with challenging conditions to benefit from God's Word.

00:59:35.849 --> 00:59:38.849
Such variety includes our music videos.

00:59:38.849 --> 00:59:42.849
This month's video comes to us from our brothers in Peru.

00:59:42.849 --> 00:59:46.849
Missionaries first arrived there in 1946.

00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:51.849
And since then, the preaching work in Peru has grown dramatically.

00:59:51.849 --> 00:59:55.849
Still, there is a need for more workers in that harvest.

00:59:55.849 --> 00:59:58.849
In the music video, finding treasures,

00:59:58.849 --> 01:00:03.849
our brothers and sisters are using personal study to grow spiritually

01:00:03.849 --> 01:00:14.300
and set goals in their ministry.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.300
And my study,

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:25.900
there are treasures that I find I'm searching, digging deeper.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:35.750
When I take a little time to see,

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:41.750
it helps me understand just what the Bible means.

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:46.750
Imagination and meditation

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:53.900
these are the things that help me see inside

01:00:53.900 --> 01:01:01.309
to help me do a person.

01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:06.769
A person I should be.

01:01:06.769 --> 01:01:18.000
I can call more faithful, some more knowing example.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Gives me insight to God's feelings and his thought.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.099
Sometimes my mind and makes me realize

01:01:31.099 --> 01:01:37.659
how I can be more bizarre.

01:01:37.659 --> 01:01:42.250
Imagination.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:53.119
These are the things that help us do.

01:01:55.849 --> 01:02:19.119
As Proverbs chapter 2 tells us,

01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:24.119
we search for the knowledge of God as if we were searching for hidden treasures.

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:28.119
And there were excellent examples of that in our music video.

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:30.119
Yes, there were.

01:02:30.119 --> 01:02:35.119
Personal study and family worship not only help us reach our spiritual goals,

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:39.119
but as we saw, they give us what we need to make good decisions

01:02:39.119 --> 01:02:42.119
when faced with difficulties or temptations.

01:02:42.119 --> 01:02:48.119
And Bible study unveils the many ways we can let our light shine.

01:02:48.119 --> 01:02:54.119
Our program concludes this month with greetings from New Zealand.

01:02:54.119 --> 01:02:59.119
The Fenton Park congregation is located along beautiful Lake Rotorua.

01:02:59.119 --> 01:03:03.119
Visitors come from around the world to see native Mari villages

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:08.119
and geothermal hot springs like the Pohutu geyser.

01:03:08.119 --> 01:03:12.119
The 90 publishers in Fenton Park use their public witnessing cards

01:03:12.119 --> 01:03:15.119
in the local market every Saturday,

01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:20.119
taking the opportunity to witness to neighbors and the many tourists that pass by.

01:03:20.119 --> 01:03:26.119
The 10 regular pioneers are often joined by upwards of 40 auxiliary pioneers

01:03:26.119 --> 01:03:28.119
during special campaigns.

01:03:28.119 --> 01:03:33.119
The congregation includes brothers from India, Russia and Scotland

01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:38.119
as well as European New Zealanders and native Mari.

01:03:38.119 --> 01:03:40.119
They enjoy each other's hospitality,

01:03:40.119 --> 01:03:43.119
getting together regularly for cookouts,

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:47.119
their critic songs and Mari cultural music.

01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:53.119
Our love and greetings go to them and to all of you who are watching this program.

01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:57.119
From Brooklyn, New York, this is JW Broadcasting.
