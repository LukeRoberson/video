00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.009
How would you define a good teacher?

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.009
That's an interesting question, isn't it?

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:14.009
For many of us, perhaps we might answer by saying what we think a good speaker is like.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.010
We might say the brother uses many illustrations in his talk

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.010
or he was able to highlight a scripture that I've read many times,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.010
and yet for the first time I've seen something interesting in that that I've never seen before.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.009
Or perhaps we might say that he was able to keep my interest right through the 60 minutes.

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:42.009
Well, there are all sorts of different ways we could say that someone is a good teacher.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:48.009
Of course, the best compliment someone could receive is if they're told that they're teaching

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:55.009
a similar to that of Jesus Christ, because we know he said a wonderful example for all of us.

00:00:55.009 --> 00:01:00.009
But as we're thinking about the qualifications for someone to be a good teacher,

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.010
let's turn our attention to the words of the Apostle Paul.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.010
And if you turn with me please, to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verses 7 and 8.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.010
And here we see in addition to some of the matters that we just discussed,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.010
other aspects or other qualities that are required for someone really to be an effective teacher.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.010
So as 1 Thessalonians 2, 7 and 8.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:36.010
On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:45.010
So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of God,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.010
but also our very selves.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.010
You notice some of the qualities or attributes here that the Apostle Paul mentions

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.010
is being very important with regard to our teaching.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.010
In verse 8, it mentions tender affection.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:09.009
So love is very much connected with someone having the ability to be a good teacher.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.009
In fact, to reach the heart of the student, we have to display love as well, don't we?

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:20.009
Without reaching the heart of the student, if we're trying to teach,

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:24.009
it's like enjoying a meal in a dream.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.009
There really is no benefit at all.

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:34.009
So if we teach, but don't reach the heart of the student, then it really is a very little value to the student.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:43.009
Then looking on, notice it says Paul was determined to impart not just the message of the good news,

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.009
but his very self.

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:51.009
In other words, he put his whole heart into teaching others.

00:02:51.009 --> 00:03:01.009
Let's look up at verse 7, and I feel quite confident in saying that probably none of us would have listed this quality as being essential for a good teacher.

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.009
How does he start?

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.009
We became gentle in your midst.

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:13.009
Now, honestly, that probably isn't the first quality that would come to your mind with regard to a teacher.

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:17.009
But what's meant by this expression to be gentle?

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.009
Well, one Bible scholar made this comment.

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:32.009
He said this word that's translated gentle was frequently used by Greek writers as characterizing a nurse with trying children,

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.009
or a teacher with refractory scholars.

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.009
Now, I had to look up the word refractory and add it to my vocabulary.

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:50.009
It means basically difficult to control, resisting authority, unmanageable, unresponsive.

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.009
Well, do we see an interesting thought here?

00:03:54.009 --> 00:04:07.009
This gentleness has a firmness and stability about it that isn't rocked or shaken easily by the negative response of the one that's being taught.

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.009
Isn't that an interesting quality?

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:17.009
And no doubt, we've all tried to display that perhaps as we're trying to teach someone something about the scriptures

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:22.009
and we come across the thought that this person doesn't really accept it.

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:28.009
We state the fact, we show a scripture, but still they may have a problem.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.009
Well, how do we react?

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:38.009
You see, if we were to demand that they accept what we say because we said it, or because the scriptures said,

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:48.009
without reasoning with that person, then really we don't have that gentleness that the Apostle Paul is referring to here.

00:04:48.009 --> 00:05:00.009
So that's the ability under pressure to, in a lovingly way, in loving way, convince someone of something that perhaps they're not so responsive to.

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:06.009
Doesn't that open our minds to another aspect of what is involved with good teaching?

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:21.009
Now, by contrast, if we look back at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, we'll see that the Apostle Paul in verses 5 and 6 gives us a contrast about the type of things that we wouldn't want to do as a teacher.

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.009
Let's read that in verse 5 and 6.

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:35.009
In fact, you know that we never use flattering speech or put on any false front with greedy motives. God is witness.

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:46.009
Nor have we been seeking glory from men, either from you or from others, but we could be an expensive burden as apostles of Christ.

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:53.009
So what are these negative things that we certainly would want to avoid if we want to be an effective teacher?

00:05:53.009 --> 00:06:05.009
Well, notice that first one, flattering speech. Now, this reminds us of another scripture. Let's turn across to Proverbs chapter 28 and verse 23.

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.009
And this is a good reminder for all of us.

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:21.009
It says, whoever reproves a man, you know, or corrects his thinking, will afterward find more favor, favor than someone who flatters with his tongue.

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:36.009
Do we see the point that's being made there that flattery is not really an effective way for us to gain someone's confidence, but rather honestly correcting the thinking of someone else.

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:50.009
So with our Bible students or whatever level of teaching that we're doing, we need to remember the part of the process of teaching involves giving counsel or direction and correcting wrong viewpoints.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:07:02.009
For us not to do that in a loving way really shows that we don't love the person properly because we don't really want them to change their wrong thinking.

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:06.009
So avoiding flattering speech is very important.

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:22.009
Going back to first of us, this alone in chapter two, what's the second point that Paul mentions, a false front with greedy motives, so a false front pretending to be someone that you're not.

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:33.009
So none of us would ever want to put across a self-righteous viewpoint to try and convince others that we are holier than they are.

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:39.009
But as it says here, not to have that false front, and then mentions, it mentions greedy motives.

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:46.009
You see there is a marginal reference that takes us across to Acts chapter 20, verse 33.

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:53.009
There the apostle Paul says, I have desired no man's silver or gold or clothing.

00:07:53.009 --> 00:08:05.009
So certainly as a teacher of the good news, we wouldn't want to expect some benefits or something that we've come back to us by means of our teaching.

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:09.009
There the apostle Paul says a good standard for us.

00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:21.009
And then in verse six, he said he wasn't seeking the glory of men, or as one translation says insisting on our own dignity.

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:29.009
So it could be that if we're a teacher, we may feel that we deserve a certain measure of respect.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:33.009
Yes, our position is a little higher than the student.

00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:42.009
If we really feel that way deep inside, that's going to affect our attitude with regard to being gentle.

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:57.009
Not it because if someone questions what we say, or if it looks like they're not dignifying us in a proper manner, then we will lose that firm gentleness that helps correct the thinking of others.

00:08:57.009 --> 00:09:06.009
Well, when we think about all these various attributes and qualities that are needed for us to be a good teacher, perhaps we might feel that there's a lot we can work on.

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:14.009
I'm sure I feel that way as well. It's a continual battle isn't it for us to continue to try and be effective teachers.

00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:21.009
But one word of encouragement we gained from the book of Philippians as a final description.

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:25.009
Philippians chapter 2 and verse 13.

00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:34.009
For God is the one who for the sake of His good pleasure energizes you, giving you both notice the desire.

00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:43.009
Yes, so the desire for us to impart the truth in a loving manner to others and then also the power to act.

00:09:43.009 --> 00:10:00.009
So as we consider our teaching abilities, don't just think of techniques, but always remember, when we're a good teacher we need to be gentle in the midst of others and help them in a loving way to correct wrong thoughts.
