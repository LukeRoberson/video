00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:14.589
Now, a man named Zacchaeus was there.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.289
He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.449
He was trying to see who this Jesus was, but he could not see because of the crowd,

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.089
since he was short.

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:49.229
So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see him.

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:52.869
Zacchaeus, hurry and get down.

00:00:52.869 --> 00:01:04.799
For today I must stay in your house.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.120
With that, he hurried down and joyfully welcomed him as a guest.
