00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:09.859
In the mid-1960s, when I was pioneering, the political system was changing rapidly in the

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:17.190
country, making it difficult for brothers to maintain their neutral stand.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.789
Brothers were beaten, their bibles and literature burned for refusing to buy political

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.789
party cards.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.910
They burned down the brothers' homes and kingdom home in my area.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.750
I was stopped because of not having a political party card.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.549
They tied my hands and started beating me severely.

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:45.750
When they went to have supper, one stayed behind to guard me.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.590
He felt very sorry for me and said they will kill you when they retain.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.390
So he suggested that if I can be able to at least crawl, then he would untie me and allow

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.390
me to escape.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.430
It was dark outside and I dragged myself alone until I reached the brothers' home who

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.709
kindly assisted me.

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:14.310
Jehovah made a way out so that I could enjoy.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.849
An official announcement was made that the wake of the over-switnesses was banned.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:30.129
Our meetings were done at night from about 9 p.m. to about 1 a.m. in the morning.

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:38.370
And to avoid detection, we were not able to clap hands when things go well or sing songs

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.609
because for that we would be found.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:49.049
But to show appreciation, we just had to rub hands together.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.409
At my workplace, it became known that I was one of the over-switnesses and was arrested.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.569
I was taken to Chile prison and later transferred to Zomba prison where they kept condemned criminals.

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.769
I was kept in a cell next to the execution gallows.

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:10.729
I thought I was also going to be executed as well.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.370
Jehovah came to me and remembering Romans 8 to 8, I was convinced that even this would

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.449
not separate me from God's love.

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:28.569
When I was raised, I was so happy to be with my wife and the children.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.490
But because it was extremely dangerous to stay in Malawi at that time, we had to go to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.530
Mozambique in Malangani camp where we spent three years as refugees.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.449
We were permitted to have bibles, songbooks and other publications.

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:52.370
When we looked back at what happened at Malangani camp, we see that it was Jehovah helping

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.330
us to prepare for the things I ate.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.729
We had to memorize scriptures and also think those songs.

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:08.370
For the scriptures, for example, in 1974, the Eatex was taken at Hebacook 3, 1798.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.849
And the Eatex said that, for me, I would exot in Jehovah.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.490
I would be joyful in the God of my salvation.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.330
We didn't know how helpful this text would be in the future.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.449
Because of civil war in Mozambique, we were forced back to Malawi in 1935.

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.930
I was arrested and sent to the Reykjav prison.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.810
We had to work from morning to evening without food or rest.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.770
Cell blocks were overcrowded with most of us sleeping on the floor.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.409
The scriptures and songs that we had memorized were we were at Malangani refugee camp in Mozambique.

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.409
We are really very strengthening to us when we are in the Reykjav prison.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:03.129
And this, for the time when that Eatex that we received in Mozambique helped us.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:10.569
The brothers would say, have backook and then the other one would reply, 3, 1798.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.889
And then the others had to recite the Eatex, all these verses.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.209
With that, our faith was strengthened.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.529
Spiritual food was smogwooded into the country by Biasco Koreas,

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:29.329
who were traveling hundreds of kilometers.

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:35.649
The magazines were printed on Bible paper, which is much lighter than the regular paper

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:40.490
so that the Koreas could carry double the amount.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:49.290
We also were supplied with the mini magazines that could be folded and be put into a pocket.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.129
One day, we received the smogwood copy of the Eate book,

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.689
which used to also contain the daily text.

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:05.290
So what we did was that we copied all the text on the 20th tissues.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:13.449
And then we sent some of these to our sisters who were on the other prison blocks.

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.529
All these were wonderful provisions from the over.

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:23.370
That helped us quite a lot to be kept spiritually strong.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:33.139
In 2002, I was sent back to Zomber prison.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:44.019
But this time, not as a prisoner, but as a district overseer to care for a mini-sector assembly.

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:53.139
When I entered, my mind quickly went back to 33 years when I was in the same prison

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.259
next to the extrusion glass.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:03.699
Through the width that I read 54, this 17 came true,

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:10.620
which says, no weapon formed against you will have any success.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:18.660
As a family, riot in the eye, how injured government persecutions, refugee camps,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:26.259
prisons, beatings, like a food and shelter, with death of loved ones,

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:31.620
and at times thinking, we would die ourselves.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.779
Yet, we are never beyond the reach of George Lavignon.

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:45.220
Through all of these challenges, we were, and continue to be fully convinced

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.660
that nothing can separate us from God's love.
