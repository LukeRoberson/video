00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:11.570
I was serving at the Austria branch from about mid-70s to 1990.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.570
We had a small department that was assigned to help certain countries in Eastern Europe.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.570
And that included visiting the brothers on the ban, bringing them spiritual food,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.570
having secret meetings with them, and also the strengths of the local organization

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.570
that was exposed to persecution and ban.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.570
We would print books on Bible paper and miniature size.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.570
This way more books or literature could be taken to these countries.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.570
The couriers, they transported literature to these countries in their own private cars.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.570
This way hundreds of books could be transported.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.649
At the border, if a courier would be found transporting literature,

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.649
they would interrogate the driver.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.650
But these brothers were trained.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.650
They knew what to say to protect the work and not give away any secrets.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.650
Usually, after a day or two days, the officials would let them go back home to the home country.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.650
But not with their car. They had to have public transportation.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.650
Because the cars would be confiscated.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.650
But the brothers had the spirit of sacrifice. They were willing to waste that.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:40.650
But the majority got through, and actually every year, thousands of miniature books were transported secretly to Eastern Europe.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:49.650
So it was not just a matter of us being so clever in hiding things, getting it to the brothers.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.650
But we were always fully convinced and had evidence that it was Jehovah's Holy Spirit that helped us.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.650
Also, we transported stencils for a local production.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.650
So that in their countries, they could reproduce the same material with mimeographing machines.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:16.650
In most cases, the mimeographing machines were transported secretly by the couriers.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.650
The other method was to build it within the country.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.650
I remember there was a brother that was a very skilled engineer.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.650
And under his direction, they decided to build it themselves.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.650
So they were self-made, offset printing presses.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.650
The brothers had a number of underground printers that they had dug out under their own homes.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.650
In many cases, the brothers had to do what they did during the night.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:55.650
Because in communist countries, they had to go during the day to a factory or whatever else and do some secular work.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:10.650
But it testifies to the great spirit of sacrifice that the brothers showed to forfeit so much of their private life as a family to do at night the printing of the spiritual faulty.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.650
Some had only a few hours of sleep.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.650
But they loved Jehovah and the brothers so much that they did it.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.060
There was no kingdom hall.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.060
The brothers had secret meetings in private homes and they would not all come at the same time.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.060
Because if the neighbors would see certain persons all the time going to a specific house, there could be suspicions.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.060
And every week, they had the meetings in a different home of the brothers.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.060
And this helped to protect the work so that it could be kept secret.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.060
Singing was very important for the brothers.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.060
And they didn't have to have a song in hand.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.060
They knew the texts of the song by heart.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.060
And immediately, saying a number, they could sing the song.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.060
That affected the heart, the emotions of the brothers.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.060
So they were strengthened in their determination to be faithful.
