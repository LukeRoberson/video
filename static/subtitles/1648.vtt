00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:22.230
All over the world as Jehovah's people, we preach to all who will listen and we receive loving support from our congregations.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.230
But how is the global preaching work organized?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.230
How do congregations stay united around the world?

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.229
The service committee of the governing body oversees these tasks.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:44.229
Their responsibilities are to oversee the preaching work, oversee congregation organization,

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:50.609
and to oversee the Hospital liaison committee arrangement.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.609
First, consider how the service committee supports you in the preaching work.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:05.840
Coordinating the worldwide preaching work is an awesome privilege for the service committee.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.840
But we know that it was Jesus who gave the commission to go and make disciples of people of all the nations.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.840
And so we recognize that Jesus is the one in charge.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:30.840
A real effort is made to provide assistance so that our brothers and sisters wherever they are can effectively fulfill their personal ministry.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:50.840
For example, in recent years, we've seen the introduction of special metropolitan public witnessing, prison witnessing, harbor witnessing, reaching out to displaced individuals, for example, individuals in refugee camps.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:05.340
And depending on our schedule or our circumstances, opportunities to witness informally may present the best way that we can fulfill our personal ministry.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:15.340
Well, over 3,000 new disciples are being baptized every week, and the preaching work is being done in 239 lands around the globe.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.960
The service committee works under the direction of the governing body.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.960
We send significant matters to the governing body for direction.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.960
An example is the establishing of the teaching toolbox.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:40.960
The service committee gives very close attention to what publications would be considered as basic tools for the ministry.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.960
And because there's relatively few of those, all of us can become very well acquainted with them.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.500
And thus we're able to become very effective in the ministry in preaching the good news and in starting and conducting productive Bible studies.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.500
A number of you are moving to serve with a need is greater.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.500
Many of you are simplifying your life. And in some cases, a number of you are learning and adapting to new cultures.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Many thousands have entered into the Pioneer service.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:24.500
Now this opens up other avenues of service such as serving where the need is greater, observing on construction projects, and even entering into a special full-time service.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.500
A special full-time servant does not mean that they themselves are special.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.500
What is special is the assignment they receive.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.500
Those in special full-time service might be assigned to service a special pioneer, or as a field missionary, or in the circuit work.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:04:02.939
We need you young brothers and sisters to set spiritual goals, to go to SKE, for you young brothers to qualify to be ministerial servants and elders, and use sisters to want to be pioneers and missionaries, to drive the work ahead worldwide.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:09.939
Brothers and sisters, when we see your love for the preaching work, it is so heartwarming for us.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.939
No matter what your circumstances, you're doing your best to share the good news.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:33.870
First Corinthians chapter 14, verse 33, and verse 40, tells us that Jehovah wants things to be done orderly and by arrangement.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.870
The Scriptures confirm that the heavenly part of Jehovah's organization is well organized.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.870
The earthly part must be as well.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:54.149
Our motto is fast on principles and slow on rules.

00:04:54.149 --> 00:05:04.149
By holding to what is written in the Scriptures, we uphold Jehovah's thinking, knowing that we're imperfect, not infallible.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.560
As the Bible clearly says, we are not the masters over others' faith.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.660
Our brothers and sisters under much pressure these days.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.660
There's the spirit of the world, there's health problems, there's persecution, there's disasters.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:34.660
But the elders are there with the brothers and sisters, encouraging them and keeping the congregations clean.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:43.660
We love you dear elders and circuit overseers and respect you for the heavy load you carry.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:52.829
We have congregations in over 200 lands and in hundreds of languages.

00:05:52.829 --> 00:06:02.829
So providing spiritual food in the form of theocratic direction that meets the needs of the brothers and sisters worldwide is not an easy task.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:07.829
So we're in communication with the branch offices in over 80 lands.

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:16.829
Those brothers on the branch committees are like eyes and ears to the governing body and as a result we know what the needs are.

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:25.829
The service committee sends out theocratic direction by means of the service departments and all the branch offices.

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:38.829
As soon as the service departments get that information they begin translating it and then they ensure that it's distributed to some 7,000 circuit overseers and over 700,000 elders worldwide.

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:45.139
That means that that announcement or that information will then reach your congregation.

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:58.480
Like Jesus did with his disciples, we want to do everything we can to help you to carry out your personal ministry to the best of your abilities.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.480
And of course circumstances.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:14.759
When making headquarters visits or shepherding visits to the branches, I keep in mind that I'm visiting Jehovah's sheep and they have to be cared for and fed.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:20.759
It's very similar to the excitement that's generated when congregations have the visit of their circuit overseer.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:28.759
That same excitement is generated albeit on a larger scale when representatives come to the branches.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:41.759
It allows for that personal interaction where you can correspond with the branches, give them the encouragement they need, things that they may need assistance with but it has a tremendous unifying effect.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:49.759
We love you dear brothers for your self-sacrificing spirit and the hard work that you do.

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:55.759
We know that you're doing Jehovah's work and we know it's not always easy.

00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:03.759
Wherever we go in the world, we see the love that you brothers and sisters have for Jehovah and for the preaching work.

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:15.439
And when we see what you're willing to do for Jehovah, it warms our hearts and encourages us to keep going.

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:20.439
The work of the hospital liaison committees is something that is very precious.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:28.910
When we need help, Jehovah's organizations there to provide it.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:39.909
To help us become better acquainted with the hospital liaison committee arrangement, we should all take a look at the video, a loving provision for times of distress.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:47.909
There's nothing more frightening than learning that we have a serious disease or learning that a loved one has been in a serious accident.

00:08:47.909 --> 00:08:57.909
Jehovah has given us the HLC arrangement to provide the comfort, the encouragement, the strength that we need at those difficult times.

00:08:57.909 --> 00:09:04.190
We cherish our privilege to preach and worship together.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:11.190
In this divided world, our peace, love and unity are a modern day miracle.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:22.190
With Jehovah's blessing, we are confident that the preaching work will continue to advance and the congregations will be made firm in the faith.
