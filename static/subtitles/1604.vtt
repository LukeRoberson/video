00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:26.379
The Bible book of Daniel is filled with imagery, visions, amazing scenery and architecture.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:31.899
All of it serves to teach readers about the times we live in now and how we can faithfully

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.939
serve Jehovah.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:41.500
The team that made Daniel a lifetime of faith had to portray these amazing things on film.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.570
How did they do it?

00:00:45.570 --> 00:01:03.299
The early concept art was made to help in the development of the many visual effects scenes.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.500
The architecture and aesthetics of Babylon were quite different from what the Israelites

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.859
were used to.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:20.909
The sets needed to be designed in a way that helped convey what it was like being captured

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.150
and brought to a foreign land.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:34.590
The production design and sets and props departments built 360 degrees sets which made for an

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:47.620
immersive environment.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:02:09.370
Many costumes and props were carefully handmade for the production.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:15.699
Spearheads were hand forged.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:26.530
Most of the filming was done at Mount Ebo Studios in Brewster, New York.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:42.159
The additional scenes were filmed in nearby locations and in Florida.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:51.830
Several miniature sets were built including a cigarette and then actors were filmed in

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.719
front of a green screen and inserted into the final shots.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:06.000
As filming was completed, scenes were edited together and the visual effects team went

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.490
to work on many specialized shots.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:22.009
Digital models of people and animals were animated and combined with footage of real environments

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.849
to make scenes that would have been impossible to film otherwise.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:33.889
For example, a digital model was made of the immense image in King Nebuchadnezzar's dream.

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.650
The team researched the characteristics of the actual materials described in the scriptures

00:03:39.650 --> 00:04:03.189
such as metals and rocks so that when the image falls, it appears realistic and believable.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:13.509
Just look at the results of thousands of hours spent modeling, animating, simulating, rendering

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:49.040
and compositing music and sound effects at the final touches.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.339
What do you see, Jehovah asked the prophet Amos?

00:04:55.339 --> 00:05:02.139
What Amos saw taught him important lessons?

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:11.889
In the drama, Daniel, a lifetime of faith, what did you see?

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.730
And more importantly, what did you learn?
