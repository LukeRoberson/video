00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.210
For sure, Maltese people are a friendly people.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.710
It's in our tradition to be like that, but the Christian love,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.710
that Jehovah wants us to grow inside, that will triple the effect.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.710
In October 2015, the time finally arrived for the 650 publishers on the island of Malta,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.710
to host over 1,500 delegates for the imitate Jesus special convention.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.710
This would allow for a unique and unprecedented shout of praise to Jehovah.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.280
Well, the work in Malta was for a long time, rather restricted,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.280
and there was a lot of opposition.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.280
Now, with this special convention, the brothers make an impact on the people here.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.280
Some of them were not aware that we are a worldwide brotherhood.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.280
Maltese are very impressed with numbers.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.280
So now, when they see all these numbers and all this activity,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.280
they're going to change their whole mind about us,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.280
and it's going to open their hearts and minds to our message.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.659
As well as making a positive impact in the field,

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.659
the delegates got to visit the nearby Isle of Gozo

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.659
and have an interchange of encouragement with one of the territory's most isolated congregations.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.659
We are looking forward to this for over a year now,

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.659
and to have the reality, you see the brothers here.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.659
You can talk to them, you can hug them.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.659
You see the love, the sincerity,

00:01:45.659 --> 00:02:00.049
and that's what makes the difference.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.049
Hospitality was shown by Mies of the evening entertainment program,

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.049
which not only shared the local culture,

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:21.129
but glorified Jehovah and the many treasures found in his word.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.129
Children loved every bit of this thing.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.129
They even said, what are we going to do when this finishes?

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.129
We loved being with Jehovah's children.

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.129
It's so different than being with the children in school.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.020
In the convention, by means of the convention,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.020
I have felt closer to Jehovah,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.020
and I felt that I had Jehovah's spirit.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.020
I'm a plant, yes.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.020
I also met many other children from different congregations,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.020
and I really enjoyed that.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.030
The brotherly love continued,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.030
as other tours were hosted all across the beautiful island,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.030
allowing the visitors to see Malta,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.030
and the multi-speople to see the visitors.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.169
After we made it to safety,

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.169
we learned that the island was called Malta,

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:25.169
and the foreign-speaking people showed us extraordinary kindness.

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:30.169
They killed the fire and received all of us kindly.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:39.030
We extend the warm welcome to all those present.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.030
We would like to give a special welcome

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.030
to the 1550 delegates coming from Australia,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.030
Portugal, Spain, Greece, Israel, and the United States.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.340
I found the truth in 1960,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.939
and it was difficult at that time,

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.939
because there was no one in the truth.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.939
When I saw this crowd here,

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:25.980
I was filled with joy, seeing how Jehovah has made it grow.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.980
I was here in 1980 as a missionary.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.980
We only had 82 people here,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.980
and now look at it.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.980
From that little group, we are now huge,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.980
and that makes me very happy.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.980
It reminds us of the prophecy in the Hebrew scriptures,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.980
Malta despises the day of small beginnings.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.980
It doesn't matter whether there are many publishers

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.980
or a few, the fact is that Jehovah through his Holy Spirit

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.980
can do things that we are not even imagining,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.279
so that there will be an increase in kingdom proclaimers.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.279
The special conversation now over,

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.279
a lot of us take a deep breath and say,

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:12.279
it's done, but it's not time to stop.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.279
Now is the beginning.

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.279
The brothers, since they gave us a lot of encouragement,

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.279
and they came, they brought along their love as well,

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:25.279
and seeing all this makes you even want to give more.

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:28.279
Doing this for Jehovah, it's rewarding.

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.279
It is truly, the scriptures are right.
