Hello everyone, Haley from Genoa Design here, helping you to be effortlessly elegant.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.369
Follow us and thank everyone for subscribing to this channel.

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.969
So first up, I've got this gorgeous earring and necklace set.

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:29.579
Can you believe, Haley's business feed?

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:44.829
When you look this good, you feel great.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:01:12.890
Bad news.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.409
She's a sweetie.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.810
Reminds me I want to speak to her about a necklace.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.409
You too.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.609
You don't think she's showing off?

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:25.609
No.

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.409
Everyone thinks she's miswonderful.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.260
She's starting to agree.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.180
Is this just about Haley?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.590
Seems it's all about Haley.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.980
Your tea's getting cold.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
And you're changing the subject.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.180
No, but...

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.379
But you've brought this up before.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:58.000
What is it?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.599
Your friends, you pioneered together.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.799
Yeah, and that's why I'm concerned.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.400
Concern is good.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.599
But...

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.199
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:28.539
Concerned.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.340
Concern is good.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.139
But...

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:38.050
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.819
I thought you would understand.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.419
I think I understand your feelings.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.419
Not about Haley.

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.620
I haven't seen all her posts.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.099
There's nothing immoral is there.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.900
No.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.900
Good.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.300
That's not like her.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.500
Now, if it's the case of her being more careful,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.900
how she comes across, that's another matter.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.770
Why don't you talk to her?

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.969
Emily, you are a beautiful, spiritual sister.

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:34.909
You know, for years I had a bad habit comparing myself to others.

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:53.069
My own insecurity hurt me and my closest friends.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.069
So you don't think I should have spoken to Celia?

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.469
Oh, I'm glad you've asked Celia about it.

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.870
Tell me when you trust.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.469
What did she say?

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:07.669
She definitely understands how I feel.

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.759
Good.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.759
How about Haley's posts?

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:17.759
She hasn't seen everything she has out there.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.589
Hmm.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:26.189
She did say that Haley needs to be more careful

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:31.980
how she comes across.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.980
What did she suggest?

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.180
I should tell her that she needs to stop,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.589
but I'm too worked up.

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:53.699
Look, if Celia agrees that Haley's doing something she shouldn't,

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.699
you should talk to her.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:10.399
You'll find the right time.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:13.399
Thanks for understanding.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.000
I'm hungry.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.199
Can you say the prayer?

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.769
Sure.

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:32.850
Jehovah, we would like to praise you for your generosity and kindness.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.250
Especially as a pioneer.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.050
What kind of example is she setting?

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.250
Has Emily stopped following her?

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.850
No, not yet, but she probably will.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.649
Alistair, what do you think?

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:45.850
About what?

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.850
Haley's posts on a quick post.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.449
Is there a problem?

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.250
Emily's told me they're all just look at me.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.850
My clothes, my hair, my makeup,

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.449
and even Celia agrees with her.

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.449
Well, it's very easy to take things out of context

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.850
on social media.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.850
I know that I've done that

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.050
and realized later that I was wrong.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.300
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.699
Listen, I don't want to pull you away,

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.699
but if you have a minute, would you mind giving me a hand

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.100
with these boxes?

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:37.050
Sure.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.250
Thanks for your help.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.050
No problem.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.850
Jake, back in the hall, I know you were just expressing concern,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.649
but here's something to consider.

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:51.250
This principle is one of my favorites.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:59.250
It's found in Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 17.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.649
The first to state his case seems right

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:10.920
until the other party comes and cross-examines him

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.519
and try and understand.

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:19.920
It just means that sometimes we only hear one side of a story

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.720
and until we personally hear both,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.519
it's best not to draw any conclusions.

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:30.720
And even then, if it's something negative,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.519
we wouldn't want to spread it.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:40.019
Any more than we want something spread about ourselves.

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:41.819
I'm going to consider that.

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:44.680
Thanks.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.620
I'm going to apologise to Harry and Marie

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.329
and have Emily talk directly to Haley.

00:07:54.329 --> 00:08:09.259
Good idea.

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:10.060
Yes, Nana?

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.459
Don't forget eggs.

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:12.459
No, no, I didn't forget.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.660
Are you sure?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.660
No, I won't forget.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.459
OK.

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:17.060
OK, love you.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:34.480
I've caught you.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.879
Do you have a minute?

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:36.879
Hi, Emily.

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:38.879
Can we talk later?

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:40.679
I'm really struggling this morning.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.480
Do you know, it's just, you've been so busy

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.480
and I've been waiting for the right moment.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.879
I really just like to address it.

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:50.480
OK, what's up?

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.279
It's just that I've noticed you were post-lately on quick posts.

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.879
What about them?

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:58.879
Well, do you really think there's something

00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:01.679
that a pioneer should be posting?

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:03.879
Wait, what are you talking about?

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:06.679
Some people might think you're bragging.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.080
Some people?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.879
What people?

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:09.879
It's a business account.

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:10.879
I've got to show off my product.

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:11.879
I know, I get that.

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:12.480
It's just...

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480
I don't know.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.480
It could feel like you're drawing a little too much attention

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480
to yourself.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480
Who would think like that?

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.480
You?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.480
No.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.480
Not just me.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.480
Celia felt the same.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.220
You spoke to Celia about this.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.620
I didn't want to upset you.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.820
Jake said that I needed to take...

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:29.419
Set everyone.

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:31.019
I think it's my poster in a prove.

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:33.220
Not everyone, Haley.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.620
That's not what I'm saying at all.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.620
You are such...

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:47.899
Just trying to help you if you were just listen to me.

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:48.700
You're just...

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.899
Celia, listen to me.

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:53.500
Oh, yeah, listen to me.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.899
And I expected more from you.

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:58.100
Haley, what are you talking about?

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.700
Gossiping.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.700
About my posts.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.100
You're that lonely that you've got nothing better to do.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.049
Haley.
