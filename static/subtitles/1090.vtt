00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.179
There is an ongoing need for volunteers at Bethel and on theocratic construction projects.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.140
Are you interested in temporary or permanent service in these ways?

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.399
If so, we encourage you to watch the video Making Yourself Available for Bethel Service,

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:23.699
which can be found on JW.org.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.640
In addition, pioneers between the ages of 23 and 65 who are interested in expanding their

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.579
ministry are invited to contact their congregation secretary and fill in the online application

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.340
to attend this school for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.609
You may be seated.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:51.729
How can we maintain our joy in Jehovah's work despite pressure from the world around us?

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:57.090
Please follow along in your Bible as Brother Samuel heard of the governing body, introduces

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:11.650
and applies the dramatic Bible reading entitled Jehovah Cause Them To Rejoice.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.409
Served Jehovah with Rejoicing says Psalm 100 verse 2.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.090
Yes, Jehovah wants us to be joyful, and he's given us many reasons to rejoice.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.450
He gave us life with his many joys.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.849
He gave us the Bible to teach us how to enjoy life, and he guides us into countless joyful

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:35.849
experiences.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:40.609
Yes, Jehovah is the God who gives joy.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.769
Satan, however, does not want us to find joy in serving Jehovah.

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:47.450
Why not?

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.090
For one thing, he knows that joy helps us to keep on preaching and teaching the very work

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.730
he wants to stop, so he tries to destroy our joy.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.810
Sometimes, through official opposition, and at other times through family and community

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:13.650
pressure, Satan also wants us to cut back our service to Jehovah in order to obtain unnecessary

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.810
material things.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.289
He wants us to think that getting more and more material things will bring us lasting

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:22.289
joy.

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:23.849
He had won't.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.409
These tactics are not new.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:33.289
As we now read portions of the books of Ezra, Haggai, and Zachariah, look for lessons

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:39.689
that can help us to serve Jehovah with rejoicing today.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:47.169
Note what brought Jehovah's people joy back then and what robbed them of their joy, and

00:02:47.169 --> 00:03:04.879
consider why and how we can experience the joy of Jehovah today, even under trying circumstances.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:12.159
Ezra, a priest and a copious of the law of Moses, is the writer of the book that bears his name.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.560
The book of Ezra picks up the history of Israel from the end of Second Chronicles, which

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.719
you likely Ezra also wrote.

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:26.560
His 537 BCE, and many Jews are about to return to Judah.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.879
The nation has spent 70 years in captivity to Babylon for practicing idol worship.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:42.879
They've learned a hard lesson, and never again does the entire nation fall back into idolatry.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:50.840
Now, the time has come to get pure worship back on its feet in Jerusalem.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.439
The account spans the range of several Persian kings, starting with King Cyrus, and it has

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.080
a joyful beginning.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.080
Please open to Ezra chapter 1, verses 1 through 6, and follow along.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.919
In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in order that Jehovah's words spoken by Jeremiah

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:16.519
would be fulfilled, Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia to make a proclamation

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.160
throughout his kingdom, which he also put in writing, saying,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.920
This is what King Cyrus of Persia says.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.800
Jehovah, the God of the heavens has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has commissioned

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.399
me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:42.720
Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.000
to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.720
He is the true God, whose house was in Jerusalem.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.319
Anyone who is residing as a foreigner, wherever he may be, let him be helped by his neighbors,

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:06.120
by their giving him silver and gold, goods and livestock, along with the voluntary

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.759
offering for the house of the true God, which was in Jerusalem.

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:17.000
Then, the heads of the paternal houses of Judah, and of Benjamin, and the priests and the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.519
Levites, everyone who spirit the true God had stirred, prepared to go up and rebuild the

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:27.199
house of Jehovah, which was in Jerusalem.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:33.399
All those around them supported them by giving them utensils of silver and of gold, goods,

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:39.079
livestock and valuable things, besides all the voluntary offerings.

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:45.920
Just imagine, Jehovah returns the Jews to their land with a commission from King Cyrus

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.000
himself to rebuild the temple.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.839
Many Jews joyfully take up this assignment.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:58.839
However, those who for various reasons cannot give financial support to those who can,

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:07.600
likely in the early spring of 537 BCE, nearly 50,000 Israelites depart Babylon, leading

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.720
them are high priest Jesua, also called Jesua, and the governor whom Cyrus appointed

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.600
cerebral.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.839
In the early autumn, they arrive in Judah, and they are joyful.

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:26.079
But how can they sustain that joy?

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:30.160
Not what they do as soon as they get settled.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.240
Let's read Ezra chapter 3 verses 1 through 6.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.319
When the 7th month arrived, and the Israelites were in their cities, they gathered together

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:42.959
with one accord in Jerusalem.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:49.120
Jesua, the son of Jehazadak and his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shialtyel,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.600
and his brothers, rose up and built the altar of the God of Israel, so that they could offer

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.040
up burnt sacrifices on it.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.560
As it is written in the law of Moses, the man of the true God, so they set the altar

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.040
up on its former site, despite their fear of the peoples of the surrounding lands, and

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.199
they began offering up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah on it, the morning, and the evening

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.839
burnt sacrifices.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:20.759
Then, they held the festival of booths, according to what is written, and day by day they offered

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:26.160
up the specified number of burnt sacrifices that were required each day.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.639
Afterward, they offered up the regular burnt offering, and the offerings for the new moons,

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:37.240
and those for all the sanctified festival seasons of Jehovah, as well as those from everyone

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.040
who willingly offered a voluntary offering to Jehovah.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.959
From the first day of the 7th month, they started to offer up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah,

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:52.600
and knew the foundation of Jehovah's Temple had not yet been laid.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.160
Did you notice that the Jews re-institute Jehovah's worship, despite their fear of

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.680
the peoples of the surrounding lands?

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.319
Because of their courageous action, this is a very joyful time.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:13.319
It's just as Moses said when he instructed the nations to celebrate the festival of booths.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:17.519
You will become nothing but joyful.

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:23.000
The next year, they courageously and joyfully lay the foundation for the temple.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Let's read about that at Ezra, chapter 3, verses 10-13.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.159
When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, then the priests and

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:40.799
officials loathing with the trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asah, with the symbols,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:47.320
stood up to praise Jehovah, according to the direction of King David of Israel.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:54.000
And they began to sing in response by praising and giving thanks to Jehovah, for he is good,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.440
his loyal love toward Israel endures forever.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.840
Then all the people shouted with a loud shout of praise to Jehovah, because the foundation

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.080
of the house of Jehovah had been laid.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.679
Many of the priests, the Levites and the heads of the paternal houses, the old man who had

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:20.159
seen the former house, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:26.639
being laid, while many others shouted joyfully at the top of their voice, so the people could

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:31.759
not distinguish the sound of the joyful shouts from the sound of the weeping, for the people

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:38.639
were shouting so loudly that the sound was heard from a great distance.

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:45.120
Yes, some of the oldest members of the nation cannot imagine how this temple could possibly

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:52.440
match the glory of Solomon's temple, but the others joyful shouting over powers their

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.440
weeping.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.480
The people of the surrounding lands, however, do not rejoice.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.320
Instead they cunningly target Israel's joy.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:13.519
When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:19.000
to Jehovah the God of Israel, they immediately approached the rubble bell and the heads of the

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.240
paternal houses and said to them,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:29.759
Let us build along with you, for like you, we worship your God, and we have been sacrificing

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:34.840
to him since the days of King Ezer hadn't of Assyria who brought us here.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.919
However, the rubble bell and Joshua, and the rest of the heads of the paternal houses

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:42.279
of Israel, said to them,

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:47.360
You have no share with us in building a house to our God, for we alone will build it to

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.960
Jehovah the God of Israel, just as King Cyrus the King of Persia has commanded us.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:01.159
The rubble discerns that behind their enemies offered a help lurk bad motives.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:07.600
When he rejects their offer, they try to prevent the Jews from working on the temple.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.710
Notice how verses 4-7 continue.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:17.549
Then the people of the land were continually discouraging the people of Judah and disheartening

00:11:17.549 --> 00:11:19.149
them from building.

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:24.110
They hired advisors against them to frustrate their plans, all the days of King Cyrus of

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.950
Persia, until the reign of King Darius of Persia.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.669
At the beginning of the reign of a Hazooerus, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants

00:11:32.669 --> 00:11:34.990
of Judah and Jerusalem.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:41.470
And in the days of King Aras Xerxes of Persia, Bishlan, Mithredath, Tabiel, and the rest

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.149
of his colleagues, wrote to Aras Xerxes the King.

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:49.789
They translated the letter into Aramaic, writing it with Aramaic characters.

00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:57.549
Let's read what Riham, the chief government official and others of Israel's enemies,

00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:04.029
write to the King, consider what kind of false accusations they make, as recorded at

00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:07.789
Ezra 4 verses 11-16.

00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:10.350
This is a copy of the letter that they sent him.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:17.389
To King Aras Xerxes from your servants, the men of the region beyond the river,

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:24.669
and now let it be known to the King that the Jews who came up here from you to us

00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:26.350
have arrived at Jerusalem.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:32.509
They are rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city, and they are finishing the walls and

00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:39.070
repairing the foundations. Now let it be known to the King that if this city should be rebuilt,

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:44.590
and its walls finished, they will not give tax, tribute, or toll.

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:48.830
And it will result in a loss to the treasuries of the kings.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:56.350
Since we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not proper for us to see the kings' interests

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.909
harmed, we have therefore sent to make this known to the King,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.509
so that there may be an investigation of the book of records of your ancestors.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.990
You will find in the book of records and learn that this city is a rebellious city.

00:13:13.549 --> 00:13:19.629
Injurious to kings and provinces, and within it have been those stirring up

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:25.629
sedition from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:32.909
We are making known to the King that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished,

00:13:33.549 --> 00:13:37.309
you will have no control of the region beyond the river.

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:44.350
To those false accusations sound familiar? They are the same ones our enemies sometimes hurl

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:52.509
against us today. They don't pay taxes. They work against the government's inches. They're rebellious

00:13:52.509 --> 00:14:02.190
and seditious. They're uncontrollable. All false charges, of course. And back then they had their

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:10.350
effect. The King orders to work halted, and temple rebuilding comes to a standstill. How sad.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:17.549
When the Jews first returned, they didn't let fear of man stop them from doing Jehovah's work.

00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:24.669
But now they do. Many of us today face increasing opposition to Jehovah's work.

00:14:25.549 --> 00:14:32.269
But compromising our giving up has never brought any one joy just the opposite.

00:14:33.309 --> 00:14:38.269
Remaining faithful brings joy, even in the face of violent persecution.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.470
But how is that possible? Consider a true life example.

00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:51.230
Picture a mother and daughter surrounded by a mob of angry men demanding that they buy

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:58.190
political party cards. What would the sisters do? If they compromised and bought the cards,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:05.230
their persecutors would rejoice. But afterward the sisters would be miserable, knowing they had denied

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:12.590
their heavenly father. The sisters did not give in. Of course they didn't enjoy being ridiculed and

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:21.309
mistreated. Later, however, their consciences were clean, and they felt deep joy, knowing they

00:15:21.309 --> 00:15:29.789
had remained faithful to Jehovah. What about the Jews of Ezra's Day? Many may have left a stable

00:15:29.789 --> 00:15:38.429
life in Babylon to make the Argus trek to Judah. Now after about 14 years of constant opposition from

00:15:38.429 --> 00:15:45.309
the lane of the temple's foundation up to the ban, the Jews have lost their zeal for Jehovah's work.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:54.830
They go through the motions of offering sacrifices, but they're not doing what Jehovah told them to do,

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:01.629
finish rebuilding the temple. When they meet resistance, they rationalize that it must not

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:07.710
be Jehovah's time to finish the work. Apparently even the governor is irrebable and high-priest

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:16.029
Jesuah need encouragement. To provide it, Jehovah sends the prophet Haggai. Let's turn now to the

00:16:16.029 --> 00:16:22.750
book of Haggai chapter 1. Haggai's clear and powerful messages delivered during a period of

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:29.789
about four months get right to the heart of the matter as we read the Haggai chapter 1 verses 2

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:38.590
through 11. This is what Jehovah of Army says. These people say, the time is not yet come for the

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:44.269
house of Jehovah to be built. And the word of Jehovah again came through Haggai the prophet,

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:52.190
saying, Is it the time for you to dwell in your panelled houses while this house lies in ruins?

00:16:52.990 --> 00:17:00.750
Now this is what Jehovah of Army says. Set your heart on your ways. You have sown much seed,

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:08.430
but you harvest little. You eat, but it is not to satisfaction. You drink, but you do not drink your

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:16.829
fill. You put on clothing, but no one gets warm. The one who hires himself out puts his wages

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:25.390
in a bag full of holes. This is what Jehovah of Army says. Set your heart on your ways.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:33.549
Go up to the mountain and bring in lumber and build the house so that I may take pleasure in it

00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:41.630
and I may be glorified, Jehovah says. You were expecting much and receiving little. And when you

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:47.150
brought it into the house, I blew it away. For what reason declared Jehovah of Armies?

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:54.269
Because my house is in ruins while each of you runs around taking care of his own house.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:18:02.190
So the heavens above you withheld their due and the earth withheld its produce. And I kept calling for

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:10.029
a drought on the earth, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on what grows

00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:15.869
from the ground, on humans and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.

00:18:16.589 --> 00:18:22.029
Jehovah compares the results of the Jews' self-centered efforts to those of a hired worker who puts

00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:28.990
his wages into a moth eaten sack. Because the Jews are neglecting the house of Jehovah,

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:36.430
he holds back his blessing. The results of the Jews' labor are limited and their lives lack joy.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:45.309
Evidently, some try to feel that void by beautifying their own homes. But material things cannot

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:53.710
satisfy spiritual needs. Can we see the warning here for us? It's not wrong to enjoy nice things,

00:18:54.430 --> 00:19:02.910
but material things cannot bring us true and lasting joy, especially if we neglect Jehovah's work

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.710
to obtain them. Remember the lesson of Psalm 127, verse 1,

00:19:08.509 --> 00:19:15.869
unless Jehovah builds the house? It is in vain that his builders work hard on it. On the other hand,

00:19:15.869 --> 00:19:24.029
when we unselfishly seek first God's kingdom and his righteousness, he provides what we really need

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:31.710
and adjust the right time. As Proverbs chapter 10 verse 22 tells us,

00:19:32.349 --> 00:19:39.630
it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich, and he adds no pain with it.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:45.309
But now will this rebuild temple really not attain to its former glory, as some believe?

00:19:46.349 --> 00:19:52.990
So hey guys, Jehovah guarantees that the future glory of this house will be even greater.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.029
Let's continue reading the hey guy chapter 2 verses 3 through 9.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:06.109
Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now?

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:13.230
Does it not seem like nothing in comparison? But now be strong, Zerubba Bell,

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:20.269
declares Jehovah, and be strong Joshua, son of Jehazadak, the High Priest, and be strong all

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:28.269
you people of the land, declares Jehovah. And work, for I am with you, declares Jehovah of armies.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:35.950
Remember what I promised you when you came out of Egypt, and my spirit remains among you. Do not

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:44.509
be afraid. For this is what Jehovah of Army says, yet once more in a little while, and I will shake

00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:50.910
the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land, and I will shake all the nations,

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:58.190
and the precious things of all the nations will come in, and I will fill this house with glory,

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:04.990
says Jehovah of armies. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares Jehovah of armies.

00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:11.230
The future glory of this house will be greater than the former, says Jehovah of armies.

00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:19.309
Yes, when the Creator and owner of the entire universe declares his purpose, who are what could

00:21:19.309 --> 00:21:28.109
possibly prevent him from carrying it out? Nothing and no one. Jehovah's straightforward message is

00:21:28.109 --> 00:21:36.190
unmistakable. Still, the return ease need more encouragement. Jehovah sends his angel to another

00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:44.829
prophet, Zachariah. Please turn to Zachariah chapter 1 verses 12 through 16, and let's read together

00:21:44.829 --> 00:21:52.190
the angel's reassuring words for Israel. That is Zachariah 1 12 through 16.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:22:02.990
So the angel of Jehovah said, oh Jehovah of armies, how long will you withhold your mercy from

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:08.109
Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, with whom you have been indignant these 70 years?

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:13.950
Jehovah answered the angel who was speaking with me, with kind and comforting words.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:21.950
Then, the angel who was speaking with me told me, call out, this is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:29.230
I am zealous for Jerusalem, and for Zion with a great zeal. With great indignation, I am

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:35.789
indignant with the nations that are at ease, because I felt indignant to a small extent, but they

00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:43.710
added to the calamity. Therefore, this is what Jehovah said, I will return to Jerusalem with mercy,

00:22:44.349 --> 00:22:51.069
and my own house will be built in her, declares Jehovah of armies, and a measuring line will be

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:58.670
stretched out over Jerusalem. To emphasize just how protective Jehovah will be, the angel continues

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:07.950
at chapter 2 verses 7-9. Come, Zion, make your escape. You who are dwelling with the daughter of

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:15.150
Babylon? For this is what Jehovah of armies says, who after being glorified has sent me to the nations

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:24.109
that were plundering you. Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye. For now, I will wave my

00:23:24.109 --> 00:23:30.509
hand against them, and they will become plunder for their own slaves, and you will certainly know that

00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:39.869
Jehovah of armies has sent me. Would you let someone poke his finger in your eye? Of course not. Neither

00:23:39.869 --> 00:23:47.789
will Jehovah allow Israel's opposers to harm them. Then, in Zechariah chapter 3 verses 1 and 2,

00:23:47.869 --> 00:23:51.710
the angel reveals the greater enemy behind the opposition.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:57.630
And he showed me Joshua the High Priest standing before the angel of Jehovah,

00:23:58.269 --> 00:24:04.589
and Satan was standing at his right hand to resist him. Then the angel of Jehovah said to Satan,

00:24:04.829 --> 00:24:26.670
Is all this intended simply to build up Israel's confidence in themselves? On the contrary,

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:33.950
they need to remember that only with Jehovah's help can they accomplish anything.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:40.430
Listen to the angel's further words to Zechariah in chapter 4 verses 6 through 7.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:48.430
This is the word of Jehovah to the rebel. Not by a military force, nor by power,

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:57.150
but by my spirit says Jehovah of armies. Who are you, O great mountain? Before the rebel, you will

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:06.029
become a level land, and he will bring out the top stone amid shots of how wonderful, how wonderful.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:13.869
Energized by Jehovah's motivating words to his two prophets, the Jews stop wavering in a lack of

00:25:13.869 --> 00:25:19.869
faith and resume construction of the temple. Predictably, Israel's enemy and neighbors,

00:25:19.869 --> 00:25:27.630
led by Tatanai and Sheth Arbazinai also spring into action. Returning to the book of Ezra,

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:35.150
we read at chapter 5 verses 3 through 5. At that time, Tatanai, the governor of the region

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:39.950
beyond the river, and sheath Arbazinai, and their colleagues came to them and asked them,

00:25:40.509 --> 00:25:47.309
who issued an order to you to build this house and to finish this structure? Then they asked them,

00:25:48.109 --> 00:25:53.789
what are the names of the men who are working on this building? But God was watching over the elders

00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:59.309
of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report could be sent to Darius, and an official

00:25:59.309 --> 00:26:05.789
document could be sent back concerning this. So there's another lesson for us today, when we

00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:13.950
courageously do Jehovah's work despite opposition. Jehovah blesses our efforts and enables us to keep

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:20.829
on serving in. For now though, the Jews must continue their work on the temple under ban.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:27.150
The king who issued the ban, however, was assassinated after raining only seven months.

00:26:27.869 --> 00:26:34.589
So Tatanai and his accomplices are dealing with a new king, Darius I.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:41.069
In denouncing the Jews, they try to use the rubbables onwards against him,

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.829
including his statement that King Cyrus issued the order to rebuild the temple.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:54.990
They ask King Darius to investigate whether that's really so. Darius orders the investigation.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:02.509
What will King Darius decide? Will the Jews renewed faith and determination bring them joy

00:27:02.509 --> 00:27:09.630
or just more trouble? Darius learns that Cyrus did indeed order that the temple be rebuilt.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:14.430
At Ezra chapter 6, verses 6-12, we read,

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:22.990
derives stinging reply. So now, Tatanai, the governor of the region beyond the river,

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:28.190
sheath our Bosnianai and your colleagues, the lesser governors of the region beyond the river.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:35.470
Stay away from there. Do not interfere with the work on that house of God. The governor of the Jews

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:40.029
and the elders of the Jews will rebuild that house of God in its former place.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:46.349
Furthermore, I am issuing an order as to what you are to do for these elders of the Jews

00:27:46.349 --> 00:27:52.109
for rebuilding that house of God. From the royal treasury, from the tax collected in the

00:27:52.109 --> 00:27:58.109
region beyond the river, the expenses are to be promptly given to these men to continue without

00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:04.750
interruption. And whatever is needed, young bulls as well as rams and lambs for the burnt

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:13.390
offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, just as the priests or in Jerusalem say,

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:20.990
is to be given them continually, day by day without fail, so that they may continually present

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:26.990
offerings that please the God of the heavens and pray for the life of the king and his sons.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:35.390
I have also issued an order that if anyone violates this decree, a timber will be pulled out of his

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:41.789
house, and he will be lifted up and fastened to it, and his house will be turned into a public

00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:48.670
latrine for this offense. And may the God who has caused his name to reside there overthrow any

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:55.309
king and people who lift a hand to violate this order and destroy that house of God, which is in

00:28:55.309 --> 00:29:05.630
Jerusalem. I, Darius, issue this order. Let it be done promptly. Upon receiving the king's command,

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:11.710
Tata Nain and his colleagues have no choice. Not only must they stop interfering with the work on

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:22.190
the temple, they must help finance it. What a joyful outcome for the faithful Jews. In 515 BCE,

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:29.549
they hold the inauguration of the house of God with joy, and as we read it, verse 22,

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:36.430
they also joyfully held the festival of unleavened bread for seven days, for Jehovah

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:42.029
caused them to rejoice, and he had made the heart of the king of Assyria favorable toward them,

00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:47.150
so that he supported them in the work of the house of the true God, the God of Israel.

00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:56.410
Today, when wise and just officials similarly intervene in our behalf, we're very grateful to them,

00:29:57.289 --> 00:30:04.009
but we're most grateful to Jehovah for directing matters. As Proverbs 21, verse 1 says,

00:30:04.569 --> 00:30:11.690
a king's heart is like streams of water in Jehovah's hand. He directs it wherever he pleases,

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:18.170
so we do not put our ultimate hope in any ruler, our institution of this world.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:25.450
None of them can bring us permanent salvation. In fact, before the end of Satan's system,

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:32.650
all the nations will turn against Jehovah's people, but they'll experience an outcome worse

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:40.650
than that they've tantinized. What lessons can we draw from these portions of Ezra Haggai and

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:47.210
Zachariah? First, Jehovah blesses our determined efforts to keep on doing his work,

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:54.410
despite challenges, but he frustrates the efforts of our composers. Second, when we put Jehovah's

00:30:54.410 --> 00:31:02.730
work ahead of material comforts, he gives us true joy. What's the work Jesus commissioned us to do today?

00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:12.250
He made it very clear in his parting words to his followers. Go, therefore, and make disciples

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:19.930
of people of all the nations. Are we with our hearts and hands putting this assignment ahead

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:28.650
of material goals? Haggai, for told that one day, Jehovah's Temple would become far more glorious

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:38.410
than the one Solomon built. That prophecy is being fulfilled today. Jehovah is using our preaching

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:45.769
to shake the nations, millions of precious things. New worshipers are coming to him.

00:31:46.809 --> 00:31:53.690
These are joyfully flocking to the great spiritual temple, Jehovah's arrangement for worshiping him

00:31:53.690 --> 00:32:03.130
on the basis of Jesus' ransom sacrifice. Now is not the time to focus our attention on paneled

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:13.529
houses or on any other unnecessary pursuit. Very soon, on a day we do not expect Satan's world

00:32:13.529 --> 00:32:21.930
will end, and we will enter Jehovah's New World. So no matter how Satan tries to discourage

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:28.970
our distractus now, may we never let him rob us of our joy in Jehovah.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:35.529
May we rather walk with Jehovah right into his peaceful New World,

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:45.130
where we will serve him forever with rejoicing. Zehruppable, Joshua, Haggai, and Zachariah

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:54.089
have done much to help Israel regain Jehovah's favor. Later, in 468 BCE, Ezra himself

00:32:54.250 --> 00:33:00.329
comes to Jerusalem to support true worship, but the nation needs still more direction.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:09.130
So Jehovah sends them another brave leader. During the next two days of this convention,

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:14.250
we'll learn about that faithful and powerful man, Nehemiah.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:26.380
The Bible account of Ezra and the messages of the prophets Haggai and Zachariah assure us that

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:31.259
nothing can prevent Jehovah from blessing our work and causing us to rejoice.

00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:37.259
You'll be pleased to know that the dramatic Bible reading that you just enjoyed

00:33:37.259 --> 00:33:48.910
is available for download today from JW.org and in the JW Library app. We worship a god of saving acts.

00:33:50.589 --> 00:33:57.150
What does this mean for us as a group and for you personally? What can we look forward to in the

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:03.549
future? Please pay close attention to Brother Mark Sanderson of the governing body. As he answers

00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:19.070
these questions in the talk, rejoice and Jehovah's acts of salvation. Around the world, people

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:25.949
everywhere are looking for a Savior. They long for a Savior who can rescue them from disease,

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:34.670
from hunger, from poverty, from crime, from war, even from death. Well, in the midst of so many

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:44.670
calamities and so many problems, why are Jehovah's people rejoicing? Because our magnificent,

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:53.710
our Almighty God, Jehovah, is that Savior. We have Him. And as a result, we feel joy in our hearts.

00:34:54.349 --> 00:35:01.869
The Scriptures describe Jehovah as being a grand Savior. We know it is a part of His personality,

00:35:01.869 --> 00:35:11.230
His identity, to want to rescue and save His faithful servants. Well, knowing that Jehovah wants

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:17.710
to save us, how should it make us feel? Let's open our Bibles and look at this thought in the book of

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:29.920
Psalms, Psalm 9 and verse 14. It says, so that I may declare your praiseworthy deeds in the gates of

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:39.519
the daughter of Zion and rejoice in your acts of salvation. So now, how should we feel about

00:35:39.519 --> 00:35:46.079
Jehovah's ability to save us, about His acts of salvation? Well, the Psalmist said, we want to

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:54.159
rejoice in Jehovah's ability to save. And really, brothers, when we have a faith, a confidence

00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:02.800
that Jehovah wants to save us, that He has the ability to save us, and that He has ways and

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:13.840
means to save us, this truly is a reason for us to rejoice. If we have that faith, if we have that

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:21.039
confidence, we are going to be able to face the future with real confidence, knowing that whatever

00:36:21.039 --> 00:36:31.199
trial may come our way, we have our Savior. But now, brothers, to reassure us, to strengthen our

00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:37.599
confidence that Jehovah really is our Savior, it helps us to look to the past, to Bible times,

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:46.400
to see how Jehovah rescued and saved his people both as a nation, but also as individuals.

00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:53.760
Now, let's look rapidly at three different examples from the Scriptures where Jehovah saved his

00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:01.199
people as a nation. Now, here's the first one. It's from Exodus chapter 14. Now, you'll remember here

00:37:01.199 --> 00:37:05.840
that the nation of Israel was right there at the Red Sea with Pharaoh's armies all around.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:14.000
Well, it looked hopeless, but what did Jehovah do? He opened up that Red Sea right in front of his

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.559
people and allowed them to walk through on dry land. What a salvation that was. And then,

00:37:22.559 --> 00:37:28.079
what about in the time of Jehoshaphat and the nation of Judah? Do you remember when all those

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:35.280
armies of the opposing nations came and surrounded them again? Well, now, Jehoshaphat in 2nd Chronicles

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.800
chapter 20, he looked to Jehovah and he said, Jehovah, we just, we don't know what to do, but our

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:50.559
eyes are toward you. Well, what did Jehovah do? He said, take your position, stand still, and see the

00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:55.440
salvation of Jehovah. Well, that's what they did. They went out, they took their position,

00:37:56.159 --> 00:38:01.360
and without them having to fight it all, Jehovah threw those other armies into confusion,

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:08.079
and they all wiped each other out without the nation of Judah having to do a thing. Jehovah saved

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:15.599
his people. And as a third example, what about Hezekiah? Now, we've had this amazing Bible drama

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:22.000
several years ago at our regional convention where we saw Hezekiah look to Jehovah for for his

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:29.280
salvation and what happened? Well, Jehovah sent one angel, wiped out 185,000 men in one night.

00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:37.280
Well, now, what's the point, brothers? It's obvious from our review of the Scriptures that Jehovah

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:44.559
is a savior of his people as a group, as a nation. We've seen it over and over again in the

00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:53.440
Scriptures. But what about as individuals? Well, now, here's a nice example of what the Bible says

00:38:53.519 --> 00:38:59.840
here in Psalm 34. Let's read it first before we look at the example. It's Psalm 34 and verse 18,

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:13.659
Psalm 34, verse 18, it says, Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted. He saves those who are crushed

00:39:13.659 --> 00:39:19.420
in spirit. Many are the hardships of the righteous one, but what does it say here? Notice, brothers?

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:29.659
But Jehovah rescues him from them all. So what is it? What's the point? See, Jehovah rescues the righteous

00:39:29.659 --> 00:39:37.980
one, not just the righteous nation, but the righteous one. Now, here's our example. Think about the

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:46.219
faithful woman Hannah. Now, you remember her situation. Hannah was barren. She was constantly being

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:54.619
harassed and tormented by her husband's other wife, Penina. And so she went to the temple and she

00:39:54.619 --> 00:40:00.219
poured out her heart to Jehovah. Will you look at this with me? Let's go to first Samuel, chapter 1,

00:40:02.519 --> 00:40:16.619
first Samuel, chapter 1. And you see here, you see here that in verse 10, it says that Hannah was

00:40:16.699 --> 00:40:23.420
extremely bitter. And she began to pray to Jehovah and to weep uncontrollably.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:31.260
Well, this faithful servant of God just poured out her heart, begged Jehovah for his help, but

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:37.019
she had a very specific request. You see, verse 11, she asked Jehovah for a child, a male child,

00:40:37.579 --> 00:40:42.380
and she told Jehovah, if she would get this child, she would dedicate him to the service of God.

00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:47.340
Well, what happened? You see, look down here at verse 18.

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:54.380
Once Hannah had expressed this prayer to Jehovah, in effect, she just had thrown her burden onto him.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:41:01.980
Look at what verse 18 says. Her face was no longer downcast. Well, do you remember at the

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:07.260
beginning, she was extremely bitter. Now it says, her face was no longer downcast. What does it mean?

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:14.619
Well, Jehovah was already giving her the strength to be able to endure her situation,

00:41:14.619 --> 00:41:20.940
but it didn't end there because now look at verse 20. Within a year, it says, Hannah became pregnant.

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:29.820
So Jehovah gave her the request of her heart. Well, can you imagine how Hannah must have felt?

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:37.019
If you look over at chapter 2 in verse 1, look what she says. My heart rejoices in Jehovah.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:44.619
My horn is exalted by Jehovah. My mouth is opened wide against my enemies for I rejoice

00:41:45.579 --> 00:41:54.460
in your acts of salvation. Well, now obviously, Hannah rejoiced that Jehovah had become her

00:41:54.460 --> 00:42:00.699
savior and that she had experienced his acts of salvation. What's the point, brothers?

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:08.139
What's the point? Well, as individuals, we can pray to Jehovah with our specific distresses,

00:42:08.139 --> 00:42:14.699
with our specific requests and concerns. We know that Jehovah honors those who honor him,

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:22.460
and we know all of us have experienced when we feel that Jehovah has heard our prayer,

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:27.980
and he is in some way acted in our behalf. But now let's look at another example.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:35.340
Here it's Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Now you remember those three faithful Hebrews were there,

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:41.420
and the King Nebuchadnezzar had erected this golden image, and he said everyone had to bow down to it,

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:49.179
or they would be thrown into the fiery furnace. Well, what did Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego do?

00:42:49.179 --> 00:42:57.099
They absolutely refused to obey that order. They had to listen to Jehovah. Well,

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:03.659
those men were tied up, just as Nebuchadnezzar had warned. They were tied up, and they were thrown

00:43:03.659 --> 00:43:09.260
into that fiery furnace. But now, dear brothers, I want you to think about this. How do you imagine

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:14.699
this scene in your mind? Do you think that as they were going into the fiery furnace, they were

00:43:14.699 --> 00:43:20.380
all in a panic, and they were regretting their decision? Oh, I'm so sorry that I didn't bow down

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:30.969
to the image. Absolutely not. Just look at what these men said. Look at Daniel, chapter 3, Daniel,

00:43:30.969 --> 00:43:39.820
chapter 3. Let's look at verse 16 here. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the King.

00:43:40.699 --> 00:43:48.059
Oh, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If it must be, our God whom we serve

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:55.900
is able to rescue us from the burning fiery furnace, and to rescue us from your hand. But even if he

00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:03.820
does not, let it be known to you, O King, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:12.619
gold that you have set up. Well, now, when you hear those words, is there any regret there?

00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:17.739
Is there any weakness? Is there any panic? No. Even though they were facing death,

00:44:19.179 --> 00:44:26.940
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego faced it with courage. They faced it with resolve. They faced it

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:35.340
with dignity. Well, how they must have rejoiced when, after being rescued, even Nebuchadnezzar himself

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:41.900
had to praise Jehovah for the way he had rescued his servants. One of our brothers, what's the point

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:51.019
of this review? Obviously, in Bible times, Jehovah God has saved his people both as a nation and as

00:44:51.019 --> 00:44:58.699
individuals. And we know that Jehovah delights to do this and that it is a cause for rejoicing

00:44:58.699 --> 00:45:05.099
when Jehovah's servants experience his salvation. But now, here's the question.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:13.019
We know Jehovah delights to rescue us, to save us. We know he's moved to do so by his loyal love.

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:20.780
But what does it really mean? Does it mean today that when any sort of trial comes our way,

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:26.940
that Jehovah is just going to rush in, he's just going to intervene and rescue us every time?

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:34.699
No, it does not. It does not mean that. Now, why? If Jehovah loves us and he has the power,

00:45:34.699 --> 00:45:41.179
why is it that he isn't rescuing us from every situation? Well, do you remember what Satan

00:45:41.179 --> 00:45:49.579
said to Jehovah about Job in Job chapter 1? See, Satan said, you've put a hedge around Job. You've

00:45:49.579 --> 00:45:53.980
blessed everything he does. You haven't allowed any calamity to come to him. The only reason he

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:59.579
serves you is just because of selfish reasons. He doesn't really love you. He just worships you for

00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:06.059
what he can get from you. You see, that same charge could be made about any of us. If Jehovah

00:46:06.059 --> 00:46:13.500
just rescued us from everything, so what will Jehovah do? Well, when we're facing trials,

00:46:14.059 --> 00:46:21.019
it's true, in some circumstances, Jehovah may remove the trial. But in many other situations,

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:28.460
Jehovah may strengthen us so that we'll be able to review the trial. Excuse me, endure the trial.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:36.380
Either way, when we feel, when we experience that Jehovah is acting on our behalf, how does it

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:45.179
make us feel? We truly, truly rejoice. You know, brothers, this is not theory. This very week,

00:46:46.059 --> 00:46:52.860
I lost my own father in death. My father was 90 years old. He had served Jehovah faithfully

00:46:52.860 --> 00:47:01.099
for 63 years. Now, brothers, this is a trial that every single one of us experience as God's

00:47:01.099 --> 00:47:07.980
people. But some of you like me, we've experienced the death of a loved one during this coronavirus

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:16.860
pandemic. I'll tell you, it's not an easy situation. But what can we say? Well, I can say myself,

00:47:17.579 --> 00:47:24.940
we have felt the love of Jehovah in all of the emails, in all of the phone calls, in all the

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:30.139
different ways brothers and sisters have found to provide the support that we need. That's been

00:47:30.139 --> 00:47:36.300
true, in my case, I know it's been true for all of you who've had the same or very similar

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:43.179
experience at this difficult time. Jehovah is giving us what we need so that we can continue on

00:47:43.179 --> 00:47:53.099
to serve him faithfully. And so when some big trial comes your way, ask yourself, am I confident

00:47:53.099 --> 00:48:01.179
that Jehovah's loyal love is going to move him to act on my behalf? Are his acts of salvation

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:09.659
going to be manifest for me so that I am going to feel them myself? And then does that confidence

00:48:09.659 --> 00:48:16.300
that Jehovah is going to intervene, that he is going to help us cause us to rejoice and be happy

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:22.460
in the knowledge that our God is with us? Well, now in the following video, I want you to take notice

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:30.059
of this beautiful experience of a dear sister who did not have the trial removed, removed from her,

00:48:30.059 --> 00:48:34.539
but just notice how Jehovah has strengthened her to be able to endure.

00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:51.579
I was born in Malawi in 1962. I lost my eyesight at two years of age because of an eye disease.

00:48:53.739 --> 00:48:59.579
We have to rely on the reins for the food we eat and sell as it is our only source of income.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:09.820
I also look after both my parents. My father is 99 years old and my mother is 92 years old.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:19.659
Jehovah's is very time consuming. There are a lot of household chores to do to keep things clean

00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:27.260
and neat, like fetching water for our daily needs. In the evening, after we have eaten,

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:34.059
this is the time for reading. When I was young, father took the lead in our family worship,

00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:41.739
which he still does, but now because of his failing eyesight, I read to them. I read with my fingers,

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:52.059
so nighttime is no problem. My fingers are my eyes. One scripture that really touches my heart

00:49:52.139 --> 00:50:01.659
is James 5-11, which says, look, we consider happy those who have endured. Job endured his trials,

00:50:01.659 --> 00:50:09.260
and at the end, he saw all the good that Jehovah had blessed him with. This convinces me that Jehovah

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:16.139
who act in the near future, blessing us with all the things we are lacking, fulfilling all his promises,

00:50:16.139 --> 00:50:24.800
and so I am happy to endure. God's kingdom and his sovereignty are first in my life.

00:50:25.679 --> 00:50:29.840
It is only God's kingdom that will solve all these problems.

00:50:31.519 --> 00:50:36.880
I feel privileged that I have been able to save as a regular pioneer for 36 years now,

00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:47.280
and have been blessed to help 64 persons to know Jehovah. I am so happy with songs 76.

00:50:55.659 --> 00:51:02.539
I don't see myself as poor. I have the Bible and many different publications in Jehovah Braille.

00:51:02.539 --> 00:51:09.579
We have the congregation, the ministry, and our brothers and sisters. All these things make me

00:51:09.579 --> 00:51:17.900
very happy. We are not worried about our current situation because we are spiritually rich.

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:36.380
Sonyezadi kamabobun zitai.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.059
Wasn't that amazing to see that beautiful experience of our sister?

00:51:40.059 --> 00:51:44.059
Now, Jehovah hasn't taken away her trial. She's still blind.

00:51:44.059 --> 00:51:49.099
She still has a very limited means, but look how Jehovah has blessed her.

00:51:49.099 --> 00:51:54.940
Look how she's able to help so many people to come to know about Jehovah. How wonderful.

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:59.659
But now let's look at a second video. Now we're going to watch a video where

00:51:59.659 --> 00:52:05.179
Jehovah really did step in and remove a trial from our dear brother who was in a refugee camp.

00:52:05.179 --> 00:52:05.739
Let's watch.

00:52:08.219 --> 00:52:13.019
Because of the civil war, we had to take refuge in a safer part of the country.

00:52:13.019 --> 00:52:18.619
When we arrived, soldiers took us to internment camps to hold us until they could confirm our

00:52:18.619 --> 00:52:25.019
identities. In the camps, we lived in tents and it was unbearably hot in them.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:33.659
It was a struggle even to get water. We needed to wait in a queue for four to five hours every day.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:40.699
During the war, our eldest son was killed. It was a big loss for our family.

00:52:42.539 --> 00:52:47.579
All we could do to cope was pray to Jehovah and find comfort in the Bible.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:54.380
One day, the brothers from the Relief Committee came and informed us that a regional convention

00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:00.300
would be held. They had spoken to the camp officials requesting permission for us to go.

00:53:01.739 --> 00:53:06.300
For four days, morning and evening, we went to the officials to ask for permission.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:10.219
But they would not tell us if we would be released for the convention.

00:53:11.659 --> 00:53:17.179
Suddenly, one afternoon, much to our surprise, we were approved to leave the camp for five days.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:23.739
At that time, we had been in the internment camp for months. We had not been allowed to go anywhere.

00:53:23.739 --> 00:53:29.260
We were so happy that we got the permission to attend the convention, we never expected it.

00:53:31.389 --> 00:53:35.789
At the time, we had some clothes, but we had nothing for the three-day convention.

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:40.909
However, the brothers outside the camp helped us enormously.

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:46.989
They were with us cared for all our needs, so we could be ready for the convention.

00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:54.969
We still wondered where we were going to stay and how we would get our recommendations.

00:53:55.449 --> 00:54:03.289
However, when we arrived, the brothers hugged us and warmly welcomed us. We were really encouraged.

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:09.289
Even though we faced many challenges and difficulties in the internment camp,

00:54:09.769 --> 00:54:15.849
that convention was like a nourishing meal for us. It was a real joy eating at Jehovah's table.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:24.250
We can never forget those moments. After the convention, the brothers from the governing

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:29.849
body gave a special talk to those from the internment camps that are really strengthened us.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.800
The convention helped us to be courageous, especially after we returned to the camp.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.159
Although we faced many losses, the convention not only gave us comfort,

00:54:42.639 --> 00:54:45.519
but also helped us to face the challenges ahead.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.000
Now, my younger son and I are serving as ministerial servants.

00:54:51.719 --> 00:54:55.639
And my wife has been serving as a regular pioneer for the past 17 years.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:00.280
She continued pioneering even while we were in the internment camp.

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:07.159
We realized that Jehovah is always there, caring for us and sustaining us continuously.

00:55:09.289 --> 00:55:14.730
So how wonderful that our amazing God, Jehovah, helped this dear brother and his family

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.969
so that they would be able to attend the convention. Well, dear brothers, what have we seen

00:55:18.969 --> 00:55:23.289
thus far in this talk? We've been able to see that in the past, in Bible times,

00:55:23.289 --> 00:55:28.809
Jehovah was the savior of his people. And in our modern times, right now, we see how Jehovah

00:55:28.809 --> 00:55:33.769
is strengthening us and acting on our behalf so that we can continue to serve him faithfully.

00:55:34.409 --> 00:55:38.409
But now, what about the very near future? What can we say about that?

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:45.210
Well, we know that these last days are very soon going to lead into the great tribulation.

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:52.090
As Jesus said at Matthew 24-21, this is going to be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:59.610
since the world's beginning until now, nor will occur again. After the destruction of Babylon

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:04.250
the Great and before the outbreak of Armageddon, what is going to happen?

00:56:05.449 --> 00:56:13.289
Gog of Maygog, this coalition of nations is going to lead an all-out attack on Jehovah's

00:56:13.289 --> 00:56:20.570
servants. Well, now, knowing that that attack is coming closer and closer every day, how should we

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:26.409
be feeling? Should it make us feel just completely filled with anxiety? Should we be in terror of

00:56:26.409 --> 00:56:33.530
those events that are coming? Not at all. Please read with me what Jesus said here in Revelation

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:42.250
chapter 2. Now, in Revelation 2 and verse 10, Jesus is speaking to anointed Christians in the

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:49.929
congregation of Smyrna. Now, notice what he says to them. Do not be afraid of the things that you

00:56:49.929 --> 00:56:56.329
are about to suffer. Look, the devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison so that you

00:56:56.329 --> 00:57:04.409
may be fully put to the test, and you will have tribulation for 10 days, prove yourself faithful

00:57:04.409 --> 00:57:12.650
even to death, and I will give you the crown of life. Now, what do we discern from these words

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:20.809
of Jesus? Well, first of all, those who die faithfully and keep their integrity are guaranteed

00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:26.809
to have salvation from Jehovah. But there's something else that we can discern from these words.

00:57:27.849 --> 00:57:34.730
It tells us that during these last days, some of Jehovah's servants are going to experience death.

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:40.969
In our modern history already, we know our brothers have been thrown into prison, some have been

00:57:40.969 --> 00:57:48.730
tortured, and yes, some have even been put to death because of their integrity. In South Korea,

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:59.690
alone, over a period of some 70 years, 19,352 of our brothers were in prison, and five of those

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:06.409
brothers were actually put to death because of their faith. Well, what can we say about those

00:58:06.409 --> 00:58:11.929
brothers in South Korea? Those that died in Nazi Germany and those that died in Eritrea and

00:58:11.929 --> 00:58:18.650
those that died during the Soviet Union because of their faith, we know that their salvation is

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:25.929
completely assured. They are completely safe in the safest place in the universe, the memory

00:58:25.929 --> 00:58:33.929
of our Grand God, Jehovah. Well, then, what about our brothers who are experiencing persecution

00:58:33.929 --> 00:58:40.409
right now? We know that some of our brothers are watching this program right now in countries

00:58:40.409 --> 00:58:45.929
where our work is banned or under very, very severe restriction. What can we say about those

00:58:45.929 --> 00:58:51.530
dear brothers and sisters? Well, let's read together this encouraging thought. In Psalm 67,

00:58:52.250 --> 00:59:07.599
Psalm 67 and verse 1, it says, God will show us favor and bless us. He will make his face shine upon us

00:59:08.239 --> 00:59:15.360
so that your way may be known throughout the earth, your acts of salvation among all the nations.

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:20.960
Well, what's the point? You see, Jehovah is doing what verse 1 says. He's showing his favor and

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:26.320
he's blessing his people in these countries where the work is under ban. And as a result,

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:33.199
we are able to see Jehovah's acts of salvation for his people. Well, now there are so many examples

00:59:33.199 --> 00:59:38.079
of this. I wish we had another hour to be able to tell you all of them, but I'd like to just share

00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:43.519
one experience that is similar to many, many more that we have received. It comes from Russia.

00:59:44.559 --> 00:59:49.760
One of our sisters was there in the prison in Russia. Two of the female prisoners who were in

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:56.559
the cell with her were imprisoned for selling drugs. Now, one day, these two prisoners began singing

00:59:56.559 --> 01:00:02.480
songs about criminal life. Now, the sister didn't understand the language, but she just knew that

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.440
the thoughts and the ideas and these songs were immoral and foul, and she just didn't want to be

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.679
in that environment. So she prayed to Jehovah to help her. Well, suddenly, one of the women began

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:19.440
singing song number 120 from our former song book. Well, the sister was shocked. How do you know

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:26.639
this song? She asked. Then they all sang the song together. It turned out that this woman had learned

01:00:26.639 --> 01:00:31.840
the song from her mother, who had previously studied the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses and had

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:40.159
memorized the song. Our sister felt the loving hand of Jehovah in responding to her prayer so

01:00:40.159 --> 01:00:46.239
quickly. Oh, brothers, it's a wonderful experience, but there are so many similar experiences where

01:00:46.239 --> 01:00:52.639
where Jehovah has shown his hand on behalf of his people in small ways and sometimes in big ways.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:01:00.639
But let's look at one other experience. There are many examples of where our brothers in the court

01:01:00.639 --> 01:01:05.840
room during their own trials have made statements that are similar to what Shadrach,

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:11.119
Meshach and Abednego said to Nebuchadnezzar, I just want to give you one example. This is the

01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:18.480
statement from brother Sergei Skrinikov that he gave in the courtroom at his own hearing. Here's a

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:25.199
small excerpt. Let us take a look into the future. If for another 10 years or so, the government keeps

01:01:25.199 --> 01:01:31.119
putting Jehovah's Witnesses into prisons and correctional colonies, there will be about 200 of them

01:01:31.119 --> 01:01:38.719
in every prison. Imagine four congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses in one prison. The prison

01:01:38.719 --> 01:01:44.559
administrators will be begging the Ministry of Justice to set Jehovah's Witnesses free. What do

01:01:44.559 --> 01:01:50.320
you imagine the majority of the witnesses will be praying for? Lord, don't soften the heart of the

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:58.079
government. Don't let them set me free. I have so many Bible students and sincere people to talk to.

01:01:58.079 --> 01:02:06.599
Isn't that wonderful? Just hear the confidence in his voice. But then look, look how he ended

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:13.239
his statement to the court. Here's what he said, God is one and the same whether we are free or

01:02:13.239 --> 01:02:19.880
in prison. Therefore, we are not abandoned. He is with us everywhere as long as we stay faithful

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:29.400
to him. Hebrews 136 assures me, Jehovah is my helper. I will not be afraid. What can man do

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:40.440
to me? Jehovah God himself will help me of whom should I be afraid? Well, brothers,

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:47.639
Skrinikov, this very humble brother made this powerful statement in the courtroom. What does it show

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:54.119
us? Obviously, Jehovah is strengthening his people. He's giving them the power, the courage that

01:02:54.199 --> 01:03:02.920
they need to be so bold and so frank even before these powerful authorities. Well, what do we expect

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:10.199
in the very near future? This all-out attack of God of May, God will come against God's people.

01:03:10.199 --> 01:03:17.800
But when it begins, what is Jehovah going to do? Well, let me read to you just an excerpt from

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:23.239
our pure worship book that just beautifully expresses what we can expect to see.

01:03:24.519 --> 01:03:31.960
Before they are destroyed, our enemies will see the sign of the Son of Man, likely a supernatural

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:38.760
manifestation of the power of Jehovah and Jesus. The opposers will see things that cause them

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:46.360
extreme anxiety. As Jesus foretold, people will become faint out of fear and expectation

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:54.119
of the things coming upon the inhabited earth to their horror. They will realize that they miscalculated

01:03:54.119 --> 01:04:00.679
when they attacked Jehovah's people. They will be forced to know the creator in his role as

01:04:00.679 --> 01:04:08.119
military commander, Jehovah of armies. Jehovah will no doubt unleash heavenly armies and natural

01:04:08.119 --> 01:04:16.440
forces in such a way that he protects his loyal servants, but eliminates his enemies. What a powerful

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.880
description. It just reminds me of our video, a couple of years ago at our regional convention,

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:27.159
where we saw those forces coming against God's people, and then what did we see? Well, suddenly

01:04:27.159 --> 01:04:34.039
from the heavens, here is Jesus Christ, the 144,000, and all those heavenly armies riding into

01:04:34.039 --> 01:04:40.679
battle, and you remember Jesus just pulls back that bow and lets that arrow go, and all of those

01:04:40.679 --> 01:04:47.000
enemies are gone forever. Brothers and sisters, don't you just long for the day when you will see

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:54.360
those things with your own eyes? What a wonderful time. That will be when we experience the salvation

01:04:54.360 --> 01:05:03.559
of Jehovah. Well, what can we say as we have discussed this wonderful topic of Jehovah as our

01:05:03.559 --> 01:05:10.039
grand savior? Well, when we look to the future, we really can have the confidence of what Isaiah

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:21.639
chapter 12 and verse 2 says. Let's read it. Isaiah chapter 12 and verse 2. It says, look, God is my

01:05:21.639 --> 01:05:31.880
salvation. I will trust and feel no dread for Jehovah is my strength and my might, and he has become

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:40.119
my salvation. Well, just as Isaiah said, we have no reason to fear, we have no reason to dread

01:05:40.119 --> 01:05:47.960
if we have our confidence in our in our God Jehovah. Now, whether we face death with dignity

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:55.960
during these last days, or we experience miraculous deliverance at the great tribulation, either way,

01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:04.599
what can we say? We know that we will have the same outcome. We will all experience the salvation

01:06:04.599 --> 01:06:10.760
that comes from our God, Jehovah, because what is the assurance that Isaiah 54 and verse 17 gives us?

01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:20.599
No weapon formed against you will have any success. Well, brothers, if we have that confidence

01:06:20.679 --> 01:06:26.920
that Jehovah truly is our grand savior, then no matter what calamity, no matter what terror,

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:32.840
no matter what trial may come upon us now or in the future, we will be able to continue to

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:43.320
rejoice in Jehovah's acts of salvation. Thank you, brother Sanderson, for that scriptural assurance

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:51.800
that Jehovah will always act in our behalf. We invite you now to stand and sing a fitting song

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:59.800
that expresses our confidence in Jehovah. It's song number 148 entitled, Jehovah Provides the
