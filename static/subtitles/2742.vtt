Nepal. Home to the tallest peak in the world, Mount Everest. Located in the Himalayas,

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:21.260
it is bordered by China and India. As of today, Nepal is home to over 2,200 of our

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.059
brothers and sisters who zealously preach the Kingdom Good News to its more than 27 million

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:47.140
residents. Tragically, on April 25th, every day life for the people of Nepal changed. A 7.8

00:00:47.140 --> 00:01:00.189
magnitude earthquake shook the region of Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. Nepal's residents were now

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:05.629
suffering the effects of the most powerful earthquake to hit that region in over 80 years.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.719
We are quite surprised by this event. We were not prepared for a destruction of this

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:18.719
scale, but I'm happy to say that our dear brothers and sisters are hoping this situation

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.879
with calm spirit and with cool faith on Jehovah. 163 homes of our brothers were damaged,

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:35.010
91 of which were completely destroyed. As a result of the devastation, there was an acute

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:45.859
shortage of food, water and sanitary shelter. Within 24 hours, local brothers in less affected

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:52.340
areas and neighboring branch offices coordinated and began the distribution of relief supplies.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:21.139
A local disaster relief committee was formed and a medical team was dispatched to care for the

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:29.889
physical and emotional needs of those affected. Simultaneously, attention was given to providing

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.370
much needed spiritual comfort and encouragement.

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.930
Since the first drama hit us and sat at the afternoon, we are staying in the tents.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.729
The very next day elders visited us, they spoke with us, inquired about our situation.

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.250
We are very encouraged. But we are not worried about lashing and footing,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.009
our sister helped us. Within an hour, elders came to help and encouraged us.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.770
They are visiting us daily. It's beautiful. We are happy. Thank you.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.930
On May 1st, Brother Gary Bro, a representative of World Headquarters, arrived to build up those

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:57.419
who had suffered losses. A highlight of the visit was a special meeting held on May 4th,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.620
which was streamed via the internet from a kingdom hall to other congregations around the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:11.870
country. All of this only nine days after the earthquake. It is very clear that Jehovah has

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:19.310
provided the needed help spiritually, mentally and physically through his organization and through

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.910
his Holy Spirit.
