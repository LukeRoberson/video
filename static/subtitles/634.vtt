00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.750
Today, we're going to draw a lesson from the Bible book of Job.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.630
And the lesson is this, in spite of God allowing the devil to be the ruler of the world.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.670
The book of Job builds our confidence in Jehovah's supreme authority.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.550
And when we have confidence in his supreme authority, that helps us to endure.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.309
In fact, Jehovah's referred to as the Almighty 32 times in the book of Job,

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.310
which is more often than all the rest of the Scriptures.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.670
The Bible not only tells us Job's story, but it reveals the understory.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.509
What was going on behind the scenes?

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:47.950
It peels back the heavens and teaches us big lessons on Jehovah's superiority.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.469
Let's take a closer look.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:59.920
We open our Bibles now to Job chapter 1, Job chapter 1, and we can begin in verse 6.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.540
Now the day came when the sons of the true God entered to take their station

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.219
before Jehovah and Satan also entered among them.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.420
Well, the appearance of Satan here is only by Jehovah's permission.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.420
Jehovah tolerated Satan's presence so that a moral issue could be settled.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:28.819
But we need to remember, Jehovah as the sovereign of the universe was not threatened by Satan's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:37.379
presence. Jehovah stayed in control. He called the shots and his supreme authority was never in

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:45.780
danger, as we will see in the next verse, verse 7. Then Jehovah said to Satan, where have you come

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.579
from? Jehovah has the upper hand. Jehovah asks the questions, Satan gives the answers. He's in

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:02.579
control. And Jehovah knew the answer to that question, where have you come from? But by permitting

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.860
Satan to speak, it now gave opportunity for the devil to reveal to everyone else what Jehovah

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.939
already knew that he was roving about in the earth and he was up to no good.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.300
Well, now let's go to verse 8 and see what Jehovah does next. He stays in control and begins to

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:32.819
squeeze Satan. Verse 8. And Jehovah said to Satan, have you taken note of my servant, Job, or as

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.580
the footnote highlights, have you set your heart on Job? Jehovah calls Satan out. He knows what's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.139
going on. But Satan, like a coward, didn't even bring up the matter of Job. Jehovah raised the

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:53.780
subject, knowing that Satan was stewing about it the whole time. We find Jehovah reading the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.500
inmost thoughts of Satan's heart. In other words, let's get it out. Let's get it out and out it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.460
came there in verse 10. Satan says, oh, you've put up a protective head around him and you've

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.300
blessed everything in his hand. That's right. And you can do nothing about it. You see, the fact that

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.500
Satan could not remove this head shows his inferiority and Jehovah's superiority. And Jehovah has

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.300
every right to protect his interests of his people and he uses his power to do so. In the garden

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.580
of Eden, after Adam's rebellion, what did Jehovah do? He took immediate action to control the garden

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.780
of Eden and that tree of life by setting two cherubs there to protect it. Satan could not do anything

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.060
about that. And in the flood of Noah's day, what did Jehovah do? He washed away the nephalum.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.340
Satan's earthly civilization, the devil could not prevent that. Again, highlighting Jehovah's

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.780
superiority. And now in chapter 1 and verse 11, Satan says, stretch out your hand. He says,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.780
did Jehovah strike everything he has? Satan wants Jehovah to stretch out his hand and strike

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.860
Joe. No, that's not going to happen. Jehovah maintains his position and doesn't even stoop to a

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:18.339
debate. He doesn't take orders from the devil, nor does he afflict his people. But he does allow

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:26.019
Satan to test Joe up to a point. And that's in verse 12. But again, notice how Jehovah exercises

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:32.740
his superior position. In verse 12, he lets Satan persecute Joe to a degree, but he says,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.899
do not lay your hand on the man himself. And that's showing that he puts specific limits on Satan

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:47.779
and Satan obeyed, demonstrating to all that his control was not all embracing. Jehovah shows him

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:54.100
up to be a sham sovereign and it helped us inferior. And the very thing Satan craves the most

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.699
is that something he will never have. And that is, there'll always be someone on this earth that

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:06.899
clings to true worship. Well, there's chapter 1 and Satan is shown up to be an inferior and

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:16.899
Jehovah's superior power is obvious. And now in chapter 2, we have round 2 or another assembly,

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:23.779
part 2, Satan shows up again in verse 1. But again, notice verse 6 when he wants to again accuse

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:30.819
Joe of not being loyal in verse 6. Jehovah says, yes, he's in your hand, but you do not take his life.

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:38.180
Again, one more time, Satan recognized his impotence. He put Jehovah put him on notice and he

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:46.420
followed the rules. Satan complied. Well, again, showing Jehovah is almighty. And that's the point

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.740
of this discussion. It builds confidence in us and helps us to endure knowing Jehovah's superior

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:08.139
power. But now the master stroke in chapter 42 and verse 10, 42, 10. Now, Joe's trial was within

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:15.420
a few months his suffering, perhaps less than a year, and then it was over. But look what happens

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:23.420
in verse 10, after Joe prayed for his companion, Jehovah removed Joe's tribulation or turned back

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:31.180
that captive condition as the footnote highlights. So again, here we see that Jehovah, once that trial

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.819
served its purpose, once it was settled, Jehovah said enough, the gavel went down, it's over,

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:43.100
it's finished. And the supreme sovereign took immediate action and turned back that captive

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:50.540
condition. He had Satan on a short leash the whole time. And why is this important? Because again,

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.860
understanding Jehovah's superior power instills confidence in us, that he will not allow this

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:05.660
system to go on any longer than is necessary. So let's put it all together in line with Romans 15,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:13.660
24. These are the things that fortify us to endure, and that remind us that our trial will not

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:20.459
go beyond what we can bear. These are the things that convince us, Jehovah has the upper hand,

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:26.139
and whatever he permits is in line with his purpose, and that Satan is nothing but a pseudo sovereign.

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:33.019
These are the things that prove to us that our Heavenly Father is eager to turn back our captive

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:45.500
condition. Yes, these are the things that were written for our instruction.
