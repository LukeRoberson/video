00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.349
I have an illness that affects my level of energy, so I didn't feel that I could accept

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.550
just any kind of assignment.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.989
Since the end of this system is near, I want to do whatever I can that Jehovah wants

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:22.109
down to the very end, so I applied.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.710
Before attending SKE when I received my invitation, all of a sudden I had challenges or worries

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.030
about myself, I felt unworthy, even unqualified.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.789
Being a single sister, going into the class with so many couples, I thought I would be out

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.299
of place.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:48.340
I used all my abilities.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.380
I felt like my head was swelling up.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:02.229
Even so, I felt that I was really being refined and ended each day feeling fulfilled.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.629
One thing that I really enjoyed about SKE was Friday afternoons.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:10.549
That's when we had a talk from one of the governing body members.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:11.629
That was special.

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:16.909
During the eight weeks of school, such an emphasis was placed on serving by the needy's

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.469
creator, so this way of thinking became more important to us.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.909
After eight weeks attending the school, you are even ready to be set to the moon.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.909
When I was told that my next assignment would be in Mesa, Arizona, I thought, where is

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:32.909
that?

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.030
And then I thought, oh no, scorpions.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.510
And then I thought, okay, this is where to hold what things I should be, so I'm ready

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.829
to go.

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.349
One of the challenges in my new assignment was finding suitable accommodation.

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.030
There was a couple in the congregation.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.989
They had two rooms that they rented in the back of their property, but it needed some renovations.

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.469
So the brothers very quickly came together, helped, sorted out, and even build an extra

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.349
little kitchenette lounge.

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.069
So now we have a beautiful little home to go back to after a long, hot day in the ministry.

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.590
I always thought that I'd do much better in cold than I would in heat, so the brothers

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.750
and sisters were very helpful in making sure that I stayed hydrated, making sure I knew

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.430
how to handle myself in the heat, giving me pointers of things to carry, and they made

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.669
sure that I had an extra large, large bottle with me.

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:33.750
We really felt supported by the congregation because they found us an apartment.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.629
This meant that we could concentrate on our ministry.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.430
One of the things that really helped me was an experienced brother, who gave an encouraging

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.830
comment about whether my health would permit me to attend the school.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.150
He said, if she can pioneer, then it's also possible for her to attend the school.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.949
The education that we received at SKE, especially it helped us with our qualities, our personality,

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:07.710
putting on a new personality, that really will help us not only now in our assignment,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.180
but right through into the new world.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.500
I think there are many who could meet the qualifications with just a little more effort.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.379
Please know that there is a wonderful education program, and we were able to experience it

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.139
in our 60s.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.860
We could get through it.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.300
So if others are thinking of applying, I want to tell them that we were able to do it.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.229
And by all means, I want them to taste the same joy that we experienced.

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:50.909
You could be nervous and have performance anxiety, and worry about how will I handle answering,

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.590
and how about all of the student assignments and the test.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.229
Worries like that, but for my own part, it was two months with an incredible amount

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.229
of joy.

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.229
And you have to focus on that.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.229
It is a gift.

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.229
It is a wonderful gift from Jehovah.

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:13.229
I wasn't sure if I was going to put in the application because I thought maybe I wanted to do it

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:20.230
as a couple rather than as a single person, but I prayed to Jehovah about it, and I put my application in.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.230
I wouldn't be experiencing the happiness that I have now if I had waited.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.230
So I'm happy that I just put my application in and let Jehovah do the rest.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.230
And now sometimes I'm driving down the freeway and I think, wow Jehovah, I'm so happy.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.230
Thank you.
