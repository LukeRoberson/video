00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.290
and introduction to 2nd Thessalonians.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.810
The Apostle Paul was inspired to write this weighty letter in Corinth about 51CE shortly

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.809
after he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:25.010
In his first letter, Paul encouraged the brothers to live quietly, to mine their own business,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.809
and to work hard to care for their physical needs.

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:31.410
This council was still appropriate.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.329
Evidently, some were still meddling in the affairs of others, and were reluctant to work

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.810
to provide for their material needs.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.490
Also, the congregation may have received letters or messages that appeared to be from

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:53.450
the Apostle Paul or other responsible brothers, saying that the day of Jehovah is here.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.880
The 2nd letter to the Thessalonians has three chapters.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.840
In chapter 1, Paul commends the brothers for their faith and endurance, and he explains

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.599
that those suffering tribulation will get relief when the glorified Christ comes in kingdom

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:15.459
power to destroy God's enemies.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:21.099
In chapter 2, Paul's letter explains that certain things must happen before Jehovah's

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:24.019
Day arrives.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:28.859
Those things include the development of a great apostasy and the revealing of the man of

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.299
lawlessness, a composite group of apostate religious leaders.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:41.219
This symbolic man would exalt himself over the congregations.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.219
Did you know?

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.060
Because a letter falsely attributed to Paul may have been circulating, he wrote,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.900
here is my greeting, Paul's, in my own hand, which is a sign in every letter, this is

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.370
the way I write.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.010
In chapter 3, Paul counsels the congregation to Mark and stops socializing with any members

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.050
who are still walking disorderly, perhaps because of their being unwilling to work.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.449
Yet the congregation should not consider these ones enemies, but should instead admonish

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.169
them as brothers.

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:26.080
The goal is to move them to repentance.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.639
As you read 2 Thessalonians, note how Satan can use proud wicked men to corrupt the pure

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.080
teachings of Christ.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.360
How we are wise to stop socializing with disorderly ones while admonishing them as brothers,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.719
and how we need to endure tribulation as we patiently await kingdom rule.
