00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.139
So last week we talked about the true God. Do you remember what his name is according to the Bible?

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:11.640
Yes, Jehovah. Very good. He created everything in heaven and on earth.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.140
At the bottom of page 7 is an illustration of a man.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.140
Do you remember who that is? That's the first man Adam. Yes.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.140
So in our discussion today, we're going to talk about what life was like in paradise.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.940
So let's look at pages 8 and 9.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.939
At the top, you see Adam walking towards someone. Who do you think that is?

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:38.939
It looks like it's a woman. Her name was Eve. Right.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:43.439
The Bible says that after Jehovah created Adam, he made the first woman.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.439
Then he gave the woman to Adam to be his wife.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.439
How do you think Adam felt when he first saw his wife?

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:52.439
I think he must have been very, very happy.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:58.439
I agree. The scripture at the bottom of the page is from Genesis 128.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:59.939
Let's read that.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.200
Further, God bless them and God said to them, be fruitful and become many.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.200
Fill the earth and subdue it and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.200
It says here that God blessed them. If you look at them standing here, how would you say that God blessed them?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.700
Well, God gave them a beautiful garden to live in.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.700
Yes. What are some of the nice things you see in the garden?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.700
Well, I see a waterfall and a river, so there's lots of water.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.700
There's beautiful flowers and a fruit tree. And I see animals.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
Yes. Doesn't this picture look a lot like the one on pages 2 and 3?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.200
Mm-hmm.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.200
Now, remember the verse we just read said that Adam and Eve had every living creature in subjection.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
That means the animals were under the care of humans.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
So the animals were at peace with Adam and Eve.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.700
That's why in this illustration, Adam and Eve don't seem to be worried about the lion behind them.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.199
And did you notice that Adam and Eve are depicted as being young and healthy?

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.199
Yes, I did.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:19.699
Genesis 128 says God blessed them. So would you think God created them to grow old and die?

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.199
Mm-hmm. That's a good question.

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:29.199
Well, that Bible verse says that Jehovah wanted them to be fruitful and become many and fill the earth.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:35.699
In other words, Adam and Eve were given the job of expanding their family and the garden until the whole earth was filled.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.699
How long do you think would it take for Adam and Eve to do that?

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.699
I'm sure it would have taken hundreds of years.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.199
Yes.

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:53.699
So in order for Adam and Eve to fulfill that assignment, Jehovah gave them minds and bodies that were perfect without any flaw, they were designed to live forever.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.199
That's very interesting.

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:01.699
But in order for Adam and Eve to live forever, they needed to listen to God and obey Him.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.199
Now look at the picture at the top of page 9.

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.699
Let's talk a little bit about who that is.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.699
Notice his wings.
