00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:22.679
I was very young, I was religiously inclined, and my dream was to get married to a man that worshipped God, and that together we would worship God and live a peaceful life.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:31.679
That didn't happen with my parents. We often had a better relationship with the maid than with my mother.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:47.170
My father was a very distant person. He was always very busy with his work and friends. We wed in 1971 in Paris, France.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.170
We were baptized in 1974.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:01.170
I realized I really didn't know how to raise children, and then I started applying some things mentioned in the Bible.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:12.579
If I wanted to teach them right, I first had to understand things better myself so that I could explain them in a way that God would want us to.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:20.579
In 1976, we moved to Portugal to serve where there was more need.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:29.579
By then, our oldest son was four and a half years old. Maria was three and a half, and Benjamin one and a half.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.579
I remember when we arrived, we lived in a rural area.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:40.579
It was a very small congregation, so we really had to participate from very early age.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:54.579
They wanted to put, for sure, the spiritual interests first in their life, and they wanted not to only tell us to put the Kingdom interest first, but they wanted to show us how to do it.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:01.579
And it's not only that we sit down for a family study that's when we talk about Jehovah and spiritual things.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:11.580
I remember walking back home from meetings, and then my parents would help us to look for star constellations, a star's conversation about Jehovah.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:22.580
In Deuteronomy chapter 6, it says that we must always talk to our children, that it's good to talk about God and help them to see God as a real person,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.580
a person that is linked to everything around us.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.580
So now, I wanted to teach them very much.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.580
And not that things about God were sad or boring, but were joyful.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.580
Of course, we were imperfect.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.580
Many times, I did the wrong things.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.580
I never remember you have to do it because you have to do it.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.580
They always tried to explain the reasons, Bible reasons.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.580
I was brought up this way.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.580
My parents dictated laws. You have to do this.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.580
You must. This is the way I wanted to be.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.580
But I came to understand that God, even in the Bible, instead of only giving or dictating laws, he explains them.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.580
He gives so many reasons. He gives reasons for everything.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.580
By teaching my children, I have to say that I have learned a lot too.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.580
We never felt that we must go to meeting, we must go in service because you have to do it.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.580
And we were always motivated to do things.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.580
I remember, for example, when he gave me a new Bible,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.580
and he wrote to me that Bible,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.580
made his book always be the motivating force in your life.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.580
Several times, he told me,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.580
please never, never give up in your service.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:54.430
Jehovah is your father, and you have to serve him all your life.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.430
The Almighty has children that fail to respond,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.430
much like any other parent.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.430
God does not force anyone.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.430
He respects our free will very much.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.430
So, we wanted them to build their own future.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.430
I always felt that my children were not my own,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.430
but it was Jehovah who kindly put them into our hands.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.430
He entrusted them to us so that we could care for them.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.430
And then, when we have done our part, let them fly.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:48.779
My parents always encourages us to pursue full-time service,

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.779
even if that meant moving far away from all.

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:59.139
My husband and I are serving as filmmakers in Clipadalitwini.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.139
I know I will be grateful for all eternity that I used my youth to search Jehovah,

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:14.699
and I didn't waste my years of young age doing things for this world.

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.699
My wife and I have served in the Portugal branch office.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.699
If Jehovah is happy, if my parents are happy, I'm happy too.

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.699
I'm really sure that they like what we are doing.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.699
They are happy with that.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.339
We rejoice that our children are giving their best to the Creator,

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:38.339
and making him happy. Jehovah deserves that.

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:43.339
Of course, we miss our children, and we would like to have them around.

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:51.339
But we are very happy for them for having the privilege of serving Jehovah the way they are.
