WEBVTT

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.049
I'm so happy to welcome today a very dear friend of mine,

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.950
brother Robert P. Johnson.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.189
RP, welcome to the program.

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:11.390
Thank you, Mark.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.789
I appreciate being here.

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.890
Now, you're here, RP, because you are a wonderful example

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.429
of someone who's had a life filled with blessings

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.030
in Jehovah's service.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.570
So I know that your family goes way back in the truth.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.769
In fact, I understand that you're great grandfather

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.770
learned the truth in brother Russell's time,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.270
even before 1914.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.270
That's right.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.270
So that means you're a fourth generation witness.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270
But now, like so many who are watching our program,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.770
you were a little boy growing up in a congregation

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.270
of Jehovah's people.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270
So how did you come to the decision

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.770
that you wanted to dedicate your life to serve Jehovah

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.270
and then get baptized?

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.270
Well, Mark, thinking back, I can identify

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.269
at least two outstanding influences in my life.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.269
And the first was my parents.

00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:10.269
Having that heritage in the truth helped me.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:14.269
I was just an average kid in my early years.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:19.269
But the parents instilled in me a desire

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:24.269
to please Jehovah and make it my life to do that.

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:26.269
They said goals before me.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:28.269
They taught me the truth.

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:32.269
I learned enough from them to be able to make a dedication

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:36.269
to Jehovah God and to have a close relationship with him.

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:40.769
And so early on, that's what I did.

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:43.769
I remember that evening, after supper,

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:50.769
in my bedroom, praying to Jehovah to accept my dedication.

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:55.269
The date was May 25, 1949.

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:58.269
I was 11 years old at the time.

00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:01.269
I told my parents and they were happy.

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:05.269
But they just wanted me to wait longer to make sure,

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:09.770
especially how I would handle the teenage years and so on.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.770
So I would.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.270
And so then when did the moment come for you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.270
to finally get baptized?

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.270
I was at the 1953 International Convention,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.270
Yankee Stadium, New York, on July 22, 1953,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.270
that I was baptized.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.270
And again, I remember that like it was yesterday.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.270
Well, I came up out of the water.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.270
I thank Jehovah for that.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.270
Finally, I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.270
And I also, like a child, edit.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.270
You can bring the end anytime now.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.270
So you mentioned your parents,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.270
the good influence they had on you.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.270
But was there another influence on you that helped you?

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.270
Yes.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.270
At the 53 convention, Brother Nor had identified

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.270
that there would be a special program for training people

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.270
in the truth.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.270
And from the congregation, there was a brother

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.270
of the anointed named Charles Richardson.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.270
And my father asked Brother Richardson

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.270
to train me in this training program.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.270
And Brother Richardson was a mentor to me

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.270
for the next five years of my life.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.270
Over the years, he helped me view the ministry

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.270
as an opportunity to help people

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.270
develop a relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.270
And therefore to reach out to them

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.270
in teaching them the truth, the doctrinal truth,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.270
but to help them to see Jehovah as a real person.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.270
And he helped me to enjoy the ministry.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.270
That is what has kept me happy

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.270
in Jehovah's service down to this day.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.270
Now, just from your expressions

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.270
and what you talked about with me before,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.270
I could see that this brother Richardson

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.270
had a tremendous impact on your life.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.270
And I think it really made you want

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.270
to be a trainer of other people

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.270
because that's how I first met you, right?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.269
Right, right.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.269
You were the brother assigned to be my trainer

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.269
when I came to the service department.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.269
I remember that fondly.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:24.269
And I know that I'm not the only one.

00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:26.269
I mean, you've really spent your whole life training

00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:28.269
other people.

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:31.269
Well, they spent a privilege.

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:33.269
And I was trained.

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:35.269
I was helped along the way.

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:38.269
I was nobody special, but Jehovah's

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:40.269
extended undeserved kindness to me.

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:43.269
And made all these things possible.

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:45.269
So there's no excuse for me not passing

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:47.269
along the baton.

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:52.269
And it's a delight for me to see others carry it.

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:54.269
So now, let's come back.

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:56.269
You're 15 years old.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:58.269
You get baptized, Yankee Stadium.

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:02.269
And now, as a result of being baptized at this age,

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:05.269
how do you feel you were benefited?

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:07.269
For one thing,

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:10.269
you know what you want to do.

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:12.269
And you stay focused on it.

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:14.269
It makes it easier to deal with

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:16.269
whatever challenge come later.

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:24.269
And so being dedicated and baptized early in life

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:28.269
helped me to stay focused on the truth.

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:32.269
I still remember that dedication.

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:34.269
It means something to me.

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:39.269
And I tried to make it mean something to others

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:42.269
for as young as they can possibly make it.

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:45.269
And they'll find the same thing I found.

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:47.269
Jehovah's blessing will be with them.

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:49.269
So now, at 15,

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:51.269
what doors start to open up?

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:53.269
What opportunities come to you?

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.269
Because you are a baptized brother.

00:05:55.269 --> 00:06:00.269
At age 17, I was appointed as a ministerial servant.

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:03.269
I started pioneering right out of high school.

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:05.269
At age 18.

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:08.269
And serving where the need was greater,

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:12.269
I got a chance to work at starting a new congregation.

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:15.269
And so, at 21, I was a congregation servant

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:17.269
or an elder at that point.

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:19.269
Then, there was a need.

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:24.269
The organization was looking for brothers who could do traveling work.

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:26.269
So, at age 25,

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:30.269
I had the privilege of being a traveling overseer.

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:32.269
So now, how did you feel?

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:34.269
Being elder at 21,

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.269
being a circuit overseer at 25,

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:39.269
was it a little bit overwhelming at such a young age?

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:41.269
I was scared.

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:44.269
I knew the truth.

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:49.269
But I was uncertain about myself.

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:52.269
But then I also know Jehovah would help me.

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:56.269
I learned a lot as a young traveling overseer.

00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:03.269
And I thank Jehovah that the people in the circuits that I served endured

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:05.269
those three years.

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:09.269
But now, that was the challenges.

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:15.269
But what do you see as being the benefits of having a young traveling overseer?

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.269
For the congregation,

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:21.269
they had somebody who could stay out and feel service long hours.

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:24.269
And also,

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:29.269
the younger traveling overseer could relate to the young people

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:34.269
and the younger adults in the congregation.

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:37.269
There were other benefits that even today,

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:41.269
different ones that I served in earlier circuits,

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:43.269
bring forth to me.

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:46.269
For example, after having a good time in field service

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:48.269
and then the meetings,

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:52.269
I would do recreational things with the kids.

00:07:52.269 --> 00:07:57.269
And we read track out in the streets

00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:02.269
and we played board games, softball, basketball.

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:07.269
And then we had good times just talking about the truth

00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:13.269
and also talking about how you can put your ministry first

00:08:13.269 --> 00:08:17.269
and there's plenty of time for seeking a mate later.

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:21.269
So now, for a time, you were serving as a single brother.

00:08:21.269 --> 00:08:24.269
But at some point, that changed.

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:26.269
When did that happen?

00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:29.269
I have enjoyed the best of two worlds.

00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:34.269
I enjoyed singleness and the blessings Jehovah gave me.

00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:38.269
But when I was 28 years old,

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:42.269
I married a beautiful pioneer sister.

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:46.269
And I had already gotten adjusted in my circuit work

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:48.269
this was my second circuit.

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:50.269
So thanks to Jehovah,

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:52.269
we were able to be married

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:53.269
and to this day,

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:57.269
Gracie and I continued in full-time service

00:08:57.269 --> 00:09:00.269
after 52 years of marriage.

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:04.269
So RP, you started with circuit work

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:06.269
and then later you went on to district work.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:07.269
Right.

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:10.269
And then you were teaching the Kenan ministry school.

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:12.269
And then you got invited to Bethel.

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:13.269
Right.

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:16.269
And 31 years at Bethel, right?

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:17.269
Oh, yes.

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:19.269
And now you and Gracie,

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:21.269
you're doing a special pioneer work.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.269
Right.

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:23.269
In Orlando, Florida.

00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:26.269
So more than 60 years

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:29.269
of full-time service to Jehovah.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:32.269
It's because of Jehovah's blessing

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:34.269
and it has made me happy.

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:37.269
So the question I want to ask you is

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:39.269
when you're looking back now,

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:41.269
these 60 wonderful years,

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:43.269
more than 60 wonderful years,

00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:46.269
what would you say to young people

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:49.269
who are facing the same decision that you face

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:52.269
when you were a little boy growing up in the truth?

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:56.269
It's the best thing I could have done with my life.

00:09:56.269 --> 00:10:00.269
And I had many opportunities.

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:04.269
Jehovah blessed my humble efforts

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:08.269
as he has blessed you and others too.

00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:13.269
The young people today have even more opportunities

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:15.269
because Jehovah's organization

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:17.269
under the leadership of Jesus Christ

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:21.269
is expanding and moving fast.

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:24.269
And like Brother Richardson taught me,

00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:27.269
if you just make yourself available,

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:32.269
then the organization will find a place for you

00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:33.269
and use you.

00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:36.269
And that's so true today.

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:40.269
One of my greatest joys is to see the young people

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:43.269
take the baton and run with it.

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:48.269
And I have no regrets.

00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:52.269
There's been no challenge that overwhelmed me

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:54.269
and made me regret things.

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:56.269
There were challenges, of course.

00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:58.269
But with Jehovah's help,

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:00.269
well, I'm here today.

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:03.269
And that can be true of our young people.

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:08.269
So seize the opportunity while you're young

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:12.269
and experience the blessing that Jehovah gives,

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:16.269
those who serve him from youth onward.

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:20.269
RP, it has been such a wonderful joy to have you here

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:21.269
on this program.

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:25.269
And to hear about your life filled with joy,

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:27.269
your life filled with blessings,

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:30.269
all because of the decision you made,

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:33.269
just as a little boy, to dedicate your life to Jehovah

00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:35.269
and get baptized.

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:36.269
Thank you so much.

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:37.269
Thank you.

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:39.269
I appreciate talking about it.
