00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.809
The theme of this program is taken from the second part of Romans 12-10

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.490
and showing honor to one another, take the lead.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.329
What is honor? In the Hebrew scriptures, the term translated honor literally means

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:23.809
heaviness. So when we honor someone, we're acknowledging that he's weighty or that he

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:30.050
mounts to something. In the Greek scriptures, the word is related to setting a price on something,

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:34.130
meaning that the one we honor is esteemed or has value.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.369
Whom should we honor? Of course, Jehovah is worthy of honor.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.929
Revelation chapter 4 verse 11 says this and gives us the reason for giving glory and honor to Jehovah.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.049
It says because he created all things. He is responsible for us having life in the first place.

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.650
How do we give him honor? There are many ways that we honor him by doing his will,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.689
obeying his laws and principles. We honor him by extolling his qualities and promises,

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.170
telling others about these gifts from God. We show him honor by contributing financially

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.730
to the worldwide educational work that he's directing through his son and Holy Spirit.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.689
And just as Revelation chapter 4 said about Jehovah being worthy of the honor,

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.769
Revelation chapter 5 verse 12 says that his son Christ Jesus is worthy of the same.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.010
Verse 12 says of Jesus, they were saying with a loud voice, the lamb who slaughtered is worthy

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.890
to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:02.689
How do we show honor to Jesus? One way is acknowledged in the verse we just read.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.169
He was slaughtered like a sacrificial lamb so that we might have the hope of everlasting life.

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:17.169
We highly esteem and value that sacrifice. We honor Jesus by recognizing his role as an immortal

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:22.370
king of kings in the heavens. And another very practical way to honor Jesus

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.689
is to strive to imitate his life and personality as the model for us to follow closely.

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:35.889
If we take the lead in showing honor, who else will we view as highly valued to be treated

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.650
with esteem? Ephesians 6 1 and 2 says that children honor their father and mother when

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.930
they're obedient to them. Matthew 15 4 through 6 makes it clear that adult children honor their

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.129
parents and grandparents by giving material assistance to them as needed. First Timothy 5 or 17

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.090
urges us to give elders double honor because of their hard work in our behalf.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.330
Romans 13, 1 and 7 even extends the matter of showing honor to governmental rulers and

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:21.409
others in authority. First Peter 2 verse 17 broadens the meaning of honor even further saying

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.689
honor men of all sorts. In addition to being kind and respectful to people in general,

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:37.330
we also honor them by being willing to spend time sharing the good news with them. Ephesians 5 22

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.889
through 25 appeals to wives to honor their husbands by having Christ-like subjection for them.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.810
Husbands are to honor their wives by showing them love and treating them just as Jesus treated

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.449
the congregation. And what about our theme text for this discussion?

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:04.210
Who was Paul addressing in Romans chapter 12 when he said and showing honor to one another take

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:14.129
the lead? Who hardly one another in that verse? Look at Romans chapter 1 and verse 7 with me.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:23.009
Paul says he's writing to all those who are in Rome as God's beloved ones call to be holy ones.

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:29.009
So all of us in the Christian congregation are to have honor for each other.

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:37.889
I'd like to spend the balance of my time discussing two of the many opportunities we have to show honor.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.970
They're the last two that I just referenced. First, marriage mates showing honor to each

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.889
other and second, showing honor to one another in our congregations. Marriage is in general today

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:01.250
are seriously lacking in honor. Marriage mates often demean one another with harsh words and

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.370
disrespectful attitudes. Some in the world resort to physical violence as if that somehow makes

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:15.490
the abusive one right in his view of what are the issue is. An infidelity, a part of one or both

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:23.810
mates is so common. It doesn't even raise eyebrows anymore. All of this is a gross lack of honor

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:31.410
and marriage. But what about marriages of those professing to be Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:39.970
We're blessed with so many marriages that are wholesome and honorable, true, none are perfect.

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:46.689
But how blessed we are to have the truth and to have learned to be more and more Christlike with each

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:55.569
other. We've learned to shed things we heard when we're growing up. However, the matter of honoring

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:02.529
our marriage mate needs to be discussed while relatively few of our marriages end up with some

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:10.290
kind of physical violence and relatively few end up in divorce. What about having honor in the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:17.410
marriage? After living together as husband and wife for many months or for years or even for

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.610
decades, familiarity can cause us to treat each other with less respect or honor than when we

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:33.810
were courting. That isn't right. It isn't Christlike. But with our inherited imperfection,

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:40.850
we may succumb to dishonable words and behavior with the one we promise to treasure until death

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:48.610
do us part. How can we get a grip on this trait and minimize the times that we have a clash of

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:57.970
spirit and words? First, let's consider the two basic responsibilities assigned to marriage mates.

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:07.699
This is the foundation that we can then build on to improve. The role of the husbands clearly

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:15.779
stated at 1 Corinthians 11 and verse 3, and while some wives in society made bristle at this thought,

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:25.860
why serving Jehovah are to embrace this thought? It's the arrangement of God. 1 Corinthians 11 and

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:32.339
verse 3 says, but I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ and turn the head of

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:40.819
a woman as the man and turn the head of the Christ is God. God's word says that the head of a woman

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:49.540
is the man. However, the head of the woman is not to be a domineering man, not an abuse of man

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:57.300
verbally or physically. He used to imitate his head. And who is that? What did the first part of

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:07.139
the verse say? They head of every man is the Christ. In fact, Ephesians chapter 5 strikes this

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:14.500
fine balance between being ahead of the wife and being a loving head like the Christ. Ephesians 5,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:23.620
22 and 23 says, let wise be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord. What of the disposition

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:31.139
of the husband? Because a husband is head of his wife, just as the Christ is head of the congregation,

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:42.740
he being a savior of this body. That verse says it all. Verse 33 of the same chapter says this,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:51.139
each one of you must love his wife as he does himself. On the other hand, the wife should have

00:08:51.139 --> 00:09:00.820
deep respect for her husband. There's nowhere in God's word that says that if one mate pushes the

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:07.139
other mate's button emotionally, that it cancels the offended mate's obligation to be Christ-like.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:16.659
The problem is that when one mate is offended or hurt, it's so easy to roll the eyes and discuss

00:09:17.379 --> 00:09:24.179
or to lash back with a verbal insult. Then the other mate fires back with another harsh cutting

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:31.539
remark. It's like when on a forest fire, temper's blaze in the evening goes up in smoke.

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:42.259
It's not at all Christ-like. There's no honor shown in such a conflagration. It has to stop sooner

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:54.769
rather than later. The January 15th 2015 issue of the Watchtower said this, remember that marriage

00:09:54.769 --> 00:10:01.009
is not a competition to find out who is stronger, who can shout louder, or who can think of the most

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:09.330
cutting remark. True, we all have flaws and sometimes we upset others, but there is never a

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:16.529
justifiable reason for either a husband or a wife to use sarcastic and demeaning speech or worse

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:27.169
to shove or hit each other. How can we change the atmosphere? Someone needs to put out the fire

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:35.970
with the water of God's Word. Romans 12, 10, and then be part again in showing honor to one

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:45.330
other, take the lead. One of the mates must take the lead, even if at the time they're apologizing

00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:50.049
for their own behavior, acknowledging that they didn't respond in a Christ-like way saying,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:11:00.799
forgive me. That same issue of the Watchtower cited two scriptures, one for the husband and one for

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:11.840
the wife. We'll first read Proverbs 17, verse 27. Husbands listen to this and apply it prior to a

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:21.279
rift, or even during the conflict, Proverbs 17, 27. A man of knowledge restrains his words

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:35.220
and a discerning man will remain calm. Husbands, does that describe us? Now wives, please locate

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:44.720
Proverbs 31, 26. Does this describe your speech even when some altercation occurs?

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:53.440
Proverbs 31, 26. She opens her mouth in wisdom. The law of kindness is on her tongue.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.600
Usually after a misunderstanding and rash words have been said, we feel miserable and upset.

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:09.519
We often chastise ourselves or adding fuel to the fire. How much better to train ourselves to

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:19.629
restrain our words and remain calm and to speak in wisdom and with kindness of tongue? Meet Emuel

00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:26.990
in Faruca, Garbovon from Romania. Their good examples of how the power of God's word can mold and

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:37.470
change the attitudes of marriage mates, willing to be guided by it. It was in 1983 when I met

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:46.590
Filuca. I already had two little girls. One was seven years old and the other one was three.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:53.389
I accepted to study the Bible. My husband worked as a warrant officer for the police,

00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:58.429
so at the beginning I studied in secret. Then I decided to tell him the truth.

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:08.110
When I found out that my wife was studying the Bible in order to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:16.269
I became very sad. And I realised that our marriage, our family was in danger because I only

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:25.360
knew bad things about Jehovah's Witnesses. He threatened he would divorce me and he did.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:34.190
The divorce was a very difficult time in my life because I was seven months pregnant with our

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:42.029
third daughter. Following the divorce, my husband was given the house and the custody of our two

00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:50.620
daughters. I had to leave the house and I stayed for almost a year with two families of our brothers.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:14:01.970
I saw Jehovah's love towards me and I loved Jehovah very much, but I loved my husband too.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.279
One day as I was walking and holding the little girl's hand, I saw Filuca's husband walking

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:21.200
toward me. My heart stopped and I said to myself, he is going to hit me.

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:27.200
Patemil was a gentleman and he took the little girl in his arms,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.360
talked to her for a few minutes and then he put her back down and left.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:40.240
When I saw him leaving, I thanked Jehovah because he didn't beat me.

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:50.820
In 1990, I looked for my wife and I told her that I would like to remarry her to reunite our family.

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:57.139
And after a while, she agreed and step by step I started to study.

00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:06.899
In 2003, I became one of Jehovah's Witnesses. I am very happy that I made this change

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:17.309
and I regret that I didn't do it sooner. I personally saw how the truth can change a person's

00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:28.450
life even in my own family. Currently, I serve as an elder and in 2010, I became a regular pioneer.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:37.919
When I see Emil conduct the Bible study next to me, I feel like kneeling rather than standing

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:48.960
to thank Jehovah. So to married couples who loved Jehovah, we repeat and showing honor,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.120
take the lead. The principles of just discussed can also be applied when showing honor

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.919
to others in the congregation. Like the husband and wife that we just discussed,

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:06.639
all of us should be improving in imitating Jesus and in following his steps closely

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:10.639
in all of our interactions with fellow believers in the congregation.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.679
How do we show honor to one another? One way is well described at First Corinthians

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:25.279
chapter 10, verse 23, and verse 24. We show honor when we put the other person's feelings and needs

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:34.879
ahead of our own. First Corinthians 10, 23, and 24. All things are lawful, but not all things

00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:42.000
are advantageous. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. Let each one keep seeking

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:50.320
not his own advantage, but that of the other person. We show honor when we suppress our own rights.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:57.759
What we do or say might be lawful, but is it advantageous? Will it build up?

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:07.200
Verse 24 then concisely says it, keep seeking not our own advantage or right, but that of the other

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:15.759
person. We show honor to others when we do good deeds for them. Possibly it's even a humble task

00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:21.680
that an elderly publisher needs done. It could be offering to clean the house, take them to the

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:30.960
store or fill some other need. The principal is at Luke 22, verse 26, you though are not to be that

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.640
way, but let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest and the one taking the

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:46.079
lead as the one ministering. Earlier, I cited 1st Timothy 517 where we're urged to give elders

00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:52.240
double honor because of their hard work in our behalf. They're also part of our congregation

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:59.200
and deserve honor. In our August program last year, brother let helped us consider much of what

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.599
is involved. You'll recall that his subject was appreciating our gifts in men.

00:18:07.279 --> 00:18:13.440
We minister to or honor others when we readily forgive them if they've embarrassed us or

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:20.559
heard our feelings. Overall, Jehovah's people do quite well in honoring one another in the congregation.

00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:28.799
But here's the question, are we improving in this aspect of our Christian personality?

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:37.279
In our theme scripture, Paul didn't just say to honor one another. He said to why now

00:18:37.279 --> 00:18:45.039
or reach out in this aspect of our Christian life, his words were to take the lead.

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:51.920
If Paul had just said to show honor to each other, that would be like a teacher urging a group of

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:58.319
literate students to learn to read. If they're literate, they don't need to learn to read.

00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:05.359
But what might be the teacher urging them to do? He might encourage them to read better

00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:14.559
or to improve. Love is the identifying mark of Christ's disciples. So honor is something we've

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:23.920
learned to show. However, like the teacher, Paul is urging us to improve in this area. He said,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.039
take the lead in showing honor. The footnote says this could be rendered taking the initiative

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.359
in showing honor. Instead of waiting for some obvious reason to do good for others to commend someone

00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:46.240
to check on a shut-in, look for opportunities to take the initiative to show honor in the family

00:19:46.240 --> 00:20:00.880
and in our congregations. Yes, in showing honor, take the lead.
