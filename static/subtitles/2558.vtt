00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.360
We begin our program by revisiting the Philippines.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.359
Two years ago, this month, Typhoon Hayan devastated that country,

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:17.359
and many of the 185,000 witnesses living there were in the direct path of the storm.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:25.359
The effort our brothers made to search for and provide relief to fellow Christians was remarkable.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.359
What did it take to bring that story to the worldwide brotherhood?

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.770
Typhoon Hayan struck the Philippines early morning on Friday, November the 8th.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.770
Less than a week later, the governing body already decided they wanted a video to help document the relief efforts,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.770
as well as brother Sanderson's visit to encourage the friends.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.770
With the Philippines Typhoon Hayan's story, it was very important to turn it around quickly,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.770
because it's a current news event, and all the people, the brothers and sisters there that were suffering,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.770
we hoped it would be very encouraging for them to get this story quickly,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.770
as well as witness for the country.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.769
As soon as we received official permission from the writing committee,

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:10.769
we immediately sent out memos to the Philippines branch, as well as to the Korean branch.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:14.769
We started to engage them in video conferences, but I was a little bit of a challenge,

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:19.769
because the Philippines is 13 hours difference in Korea's 14 hours difference.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:27.769
When we first were asked to do this project, I think we felt somewhat underqualified in the Philippines,

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:32.769
but when we started thinking about how important it was to do this video,

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:36.769
and for the brothers all over the world to know what was happening to their brothers in the Philippines

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:42.769
and how they were being helped, well, that helped us get a feeling that this had real priority,

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.769
and we really needed to do what we could to help.

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:49.769
We decided to use a small crew from the Korean branch.

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:53.769
They had to plan, purchase, and get everything ready to go within two weeks' time.

00:01:53.769 --> 00:02:01.219
It was much worse than we had thought before we arrived there.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.219
I thought it was too severe to be true.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:12.009
Many houses of witnesses and kingdom halls were totally destroyed.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:20.699
It was not so easy getting into those disaster areas after the typhoon,

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.699
because it just tore the infrastructure apart in that area.

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:29.699
So, for example, the airport in Takloban City was pretty much half destroyed.

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:34.699
As we can imagine, when they went into this area, this was a disaster area,

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.699
so it can be very overwhelming.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.699
So, while the team from Korea was shooting,

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.699
we would interact with them, given them ideas of what type of shots to get

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:48.699
and be able to focus their attention when in chaos.

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.699
It worked well. We were able to get done what was needed to be done

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.699
and in a reasonable amount of time.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.699
If that's the one that's badly damaged because of the water.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.699
We had brought two cameras.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.699
However, when you arrived in the Philippines,

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.699
our second camera suddenly didn't work.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.699
The main camera worked very well during whole shoot.

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.699
Afterwards, we realized that using two cameras

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:21.699
would only have slowed down our working pace.

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.699
Another big challenge that we had in connection with the video equipment

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.699
was that in most areas that we went to where there was so much destruction,

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.699
there was no electricity.

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.699
So, obviously, we had to keep on shooting,

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.699
but there was no place to plug in.

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.699
On one occasion, the brothers at the Kingdom all had a little generator,

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.699
so we were able to rev that up at night,

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.699
plug in our equipment and get it recharged.

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.699
So, the next day, then, we were able to go on with the shootings.

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.699
We worked for over 15 hours a day.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.699
Our future brothers were always with us,

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.699
so we felt safe.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:05.699
We really appreciate the brothers who assisted the project in many ways,

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.699
such as the brother who drove even at the very late night

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.699
and the brother who arranged the older scheduling,

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.699
having them, we could finish the project successfully.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.170
We found it was getting easy to find encouraging stories,

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.170
as we were interviewing more and more local brothers.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.170
Through those spiritual upbuilding conversations,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.170
we came to obviously realize what makes Philippine brothers overcome their difficulties,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:43.170
and we all agree the same things also made us encourage much as well.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.170
That is definitely Jehovah's powerful and loving spirit.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.170
We never became too tired to keep up our tight schedule,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.170
despite tropical hot weather and sad situation out there.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:06.209
We could feel that he imparted power beyond what is normal to us.

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:09.209
Once the team from Korea was done gathering the footage,

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:12.209
the next step was to get all of that footage back to us here.

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:17.209
There was 888 gigabytes worth of material, almost a terabyte,

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:19.209
which is about 20 hours worth of footage.

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:22.209
Sometimes it's a challenge when you have such a large amount of material

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:24.209
to not be overwhelmed or to know where to start.

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:26.209
So having a good plan, figuring out what your focus is,

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:28.209
that was the first step we needed to realize

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:31.209
what is the theme we want to focus on in these stories.

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:34.209
Not the tragedy of it, but the faith that was shown,

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.209
the resilience that the people had.

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:40.579
We would go through the footage and we would take screenshots

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:46.579
of some of these happy, laughing faces and print out those images

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:50.579
and then put them on backboards all around the room

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:54.579
so that we would keep our focus on the stories of the faith

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:57.579
and resilience that we wanted to emphasize.

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:05.139
The challenge with this particular video was that there was such an abundance

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.139
of faith strengthening and encouraging stories

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.139
that you didn't want to cut any of it out.

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.139
And yet, we don't have time to tell every single story.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.139
When we looked at the things that we posted around the room,

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.139
the pictures, the images of the people, the plans,

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.139
the storyboarded sequences, it was so encouraging

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.139
because these brothers and sisters,

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.139
they had literally lost everything.

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.139
And all they had were the muddy clothes on their back

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.139
and they were living dozens in the same kingdom hall.

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.139
And yet, they were happiest to be with smiling faces

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.139
and focusing on spiritual things.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:52.339
We had to decide which pieces we wanted to focus on

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.339
when everything was so powerful.

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:58.339
But when you watch the video,

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:02.339
at first you're not hearing a recognizable song or melody.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.339
You're just hearing these chords.

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:08.339
They do happen to be the chords that come from song number 60 in our book.

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:13.259
He will make you strong.

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:16.259
The risk factor in using the song is that

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:19.259
because people would recognize the song that they would get sidetracked

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.259
from what they're seeing and hearing in the story.

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:26.259
But in this case, it really seemed like the content of the song,

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:31.259
the message of the song, would really fit very well.

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:33.259
And so in experimenting with the music,

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:36.259
we realized that even when you strip away the melody,

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:41.259
just use the chords, which is what you hear at the very beginning of the video.

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:43.259
And then at some point,

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.259
we actually depart from that compositionally.

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:50.259
We do not stick strictly to the song throughout the music score.

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:53.259
But we borrow from it intermittently.

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:55.259
And that's because early on,

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:59.259
we're talking about the disaster itself, the tragedy itself.

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:01.259
So there are other musical needs.

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:04.259
So we depart from the song composition

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.259
and we develop differently for a time.

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:11.259
But later, when we're telling the part about our brothers and sisters,

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:15.259
surviving, working together, helping one another,

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:20.259
that's when we bring the song itself, Singers and All, back into the story.

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:25.259
We have an excellent recording chorus in our Philippines branch.

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:28.259
We had them audition soloists for us

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:45.120
from which we selected the female soloist that was used.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.120
In this case, it turned out to be a really good fit.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.120
Taking this story to a higher level than just, say, humanitarian efforts,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:09:04.179
it really gives the spiritual aspect of the help and the provision from Jehovah himself.

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:09.179
You may recall that in the video, there was a young girl, Cheryl and her brother.

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:12.179
The two of them lost their parents

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:16.179
and their other siblings during that terrible typhoon.

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:21.179
And we're happy to report that, first of all, very quickly after the typhoon,

00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:24.179
a family in that area where the evacuees were,

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:28.179
they took the two into their family and cared for them

00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:32.179
until such time as another family became available

00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:35.179
that is closer to where the branch office is.

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:38.179
Cheryl joined the auxiliary pioneer service in May

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:41.179
and her brother is making progress in studying the Bible.

00:09:41.179 --> 00:09:45.179
The brothers have really rallied to help these children

00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:48.179
to go on with their lives and to continue serving Jehovah.

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:51.179
It was really important that this video be done

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:54.179
because the brothers around the world needed to know

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:59.179
what had happened to their brothers and sisters in the Philippines.

00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:02.179
Typhoon Haiyan hit landfall in a country

00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:06.179
in which we have over 185,000 of our brothers and sisters.

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:08.179
The impact was great on them.

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:10.179
Their story had really needed to be told.

00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:23.629
We are a worldwide organization.

00:10:23.629 --> 00:10:26.629
We're a worldwide brotherhood of family.

00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:28.629
We love each other. We care for each other.

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:30.629
We need to know when there's a need like this

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:32.629
and what can be done to help.

00:10:32.629 --> 00:10:38.629
Whenever Jehovah's people demonstrate this kind of love in helping one another,

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:40.629
they really is Christianity in action.

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:43.629
This was a powerful story to tell.

00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:45.629
We know we're living in the last days

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:47.629
and tragedies like this happen.

00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:51.629
Many of us wonder how would I react if that happened to me

00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:54.629
and seeing the examples of faith of our brothers and sisters

00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:57.629
in the Philippines is so faith-strengthening

00:10:57.629 --> 00:11:00.629
because we see that even if you lose everything,

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:02.629
Jehovah always takes care of us.
