00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.459
Is it possible to survive the attack of a roaring lion?

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.779
Well now I did some just quick checking

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.980
on various wildlife websites.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.980
And here's what they say.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.699
Basically, they all give the same advice

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.260
if you're being attacked by a lion.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.260
They say hold your ground, never run or turn back.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.140
In fact, one website says a lion can run 50 miles per hour.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.500
So stand still.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.060
If you run, you will only die tired.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.659
Well, that's true.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.060
First Peter chapter five and verse nine

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.500
gives us exactly the same advice.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.820
It says take your stand against him.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.100
Well, in this case, not against a literal lion,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.740
but against that roaring lion Satan the devil

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.659
who is seeking to devour every single one of us.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.099
Our ability to stand firm when facing this lion,

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:13.099
to be able to oppose him, to refuse to be intimidated by him,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.859
to refuse to run away or turn back,

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.459
requires what the Apostle Peter next mentions there

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:22.980
in verse nine in Brother Crane,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.739
so nicely covered in his comment.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.700
We have to take our stand against him,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.780
firm in the faith.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.099
To be successful, we must have complete trust

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.859
and complete confidence in Jehovah.

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.019
Well, now in that regard, let's look at an example

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.140
of someone in Bible times who had

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.739
that kind of confidence in Jehovah.

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:51.019
This is in the days of King Jehashafat

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.260
when Judah was threatened by the combined forces

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.420
of Moab, Ammon, and the inhabitants

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.780
of the mountainous region of Seer.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.180
Now, let's begin by opening our Bibles

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.219
and reading 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and verse 12.

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.060
So here, Jehashafat is praying to Jehovah.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.060
He's pouring out his heart to him

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.860
and see what he says.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.860
Oh, our God, will you not execute judgment on them

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.340
for we are powerless before this large crowd

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.539
that is coming against us,

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.979
and we do not know what we should do,

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.020
but our eyes are toward you.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.860
Well, Jehashafat was facing the lion.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.780
He said to Jehovah, we don't know what to do,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.740
but Jehashafat had complete and total trust.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.659
He had firm faith in Jehovah.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.819
Well, what did Jehovah tell Jehashafat to do?

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.099
See verse 17.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.099
You will not need to fight this battle.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.180
Take your position.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.060
Does that sound familiar?

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.020
Take your position, stand still,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.939
and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.139
Oh, Judah and Jerusalem do not be afraid or be terrified.

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.780
Tomorrow, go out against them,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.900
and Jehovah will be with you.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.419
Well, what did Jehovah tell them to do?

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.699
He said, take a position,

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.979
in opposition to that military force, stand firm,

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.060
refuse to run away,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.139
and see the salvation that will come from Jehovah.

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.979
Well, in order to do that,

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.180
Jehashafat and the people with him

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.020
would need to have strong, firm, solid faith.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.539
Well, not to help the people,

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.979
look at what Jehashafat said to them

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.659
as they were getting ready for this battle in verse 20.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.860
You see just about middle of the verse.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.780
It says, Jehashafat stood up and said,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.780
listen to me, Oh, Judah,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.419
and you inhabitants of Jerusalem.

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.860
Put faith in Jehovah your God

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.740
so that you may be able to stand firm.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.259
Put faith in his prophets,

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.899
and you will be successful.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.180
Well, that's exactly what happened.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.420
See, with that kind of confidence in Jehovah,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.379
with that firm trust in him,

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:27.699
with that standing firm, what did Jehovah do?

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.420
Well, according to verses 22 and 23,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.259
you'll remember what happened.

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.579
The men of Ammon, Moab,

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:38.220
and the inhabitants of the mountainous region of Seer,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.300
they all went to striking down one another.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.860
And in verse 23 says,

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.939
and the Ammonites and the Moabites

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.860
turned against the inhabitants of the mountainous region

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.100
of Seer to destroy and annihilate them.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.019
And when they finished with the inhabitants of Seer,

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:57.339
they helped to destroy one another.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:03.339
Well, Jehovah had rewarded their firm faith in him.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.540
The weapons that had been formed against Jehashafat

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.339
and his people had no success.

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.779
Well, sometimes we think, of course,

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:17.899
that these kinds of situations only happened in Bible times,

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.660
but it's amazing to see how our brothers

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.939
in our modern day have had that same kind of faith

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.540
and have stood firm against the lion.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.300
Here's just a couple of experiences

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.899
that really touch my heart.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:36.060
Here's one about a brother named Pavel from Russia.

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.139
In 1958, Pavel was arrested for religious activities.

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.779
Accompanying me to the train, he says,

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.980
the officer with me said,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.860
look at your wife for the last time

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.779
because you will never see her again while there's the lion.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.620
I spent six months in solitary confinement before my trial.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.100
During interrogations, the investigators did everything

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.180
to undermine my faith.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.740
Sometimes violence was used.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.180
I begged Jehovah to give me the strength to stay firm,

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.300
but now look what happened.

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:17.220
During a routine interrogation,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.860
the investigator called me into his study

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.699
and he said, now we will show you what your organization

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.259
is doing, then you can see if it is God's work or not.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.540
Looking at me intently, he continued.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.660
This year, your convention in New York

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.660
was attended by 253,000 people in two stadiums.

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:43.180
The convention lasted eight days.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.540
The investigators screwed the table with photographs.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.100
In one of them, I saw happy delegates

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.579
and colorful native dress embracing one another.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.779
Another photo showed Brother Nor, giving a talk

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:57.860
and yet others showed the baptism.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.699
The investigator could not even imagine

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.300
what I was feeling at that moment.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.779
I felt that I was attending the convention

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:10.620
without ever having leaving the prison.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.459
I felt new strength flooding into me.

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:17.459
It was just what I needed.

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:21.540
And Jehovah generously blessed me in a special way.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.379
I was ready to endure further.

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:25.379
Isn't that amazing?

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:28.699
Here's another similar experience.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.459
1960, also in Russia, a large publicized trial

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:36.259
of Jehovah's Witnesses, about 300 persons

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:39.019
were present in the courtroom, including many

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:41.259
of our brothers and sisters.

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:45.100
Well, as the evidence against the brothers,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.259
the prosecutor decided to present a letter

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.660
from Nathan H. Nor.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.980
One of the brothers who attended the trial said this.

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:57.180
The prosecutor loudly began to read a letter

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.699
that had been intercepted by the KGB from Brother Nor

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:03.339
to the brothers in the Soviet Union.

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:06.379
For all of us witnesses present in the hall,

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:09.139
it was a wonderful gift from Jehovah.

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:11.540
The letter warmed our hearts.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.139
We heard wise counsel from the Bible

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:17.579
and encouragement to serve our fellow believers lovingly

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:20.899
and to stay faithful even under trials.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.459
The prosecutor read the letter from beginning

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:26.259
to the very end.

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:28.980
We listened with wrapped attention.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:34.240
It seemed to us that we were attending a convention.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.240
When our brothers, what additional lessons

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.960
do we learn from these two experiences?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.200
When we stand our ground against Satan, firm in the faith,

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:49.720
then Jehovah will do just what he promised

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:52.480
in 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse 10.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.840
Do you see what it says there?

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:57.320
But after you have suffered a little while,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.879
the God of all undeserved kindness

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:04.840
who called you to his everlasting glory and union with Christ

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.799
will himself finish your training.

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:12.120
He will make you firm, he will make you strong,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.080
he will firmly ground you.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.399
So, brothers, can we survive the attack

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.720
of a roaring lion?

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:23.200
Absolutely.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.519
With firm faith, let's stand fast

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:30.320
and see the salvation from Jehovah.
