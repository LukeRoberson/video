00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:08.419
Welcome to this special news update regarding our brothers in Venezuela.

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:15.800
As reported in the JW News section of JW.org in August 2017, our brothers in Venezuela

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.679
are enduring difficult economic conditions.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:25.280
Sadly, the overall situation continues to worsen.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.440
Basic needs like food and medicine are hard to obtain.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.399
And some crime is on the increase.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.600
Things are chaotic.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.439
Because we love our worldwide brotherhood, this difficult situation affects all of us.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:52.079
As Paul said at 1 Corinthians 1226, if one member suffers, all the other members suffer

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.960
with it.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.719
Or if a member is glorified, all the other members rejoice with it.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.879
No doubt you pray regularly for our brothers in Venezuela.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.920
Despite these difficult times, how are our brothers doing spiritually?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.879
We're sure you'll find the following report to be sobering and encouraging.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:23.280
Notice how despite these difficult times, our brothers in Venezuela are showing love

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.840
and faith.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.439
May this report motivate all of us to continue having unity of mind, fellow feeling,

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.959
brotherly affection and tender compassion as 1 Peter 3.8 says.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:02:02.099
It's amazing to see how far this situation has gone and it was still added.

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:09.539
So people in general have a lot of endurance and the brothers, they endure.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.060
They're still cheerful, they have to trust one another, they have to rely on one another.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.180
We gathered some statistics two months ago and we found out in only three years, 7,000

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.979
publishers.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:34.419
Among them, many elders, many pioneers have left the country because of the dangers.

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:40.979
They have all threatened, some had been kidnapped, let go and then they left the country.

00:02:40.979 --> 00:03:01.159
Family members have been killed and so on.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:08.639
One of the things we had to do and the local congregations, which most of them have quite

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:16.719
a few better light elders, is to move their meeting time on the weekdays to an earlier

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.719
hour.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.360
The brothers can go to the meeting with daylight and sometimes they can go home after the meeting

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.439
with some daylight.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.439
If you go to some congregations that are well to do, I've been to the place and you don't

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.560
see anyone at the meeting with their cell phones or tablets and I say, why is that?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.719
It's not because they're afraid to lose it, they just don't want to attract criminals

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:46.719
into the kingdom hall.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.560
It's a one tablet all might suffer.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.639
So you see they're learning to be street wise even more because the Venezuelans, you have

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:01.080
to be street wise for a long time ago in the past, but now it's getting worse.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.319
But the brotherhood in general, they don't complain, at least in my congregation, you have

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.919
to ask and you have to show real interest so the brothers and sisters can tell you what

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.599
they're going through.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.920
They knocked on the door and opened just a little crack and the young man, when he saw

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.920
me, opened the door wide and we talked, I asked him, have you read the Bible?

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.319
He said, oh, when I was in prison, I read it, read it a lot.

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.399
He probably said that to see my reaction.

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:41.199
Now we just kept talking and talking behind him was another young man, he had a pistol

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.399
in his hand.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.920
I saw that and I didn't react.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.759
He put the gun in his pocket and we kept talking for about 15, 20 minutes.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.920
When we went away, the brother that was with me, he was quite upset.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.240
He said, do you know who that was?

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.560
I said no.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.480
That was one of the gang leaders.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.759
He has killed a lot of people.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:08.879
I said, well, what I notice is that he's a human being just like the rest.

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.759
He needs the message.

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:21.319
We have noticed to the last few years an increase, not only in publishers, pioneers and who

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:29.319
are starting to pioneer, well, as usual, mostly sisters, but many brothers, many elders.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.519
They may have had a good job.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:37.480
They lost their job because the company closed down and left the country, so many brothers

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.279
have mentioned to me, well, I lost my job.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.279
I had no job.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:47.120
Now I can pioneer, so they start pioneering and I think that's very good and that helps

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.000
them to keep going.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.959
I'm sure the brothers are happy to see that everybody cares.

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:59.879
Everybody in the brotherhood worldwide and that the governing body is informed and doing

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:05.079
all they physically can to help us with their prayers.

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:10.079
So when you feel part of the worldwide brotherhood that you're not alone, that has

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:17.959
a calming effect on you and your confidence or faith in Jehovah's organization, as

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:22.360
a physical, visible organization grows.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.160
So we know we're part of something bigger than just a country.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:35.040
But this is put into the test how strongly we have faith in Bible principles.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.519
We think they work, but when they're put to the test, then you convince that they work.

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:43.720
And then I'm convinced I will come out of this stronger.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.439
And that's what James said, that endurance needs to go to work on each one of us.

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:56.480
So if you view it that way, then that gives you hope that this sad and hard and difficult

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.839
times will make this better.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:08.279
Nehemiah 810 says, do not be sad for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:12.959
So where is our strength in the joy of Jehovah?

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:19.920
I think we should always be positive, not negative, not concentrate on the negative.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:27.120
Like I quoted before Nehemiah 810, the joy of Jehovah, that's what we see among the brothers.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.199
The numbers came down because of the 7,000 that have left.

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:36.839
But the carnations keep reporting and the circuit overseas and the reports keep showing

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:42.279
us new people are still coming into the truth, many new ones.

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.519
So that's positive.

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:47.199
They're not paralyzed because of that.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:53.759
They keep focused on the kingdom, Jesus the King, and they keep going in that direction.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:08:00.000
Anytime anyone looks to the side and looks at the storm, he stops in his tracks.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.079
When he starts missing meetings, he starts thinking about his wallet, his money, his bank account.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:10.319
So that is not good.

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:20.769
Keep focused on the kingdom.

00:08:20.769 --> 00:08:26.730
We're proud of you, brothers and venezuela, for keeping focused on spiritual things and

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:31.850
maintaining a positive spirit during these difficult times.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:40.090
The reports show that of the 140,000 publishers in Venezuela, over 30,000 are regular pioneers,

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.490
and 9,000 are auxiliary pioneers.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:50.490
On average, publishers spend 15 hours in the ministry each month.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:55.730
They're conducting close to 200,000 Bible studies.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:01.169
To illustrate the spirit of our brothers in Venezuela, note these two comments from

00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:04.289
circuit overseers.

00:09:04.289 --> 00:09:09.330
Our brothers live in an area of extreme poverty and insecurity.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.730
Meeting attendance is excellent, although most of our brothers live far from the kingdom

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.690
hall and have to walk for more than an hour.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:22.769
The regularity in service is 100%.

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:30.049
Another circuit overseer reported, 50% of the publishers are regular pioneers.

00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:36.570
There are only two elders, but they are hardworking, humble, well-organized, and a good example

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.210
in the preaching and shepherding work.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:47.570
We're encouraged by the love and faith that you, brothers and venezuela, show.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:54.950
Please know that we love you all very much.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:00.110
We're going to hear more about our brothers in Venezuela in another special report that

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:05.149
will be released on Video On Demand on November 12, 2018.

00:10:05.149 --> 00:10:10.429
The video is entitled Surviving Trials in Venezuela.

00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:16.629
It's an interview with a couple from Venezuela who recently attended the 144th Class of

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:18.629
Gillian.

00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:23.710
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
