00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.479
Life is so unpredictable.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.479
Looking back, I never thought I'd be here.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.280
Still, I don't regret the choices I've made.

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:53.189
Although at times, I wasn't sure where they'd date me.

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:54.990
Hey Liz.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.789
Hey, Zach.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.189
What are you doing here?

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:00.090
I was just head and work.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.990
I was friendly though.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.489
I actually used to have a 15-minute.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:04.989
Hey, Meg.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.689
Hey.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:06.890
You guys both work here?

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.790
Yes, we do.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.290
Nice.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.790
Yes.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.489
Listen, if you have a couple of minutes,

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:13.189
can I buy you something to drink?

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.189
My treat.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.489
Anything?

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:18.739
Uh, um.

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:23.340
Well, okay.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.340
One Earl Grey coming up.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.340
Thank you very much.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.540
Chino with whipped cream.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.540
That sounds so much better.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.739
Uh, cheese.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:32.939
What I want.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.239
How do you work at a coffee shop and drink tea?

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.540
I just needed an after-school job.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.640
Meg had mentioned there was an opening here and I figured

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.939
it would be great for pioneering once I graduate.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:48.739
Pioneering?

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:49.340
Yeah.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.640
I didn't realize that's what you were planning on doing.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.939
How many times do we run into each other?

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.939
Whether it's school or at the King of Hall?

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.439
And this is the first time that we've actually

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.640
getting a chance to talk.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.340
Yeah.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.340
I know.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.739
I guess that's part of being the new guy, right?

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:05.340
Oh, come on.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.040
You're not that new.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.540
I don't know.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.340
I guess it still feels like that sometimes.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.840
Do you not like it here?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.240
No, it's not that I don't like it.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240
It's just...

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.740
It's totally different.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.139
Why did your family move?

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.340
My dad's opening up a restaurant not too far from here.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.639
So we moved to be closer.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.639
I don't have to give him a minute, Dad.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.639
He's not a witness, so.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.139
How does he feel about the truth?

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:40.039
I think his real concern is that I make time

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.439
for the business when I graduate.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.939
Is that what you want to do?

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.139
In the end, I think I want what most people want.

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.139
I have a job doing something that I like to do.

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.439
Make some money.

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.139
How about you?

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.539
I mean, besides pioneering.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.539
What plans do you have?

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.639
I've been wanting to take some classes.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.879
Oh, it's my dad.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.879
I'm the one sad.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.610
Hey, Dad.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.680
Yeah, I can be there in 15.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.509
Okay.

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.009
I'm sorry.

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:18.610
So then I let you go.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.409
My dad needs me at the restaurant.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.409
Totally understand.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.409
But I'll definitely see you in school, okay?

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:24.210
Yes.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.210
Okay.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.210
Thank you for my tea.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.210
You're welcome.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:39.319
See you later, Zach.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.520
Bye.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.520
I know what that was about.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.520
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520
No?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.520
She's new here.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.520
Mm-hmm.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.520
She's talking.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.520
Oh, she's just trying to be nice.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520
Mm-hmm.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
Trying to be nice.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.439
Got it.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.439
Fun.

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:04.370
What?

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.169
It seems like he likes you.

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.569
He seems nice.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.580
I don't even know him.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.780
Is it because he's not baptized?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.379
But he's not baptized?

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.180
I thought you knew that.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.379
And no, I just zoomed.

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.180
Well, that tells you something.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.379
He knows it's the truth.

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.579
And again, I can't even consider someone who's not baptized.

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:34.379
Blaze, not everyone is raising the truth like us.

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.449
Give him a chance.

00:04:37.449 --> 00:05:07.470
Try to be a little more understanding.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.569
Because everything OK?

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:11.769
It's been better.

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:13.569
Why was the coach yelling at you?

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.370
I told him I wasn't playing soccer anymore.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.370
He just went off.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.769
They were going to offer me a sports scholarship.

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:23.370
And now, I'm throwing my future away.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.370
Scholarship must be good.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.970
I used to play on the team of my old school.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.769
But my parents, my mom, she doesn't really

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:37.170
want me to play anymore.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.170
Can you tell the coach why you can't play?

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.569
Are you kidding?

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.370
You would never understand the whole religion thing?

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.170
Well, if it's any consolation, I think what you did today

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.259
was the right decision.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.259
Thanks.

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:59.660
But between you and me, I really want to play.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.060
No, I just feel torn sometimes.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.660
I can understand that.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.660
But being able to dedicate you to life to Jehovah,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.459
it's worth any sacrifice.

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:13.660
You mean like baptism?

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.259
Yeah, you have a date plan?

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.660
You know, with school wrapping up,

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.259
I've just been focused on helping my dad out.

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.860
I'm hoping maybe for the end of the year.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.259
But we'll see how it goes.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:26.860
Well, I think what you did today

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.000
was definitely a step in the right direction.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.680
Thanks.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.480
Yeah.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.879
I should probably go get changed.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:37.480
OK.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.480
I'll see you tonight.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.879
Tonight?

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:40.680
At the meeting?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.079
Oh, there you are.

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:43.879
Of course.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:44.879
Hey, man.

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:47.079
Oh, am I interrupting something?

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:49.079
No, I was just leaving.

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:49.879
I'll see you tonight.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:52.509
All right.

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.110
Hey, see you tonight.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.709
What's that about?

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:56.709
Our meeting.

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:00.110
Remember, I told you I'm becoming a Jehovah's Witness.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.910
I mean, I know you told me, but saying and doing

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.310
two different things, my friend.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.709
Well, I'm ready to do it.

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:07.709
Why now?

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:08.509
No.

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:10.910
Because a church girl?

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.709
No way.

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:13.110
I don't think so.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.509
What's that supposed to mean?

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:15.509
Come on.

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:16.910
Nothing against Liz, right?

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.110
But she's really religious.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.509
You?

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:22.709
Not so much.

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.110
Is that so?

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.509
I'm just telling you how I see it.

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:28.509
Well, start seeing it a little differently.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:30.110
I mean, if you say so.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.110
But look, I thought we had plans tonight.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.110
Well, plans.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.709
The game at Westbrook Park.

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:38.509
I have my meeting tonight.

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:39.910
Look, it's fine.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.910
I can find someone else, you know?

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.910
I got a bunch of best friends.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.709
Don't worry about me.

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:48.709
Stop, stop.

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:49.509
Count me in.

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:50.310
I'll be there.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.310
Yeah?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.310
Yeah.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.509
Cool.

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:54.110
Well, look, I got to go get changed.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.709
I'll see you tonight.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:08:02.949
I'll see you tonight.

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:05.149
Liz, I can't make it tonight.

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:06.550
Thanks for the talk.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.149
Let's chat tomorrow, OK?

00:08:08.149 --> 00:09:55.230
That sounds good.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.429
Liz, what do you think about that?

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.830
Is that something you can do?

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.830
Liz?

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.629
Liz, where'd you go?

00:10:02.629 --> 00:10:06.029
You weren't even listening to our conversation, huh?

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:07.230
I know, I'm sorry.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.830
Is everything OK?

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:16.029
Actually, there's something I want to tell you.

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:18.830
I'm not quite sure how to say it.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.490
OK, we're listening.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.059
There's someone I'm interested in.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:29.659
Interested in?

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:32.460
Someone I'd like to date.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.059
You're only 17.

00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:36.259
I'm turning 18 the next month.

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:40.889
That's not the point.

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:42.289
What is the point?

00:10:42.289 --> 00:10:44.889
You know how your mom and I feel about you even

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:46.889
thinking about dating so young.

00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:49.799
Who are we talking about?

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:50.799
Zach.

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:52.000
Zach Tanner?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Dad, if this is about him not being baptized.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.200
Whoa, yes, this is exactly about him not being baptized.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.200
And even if he was, you're both still too young.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.200
We're not that young.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.600
We're graduating soon.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.600
Liz, neither one of you is ready for marriage right now.

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:12.200
Can you honestly see Zach as being your spiritual head?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:20.639
I never thought I'd feel like this.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.240
Liz, we understand.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.840
We're not against you finding someone

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.639
that's going to make you happy when they were not.

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:28.039
But the problem is, darling,

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:31.639
that when you start developing strong feelings for someone

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:38.519
early on, it is so hard to see their potential flaws.

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:39.720
But I thought when you're married,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.919
you're supposed to overlook flaws.

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:43.720
That's true.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.720
But the time to keep your eyes open to potential spiritual

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:53.320
problems is way before marriage, not afterwards.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.279
I know.

00:11:56.279 --> 00:12:03.279
It's just when I see other girls with their boyfriends.

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:05.480
I want that too.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.789
Liz, we understand.

00:12:08.789 --> 00:12:15.590
But Zach hasn't even taken the first step towards baptism yet.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.190
Neither one of you are ready for dating.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:39.289
I'm sorry, but there's no way your mom and I can approve of this.

00:12:39.289 --> 00:12:43.440
I think it's time to warm you up.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.240
Yeah, man.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:51.830
So what's up?

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.830
Well, haven't you been responding to any of my texts?

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.830
I know.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.830
I'm sorry.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:04.279
You remember how you told me you felt

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:09.879
when a coach wanted you to play, but you knew you couldn't?

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:11.879
When I told him I felt torn?

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:12.879
Yeah.

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:14.879
What does that have to do with?

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:19.879
My parents feel like we're too young to get into a relationship.

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:21.279
Your parents, Liz?

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:23.279
You're almost 18.

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:26.279
No, I know.

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:27.679
It's not just that.

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:29.879
So we had something here.

00:13:29.879 --> 00:13:36.379
Don't let them ruin this for us.

00:13:36.379 --> 00:13:38.779
I feel like I have my goals.

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:42.379
And I don't think you're on the same page.

00:13:42.379 --> 00:13:44.179
What kind of goals are you talking about?

00:13:44.179 --> 00:13:45.179
I'm hearing.

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:47.379
Maybe in the future of Angelizer School.

00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:48.379
Oh, come on.

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:50.379
I'm not opposed to any of that.

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:53.850
You're not for it, either.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.450
I admit sometimes I miss meetings, and I should be out in service more.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.450
I know that.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.450
But I'll turn things around.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:06.200
When?

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.799
That's why I have you.

00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:08.799
You can help me.

00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:13.070
Help me, Zach.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:17.210
Come on, Liz.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:26.019
You can't.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:27.019
Where you won't.

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:37.159
I was hoping you weren't going to be like this.

00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:38.159
Be like one.

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:40.559
I know I have things to work on.

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:43.559
Just allow you to give me a little bit more time before you just write me off.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:45.559
I'm not writing you off.

00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:46.759
Really?

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:51.169
So you're saying you'd give us another chance?

00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:52.169
Exactly.

00:14:52.169 --> 00:14:53.169
You know what, though?

00:14:53.169 --> 00:15:00.730
I can never be with someone that expects perfection.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:25.379
Well, neither was this.

00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:26.980
What are you doing here?

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.379
I'm just walking, Jasper.

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:30.379
What are you doing?

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:33.379
I'm actually waiting for a shipment for my dad's restaurant, so.

00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:34.179
How nice.

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:38.279
I'm hoping it's your soon.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.879
I know we've talked enough, but.

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:45.879
I don't think I really had a chance to tell you how sorry I am that things didn't work out with you and Liz.

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:50.000
She really liked you.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.399
Thanks, I guess.

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.399
You know, maybe things can still work out.

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:58.399
Yeah, I don't think so.

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:00.600
To be honest, it's been months now.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.200
And you know what?

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.399
We just weren't right for each other.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.600
Really?

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.200
Yeah.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.399
I mean, she's the type of girl that was expecting me to be perfect.

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:14.799
And on top of that, she didn't even really know how she fell.

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:15.600
I know.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.799
I told her the same thing.

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:20.000
You did?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.200
Yeah.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.639
What else did you tell her if you don't mind me asking?

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:30.039
Well, that you're a great guy.

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:37.179
And she's crazy for not giving you a chance.

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.779
I didn't realize that's how you fell.

00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:42.379
No.

00:16:42.379 --> 00:16:44.179
No, I didn't mean it that way.

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:46.379
What I meant to say is thank you.

00:16:46.379 --> 00:16:49.379
Seriously, I appreciate that.

00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:54.779
Well, I should probably take Jasper for a walk because he gets really cranky.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:57.980
I don't want that to happen, so I'll let you go.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.980
All right, I'll see you around.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.980
All right, bye.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:39.880
You'll make, you got a box.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:47.440
Megan saw this and thought Jasper might like it.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.039
And then I saw this and thought you might like it.

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.039
Let me know.

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:53.039
Zach.

00:17:53.039 --> 00:18:10.230
Something to eat.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:20.230
Another text message?

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:24.109
It is.

00:18:24.109 --> 00:18:26.109
Megan, are you sure about this?

00:18:26.109 --> 00:18:28.109
I thought you were over Zach.

00:18:28.109 --> 00:18:29.109
I am.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.109
I am.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.109
That's not what I'm saying.

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:34.109
So, what are you saying?

00:18:34.109 --> 00:18:38.109
Are you sure about getting into something with him?

00:18:38.109 --> 00:18:41.109
His spirituality is, Liz.

00:18:41.109 --> 00:18:43.109
You and I, we see things differently.

00:18:43.109 --> 00:18:46.109
I don't expect him to be perfect.

00:18:47.109 --> 00:18:49.109
Don't you see the potential problems?

00:18:49.109 --> 00:18:50.109
No, I don't.

00:18:50.109 --> 00:18:52.109
I just see a lot of good.

00:18:52.109 --> 00:18:58.690
And besides, I can change him.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.690
Megan, he's not even baptized yet.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.690
Zach is not a spiritually mature person.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.690
The problems come up.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.690
You're going to want someone who's solid in it.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.690
I don't want to argue.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.690
Okay.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.690
Why can't you just be happy for me?

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.690
I don't want you to be happy.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:15.690
Then just drop it.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:22.970
Fine.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:23.970
I won't bring it up again.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:30.599
Listen, I have to take this.

00:19:30.599 --> 00:19:33.599
I appreciate concern, but...

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:34.599
This...

00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:36.599
This is my decision.

00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:37.599
I know.

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:39.599
Just be sure it's the right one.

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:47.750
Hey, Zach, how are you?

00:19:47.750 --> 00:20:02.039
I've been very uncomfortable before.

00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:03.039
I need a dress.

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.039
All right.

00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:06.039
Get in safely.

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:11.259
Can I grab my jacket?

00:20:11.259 --> 00:20:13.259
I left it on the counter.

00:20:13.259 --> 00:20:14.259
Yeah.

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:15.259
Just be quiet.

00:20:15.259 --> 00:20:20.750
Here it is.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.750
A little late, isn't it?

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.750
Dad, you scared me.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:26.750
I'm sorry, Gavin.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:27.750
It's my fault.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.750
I just lost your time.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.750
Hey, Mom.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.750
Oh, how was it?

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.750
Oh, it was so much fun.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.750
I should probably get going, though.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.750
Oh, no, no.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.750
Stay.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.750
Want to hear about tonight.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.750
No, wait.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.750
I should probably go.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.750
Well, take someone to get home, okay?

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.750
That reminds me.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:41.750
I want to show you something online.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:47.359
Really?

00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:48.359
Yeah.

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:51.559
I love the details.

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:53.559
It's going to look so beautiful on you.

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:54.559
Oh, thanks, Mom.

00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:56.559
Oh, you're such a beautiful couple.

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:58.559
I want to go to your dad.

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:05.230
Okay.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.230
Hey, dad, can you come inside?

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.230
I want to show you something real quick.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.230
Yeah.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.230
I'll be in in a minute.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:10.230
Okay.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:17.119
Actually, Megan, come sit with me for a second.

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:18.119
Is everything okay?

00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:19.119
Yeah.

00:21:19.119 --> 00:21:21.119
I wanted to ask you a question.

00:21:21.119 --> 00:21:22.119
Okay.

00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:24.119
What is it you see in Zach?

00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:26.119
He's so sweet.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.119
He's charming.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.119
He's funny.

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:30.119
What else?

00:21:30.119 --> 00:21:32.119
Do you love about him?

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:33.119
I don't know.

00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:34.119
He makes me happy.

00:21:34.119 --> 00:21:36.119
But, Megan, why?

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:38.119
What are those feelings based on?

00:21:38.119 --> 00:21:40.119
Dad, you're starting to sound like Liz.

00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:41.119
Zach isn't bad.

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:43.119
I'm not saying Zach is bad.

00:21:43.119 --> 00:21:45.119
I give him a lot of credit.

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:47.119
He was raised in a religiously divided household.

00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:48.119
Exactly.

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:51.119
However, Zach's been studying for years.

00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:53.119
You have to be patient.

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:56.119
He's going to get baptized and then he's going to start reaching out.

00:21:56.119 --> 00:22:00.119
Are you basing that off of his actions or his promises?

00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:01.119
No disrespect, Dad.

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:03.119
But when it comes to reaching out,

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:05.119
you're not exactly the stellar example either.

00:22:06.119 --> 00:22:09.460
You're right.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.460
And maybe that's what's bothering me.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.460
Don't you think you're overreacting?

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.460
I'm besides Dad.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.460
I don't want to be single for the rest of my life.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.460
I'm not saying stay single forever.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.460
I'm saying, give it some time.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.460
You get one shot to choose your marriage mate.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.460
The choice is yours.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.460
But so are the consequences.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.460
I'm making the right choice.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.460
You just can't be happy for me.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:45.750
Megan of the Son of Man will be.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.750
For as they were in those days before the flood,

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:49.750
eating and drinking.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:55.720
This is exactly what I was taught on plans.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:20.440
I need to talk to you.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.440
Yeah, let me just throw on a shirt.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.440
I'll be right out.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.710
Meg.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.630
Can you just tell me you love me?

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.630
I love you.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:33.630
Really?

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.630
What's wrong? What's going on?

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.630
You weren't at the meeting again last night.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.630
Is that what this is about?

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.630
I was exhausted, okay?

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.630
My dad said...

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:44.630
Your dad?

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.630
Is that what this is all coming from?

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.630
He is only concerned.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:50.630
I know.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.630
This is the truth.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.630
There's always going to be people telling you what to do

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.630
and how to feel.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.630
But trust your feelings.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.630
And trust me.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.630
What if there's just more?

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:04.630
Before you say another word.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.630
I'll be right back, okay?

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:20.319
I know people are going to think whatever they want to think.

00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:26.640
But the last person that I want to be worried is you.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.640
I was going to wait.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:33.079
But there's a reason why I'm working so much.

00:24:33.079 --> 00:24:36.450
And I want you to know that.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:42.450
Which is why I want to ask you...

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:46.920
Will you marry me?

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.920
Yes, I will.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.619
Can I put it on?

00:24:51.619 --> 00:24:52.619
Yes.

00:24:52.619 --> 00:25:09.069
I just wish we didn't have to worry about what everybody else got.

00:25:10.069 --> 00:25:12.069
That we can just be together.

00:25:12.069 --> 00:25:15.569
And not worry about that.

00:25:15.569 --> 00:25:17.569
You mean... a lope?

00:25:17.569 --> 00:25:26.549
So why don't we?

00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:27.549
Okay.

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:30.990
Yeah?

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:41.690
Priscilla, it's Liz.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.690
Oh, Liz, how nice to see you.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:44.690
Oh, good to see you.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.690
I miss you.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:46.690
I miss you.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.690
I forgot your dish, sir.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.690
Oh, don't worry about that.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.690
I'd like to sit and visit for a few minutes.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.690
I would love to.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.690
We were having a cup of tea.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.690
I wonder if you'd like to join us.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.690
I would love some tea.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.690
Oh, good, good.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.690
A little spot of tea, as the British say.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.690
To revive you after your shopping expedition.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.690
My steering wheel is shopping.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.690
Thank you, Priscilla.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.690
So how's things going with you?

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:16.059
Pretty good, I guess.

00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:18.059
You seem a little sad.

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:20.059
I don't know.

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:25.940
You feel like talking about it?

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.940
I don't think it would help.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.940
You know you can talk to us.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.759
Please.

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:38.140
Well, last year I was interested in someone

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.140
but had to end it.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.140
What was that?

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.140
Zach Taylor?

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.140
Oh, yes.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.140
Oh, huh.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.140
Well, not long after it was over, he started dating Megan.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.140
And I don't regret the decision.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.140
I know I was way too young.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:59.140
But sometimes I just wonder if I'll ever feel like that

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.140
about someone else again.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.140
Oh, of course you will, Liz.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.140
Do you hope it created our hearts to heal?

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.140
And besides, it's not always a failure

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.140
when a romance doesn't work out.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.140
Sometimes it's for the best.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.799
Zach is a bit of a high risk.

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:20.799
Yeah, a lot of people felt that way.

00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:23.799
I don't know though, they seem really happy.

00:27:23.799 --> 00:27:26.799
It takes time to reveal the inner person,

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:29.799
the secret person of the heart.

00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:33.799
Well, how do you get to know the inner person?

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:37.799
Well, you have to hold back a little bit emotionally

00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:39.799
until you're sure that you're going to bring out

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:42.799
the best in each other.

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:46.799
It seems like everyone's found someone but me.

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:49.799
Enjoy your singleness while you have it.

00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:50.799
We did.

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:53.799
And then if that special someone comes along,

00:27:53.799 --> 00:28:45.829
you'll get to start a whole new chapter in your life.

00:28:45.829 --> 00:28:50.380
I get to one.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.380
I'm always hiding behind the camera, so this doesn't matter.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.380
It's alright.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.559
Liz, I was so glad to meet you.

00:28:57.559 --> 00:28:58.559
The wedding was gorgeous.

00:28:58.559 --> 00:28:59.559
Thank you.

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:01.559
Oh wait, John, can you get a picture of this a two of us?

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:02.559
Yeah, sure.

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:03.559
What happened to you?

00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:04.559
Sure.

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:05.559
Oh, nothing.

00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:07.559
Don't worry about it.

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:08.559
How do you want this picture?

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:12.000
Just like this is fine.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
There it is.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Oh, Liz, I love it.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Looks great.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Thank you, John.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
So, your name is Liz.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I'm sorry, I introduced you Liz.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
This is John, our photographer.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
There's David.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
I'll catch you guys later.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Okay.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Again.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
I'm really sorry.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
It's okay, it's just a shirt.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
It's really just a mess, honestly.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
And I can go buy new stuff.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Thank you.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
You're welcome, my friends.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.960
Did you know David and Olivia from Before The Wedding?

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960
I did.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.960
David and I sort of grew up together.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.960
We actually pioneered together.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.960
I came back a couple weeks ago for a visit.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.960
He found out that I do photography and asked if I'd handle the wedding.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.960
You are.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.960
Here I am.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.960
I didn't drink spilled on you.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.960
Yeah.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960
It's a show.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.960
You want Olivia?

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.960
You two go way back?

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.960
Well, you went to find your school together.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.960
They're friends ever since.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.960
When did you go?

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960
John, can we get a quick picture?

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.960
Oh.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.960
I'm sorry, I've got to get a picture of the cake before they cut it.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.960
It's pretty good that way.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.960
It's nice meeting you Liz.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.960
Nice meeting you too.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.960
Bye.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:27.559
Okay, bye.

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.559
With this ring, I V-Wed.

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:32.559
With this ring, I V-Wed.

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:37.519
It is my great pleasure to pronounce you husband and wife.

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:39.519
And to kiss your bride.

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:40.519
She takes after her mom.

00:30:40.519 --> 00:32:14.519
It's crazy how time has gone by so fast.

00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:15.519
I know.

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:16.519
What are you doing here?

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:18.519
We moved back.

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:19.519
What?

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:20.519
Yeah.

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:21.519
Why?

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:22.519
Tell her.

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:25.519
My dad's opening up a second restaurant in the city.

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:27.519
And he went back to rent it.

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:28.519
That's great.

00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:30.519
Yeah, the commute was killing me.

00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:32.519
So it just made sense.

00:32:32.519 --> 00:32:33.519
Well, that's exciting.

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:36.519
So we actually hired on Rod.

00:32:36.519 --> 00:32:39.519
Yeah, you're a soccer buddy from high school, right?

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:40.519
Yeah.

00:32:40.519 --> 00:32:41.519
Oh, that reminds me.

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:43.519
You have to come check out our law.

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:44.519
We just furnished it.

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:45.519
Yeah.

00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:47.519
I'll be in debt for years over that.

00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:48.519
Oh, come on.

00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:49.519
I'm worth it.

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:50.519
Of course you are.

00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:51.519
I'd love to see it.

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:57.339
So what are you still doing here?

00:32:57.339 --> 00:32:58.339
What do you mean?

00:32:58.339 --> 00:33:01.339
Well, no, just...

00:33:01.339 --> 00:33:04.339
I just thought you'd be doing something else by now.

00:33:04.339 --> 00:33:05.339
Hey, baby.

00:33:05.339 --> 00:33:08.339
We better go if we're going to get the show.

00:33:08.339 --> 00:33:11.339
Yeah, we actually have to drop Christine off at my parents.

00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:12.339
So, yeah.

00:33:12.339 --> 00:33:14.339
Really, it was so good seeing you.

00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:15.339
Who's good to see you, too?

00:33:15.339 --> 00:33:17.339
I'm surprised you remembered.

00:33:17.339 --> 00:33:18.339
Uh, yeah.

00:33:18.339 --> 00:34:25.070
I kind of hard to figure that.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.070
You're just staying.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.070
I loved on your shirt.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:28.070
I felt terrible.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.070
It is.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.070
I've dyed the whole shirt red since then.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.070
It's good to see you again.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.070
You, too.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:38.010
Are you back here for a visit?

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.010
No, I'm moved.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:42.699
Really?

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:43.699
Yeah.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:44.699
It's been a while.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:46.699
Really?

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:47.699
Yeah, it's been about six months.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:48.699
Nice.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:51.699
So, have you been here before?

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.699
No, this is my first time.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:55.699
You?

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:56.699
Oh, no.

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:59.699
I tend to stop by here a lot in my way home.

00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:02.699
I really love photography.

00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:05.699
I saw David and Olivia's wedding pictures.

00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:06.699
They came out so beautiful.

00:35:06.699 --> 00:35:07.699
Thanks.

00:35:07.699 --> 00:35:08.699
Did a great job.

00:35:08.699 --> 00:35:09.699
Thank you.

00:35:09.699 --> 00:35:13.699
Honestly, though, shooting wedding photos wasn't my first choice.

00:35:14.699 --> 00:35:16.699
You paid us the bells.

00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:19.699
What was your first choice?

00:35:19.699 --> 00:35:21.699
Something more like this here.

00:35:21.699 --> 00:35:27.239
Let me show you.

00:35:27.239 --> 00:35:28.239
I like this one.

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:29.239
I am?

00:35:29.239 --> 00:35:31.239
It's very different from the rest here.

00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:32.239
Really?

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:33.239
Why?

00:35:33.239 --> 00:35:37.940
Whatever they are.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.940
Time has moved on, but not their love.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:51.360
It's still strong.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.360
What are you thinking?

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:58.730
I was just thinking most pictures capture a moment in time.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:04.320
This one captures a whole lifetime in a moment.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:09.170
This one says to me at least.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:10.170
Oh.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:15.170
I just never thought about it like that before.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:20.679
You know, I think the photographer would agree with you.

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:24.300
Who is he?

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.300
Oh.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.300
Nobody important.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.300
Let me show you this one over here.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:39.480
Well, thanks.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.480
Let me show you around.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.480
That was really nice.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.480
I'm glad.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.480
So, is this it?

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480
Let's picture you tell me about?

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.480
Yeah.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.480
It seems really sad.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.170
Yeah.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.170
I guess I was having a moment.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:37:03.170
You ever make a decision that you know was right.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:06.170
But it still hurts anyways.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.170
Absolutely.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:12.170
A couple of years ago, my little brother was since fellowship.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.170
So, we had a sub-associating.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:17.170
It was the right thing to do, of course.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.170
But I was so painful.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:23.170
First Peter 5.7 has always helped me.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.170
Do you hope it cares for us?

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:32.309
So, we're never really alone.

00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:33.309
Nope.

00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:35.309
It's my mom.

00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:37.309
I told her I was going straight home.

00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:38.309
Yeah, I let you go.

00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:40.309
But it is getting kind of cold.

00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:41.309
Let's take my jacket.

00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:43.309
I don't know.

00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:44.309
Nope.

00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:51.480
I insist.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.480
It's a little big, but it'll work.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.480
Thank you.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.480
How will I get it back to you?

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.480
I still have a talk at your congregation coming up.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.480
So, let's get it then.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.480
Bye, John.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:33.679
Bye this.

00:38:33.679 --> 00:38:34.679
My last question.

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.679
Why should somebody come to Luna?

00:38:36.679 --> 00:38:38.679
Now, what would you say to your prospective customers?

00:38:38.679 --> 00:38:40.679
It's a very good question.

00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:43.679
Our selections are beautifully conceived.

00:38:43.679 --> 00:38:45.679
They're elegantly presented.

00:38:45.679 --> 00:38:47.679
And they're served in this captivating atmosphere.

00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:49.679
But they shouldn't take my word for it.

00:38:49.679 --> 00:38:51.679
They should come and see it for themselves.

00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:53.679
Yeah, I think that she was just about to do it.

00:38:53.679 --> 00:38:54.679
It wasn't so bad.

00:38:54.679 --> 00:38:55.679
All right.

00:38:55.679 --> 00:38:56.679
Thanks, Joe.

00:38:56.679 --> 00:38:57.679
Oh, no problem.

00:38:57.679 --> 00:38:59.679
Yeah, and just tell Mr. Tanner that I'm sorry

00:38:59.679 --> 00:39:01.679
he couldn't make it for the interview.

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:02.679
Yeah.

00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:04.679
I'll be sure to tell him.

00:39:04.679 --> 00:39:05.679
All right.

00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:06.679
You have a good one.

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:21.369
Take care now.

00:39:21.369 --> 00:39:23.369
Well, you're here early.

00:39:23.369 --> 00:39:24.369
Hey, Zach.

00:39:24.369 --> 00:39:26.369
I need to talk to you.

00:39:26.369 --> 00:39:27.369
You got a second?

00:39:27.369 --> 00:39:28.369
Actually, I don't.

00:39:28.369 --> 00:39:29.369
I have a bunch of things.

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:30.369
It's really important.

00:39:30.369 --> 00:39:33.159
Just a couple of minutes.

00:39:33.159 --> 00:39:38.679
All right.

00:39:38.679 --> 00:39:41.679
So, how's Megan?

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:42.679
She's good?

00:39:42.679 --> 00:39:43.679
Yeah.

00:39:43.679 --> 00:39:45.679
She happy?

00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:47.679
She's happy spending my money.

00:39:47.679 --> 00:39:48.679
Ah, see?

00:39:48.679 --> 00:39:50.679
That's why I stayed single.

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:53.679
Yeah, she's done the same.

00:39:53.679 --> 00:39:54.679
Hey, listen.

00:39:54.679 --> 00:39:56.679
Here's my real question.

00:39:56.679 --> 00:39:58.679
What happened last night?

00:39:58.679 --> 00:40:01.989
What are you talking about?

00:40:01.989 --> 00:40:02.989
Last night.

00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:04.989
You said you were going to be here for the magazine interview.

00:40:04.989 --> 00:40:05.989
I'm totally sorry.

00:40:05.989 --> 00:40:07.989
I forgot.

00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:09.989
Were you able to take care of it, though?

00:40:09.989 --> 00:40:10.989
You mean did I?

00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:11.989
Did I cover for you?

00:40:11.989 --> 00:40:12.989
Yeah, Zach.

00:40:12.989 --> 00:40:13.989
I covered for you.

00:40:13.989 --> 00:40:14.989
Apparently, that's what I do now.

00:40:14.989 --> 00:40:15.989
I covered for you.

00:40:15.989 --> 00:40:16.989
Come on.

00:40:16.989 --> 00:40:17.989
No, you don't.

00:40:17.989 --> 00:40:19.989
I had to go to my meeting last night.

00:40:19.989 --> 00:40:21.989
I haven't gone in months.

00:40:21.989 --> 00:40:23.989
Megan won't stop nagging me about it.

00:40:23.989 --> 00:40:25.989
I'm cool with all of them.

00:40:25.989 --> 00:40:26.989
You know, to each his own.

00:40:26.989 --> 00:40:27.989
And that's your thing.

00:40:27.989 --> 00:40:30.989
But you have to understand that the business is picking up.

00:40:30.989 --> 00:40:32.989
We need to know you're going to be there.

00:40:32.989 --> 00:40:33.989
I'm here now, aren't I?

00:40:33.989 --> 00:40:35.989
You know, look.

00:40:35.989 --> 00:40:37.989
Our busiest time isn't now.

00:40:37.989 --> 00:40:38.989
It's when.

00:40:38.989 --> 00:40:40.989
Evening's in weekends.

00:40:40.989 --> 00:40:41.989
You know that.

00:40:41.989 --> 00:40:44.989
When you hired me, you said we were going to work as a team, right?

00:40:44.989 --> 00:40:45.989
Yeah.

00:40:45.989 --> 00:40:46.989
I did.

00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:47.989
I know.

00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:50.989
But the last time I checked, a team met more than one person.

00:40:50.989 --> 00:40:52.989
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:40:52.989 --> 00:40:54.989
Look.

00:40:54.989 --> 00:40:56.989
We're not kids anymore.

00:40:56.989 --> 00:40:58.989
You know, this is the real world.

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.989
And the business doesn't run itself.

00:41:00.989 --> 00:41:01.989
You know that.

00:41:01.989 --> 00:41:02.989
So, what do you want from me?

00:41:02.989 --> 00:41:04.989
I want to know you're going to be there.

00:41:04.989 --> 00:41:07.989
I'd like to know I could depend on you.

00:41:07.989 --> 00:41:08.989
You can, okay?

00:41:08.989 --> 00:41:11.989
I promise I'll make this my priority.

00:41:11.989 --> 00:41:12.989
Priority.

00:41:12.989 --> 00:41:14.989
Okay.

00:41:14.989 --> 00:41:15.989
We'll see.

00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:40.769
Long day?

00:41:40.769 --> 00:41:42.769
Yeah, it was.

00:41:42.769 --> 00:41:44.769
You've had a lot of those lately, huh?

00:41:44.769 --> 00:41:48.690
It's busy and business needs me.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.690
I know.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:54.690
It just seems like the business comes before a lot of things lately.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.690
Meetings.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:58.690
Our marriage.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:01.690
Look, it doesn't exactly look like you're suffering.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.690
What do you want from me, Meg?

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:10.039
I want Christina's father.

00:42:10.039 --> 00:42:11.039
I want my husband.

00:42:11.039 --> 00:42:13.039
I want a spiritual man.

00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:19.280
Can't you see that I'm doing the best that I can?

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.280
I'm trying.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.650
If you can't see that, then I don't know what to say.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:27.650
You know, I have work to do.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:43:15.059
You have so many kids in your congregation.

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:17.059
You're talking today was perfect for them.

00:43:17.059 --> 00:43:18.059
Oh, thank you.

00:43:18.059 --> 00:43:20.059
They love the compass illustrations.

00:43:20.059 --> 00:43:22.059
They seem really interested in kids.

00:43:22.059 --> 00:43:24.059
There's a reason for that.

00:43:24.059 --> 00:43:27.400
Oh, your brother?

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.400
Yeah.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:34.400
So, with kids, I like to try to reach them while they're still time.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.400
Liz, I'm sorry.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.400
I promised him I'm showing the compass before I left.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.400
Oh, sure.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400
Can you just give me one minute?

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.400
I'll be right back.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.469
Yeah, no problem.

00:43:44.469 --> 00:43:45.469
Pretty cute, huh?

00:43:45.469 --> 00:43:46.469
Yeah.

00:43:46.469 --> 00:43:48.469
He seems like a really nice person.

00:43:48.469 --> 00:43:49.469
You know, he really is.

00:43:49.469 --> 00:43:51.469
We've known his family for years.

00:43:51.469 --> 00:43:54.469
I have to say the one thing I really admire about him.

00:43:54.469 --> 00:43:58.469
He never gets distracted by all these offers that come along.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.469
What offers?

00:43:59.469 --> 00:44:03.469
Well, you know, he has his work on display in these galleries

00:44:03.469 --> 00:44:04.469
and magazines.

00:44:04.469 --> 00:44:07.469
They all want him to be their principal photographer.

00:44:07.469 --> 00:44:08.469
Really?

00:44:08.469 --> 00:44:09.469
Yeah.

00:44:09.469 --> 00:44:12.469
He turns him down, though.

00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:14.469
He doesn't want to be away from the congregation.

00:44:14.469 --> 00:44:19.000
You know, you can see how much he loves his work.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
He's so focused, spiritually.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
He's a good brother.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Sounds like it.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Yeah, it's too bad he's leaving.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Wait, leaving?

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Well, that's what I heard.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.119
I guess he's going back to Oregon to go home.

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:41.119
Hey, my ride is here, so I gotta get going.

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:42.119
I'll talk to you later, okay?

00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:43.119
Bye, Jane.

00:44:43.119 --> 00:45:50.840
You by yourself?

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:51.840
Yeah.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.840
I just needed a break, so I got a babysitter.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.699
Oh, okay.

00:45:58.699 --> 00:45:59.699
I can get you anything.

00:45:59.699 --> 00:46:00.699
Let me know, okay?

00:46:00.699 --> 00:46:05.599
Thanks.

00:46:05.599 --> 00:46:11.639
So you still drinking tea?

00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:13.639
It's nice to see some things haven't changed.

00:46:13.639 --> 00:46:18.679
Megan.

00:46:18.679 --> 00:46:19.679
Are you okay?

00:46:19.679 --> 00:46:21.679
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:46:21.679 --> 00:46:22.679
I'm fine.

00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:24.679
Are you sure?

00:46:24.679 --> 00:46:30.610
It seems like something's wrong.

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:32.610
Zach moved out.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:37.840
Oh, Megan.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:44.949
It's just for a couple days, but we had a really bad fight.

00:46:44.949 --> 00:46:47.949
Nothing is what I expected it to be.

00:46:47.949 --> 00:46:50.949
Megan, I'm sure it's not that bad.

00:46:50.949 --> 00:46:52.949
It's worse.

00:46:52.949 --> 00:47:00.030
At first, everything was great.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:04.030
But slowly, everything just started to fall apart.

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.030
Oh, Megan, have you tried talking to him?

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:10.030
You'd have to be home first.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.030
He's never home.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:16.949
Maybe the alter's gone out.

00:47:16.949 --> 00:47:17.949
I've tried.

00:47:17.949 --> 00:47:28.010
He won't even meet me.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:29.010
Don't, okay?

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:30.010
Don't, don't what?

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.010
I don't need your pity.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:34.010
Oh, Megan, that's not what I meant.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.010
I see it on your face.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:38.010
I see it on everyone's face.

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:41.519
Especially my dad.

00:47:41.519 --> 00:47:45.280
I'm doing here to go.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.280
Megan, look at us.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.280
We lead such different lives.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.809
You would never understand.

00:47:55.809 --> 00:47:58.809
I hope I can help you fix this.

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:46.880
I used to be italistic, but now I'm just realistic.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.880
Yeah, I went home to help out my parents for a couple weeks.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:50.880
Why?

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.280
No reason.

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.280
What crew do you want?

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.280
Oh, finishes.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.559
Sounds exciting.

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:03.559
I don't know what it means either.

00:49:03.559 --> 00:49:04.559
You?

00:49:04.559 --> 00:49:05.559
I want an electrical.

00:49:05.559 --> 00:49:06.559
Ah.

00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.559
Yeah, that was exciting.

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:09.559
The lines.

00:49:09.559 --> 00:49:11.559
Yeah.

00:49:11.559 --> 00:49:14.559
It's really good to see you again.

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:17.800
It's good to see you too.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.800
I guess, you know, I should probably give back to work.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.800
Right.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.800
Me too.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.280
Some wires.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.280
I'll talk to you later.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.280
Okay.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.280
Bye.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:45.030
Bye, Jen.

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:46.030
Hey, Liz.

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.030
A couple of us are going to see a movie later.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.030
Would you like to come?

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:52.030
Yes.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.030
Okay.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:54.030
Great.

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:57.030
So, tonight, around seven.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:58.030
Okay.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:59.030
All right.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:00.030
That sounds perfect.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.030
See you tonight, then.

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:04.110
Okay.

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:58.610
Bye.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:50:59.610
Cheers.

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:00.610
I'd like to introduce to you,

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:51.739
brother and sister, John and Elizabeth Shaw.

00:51:51.739 --> 00:51:53.739
Leaving?

00:51:53.739 --> 00:51:55.739
Does it matter?

00:51:55.739 --> 00:51:56.739
No.

00:51:56.739 --> 00:51:58.739
Not really.

00:51:58.739 --> 00:52:00.739
I just left some paperwork here.

00:52:00.739 --> 00:52:01.739
I'm working late.

00:52:01.739 --> 00:52:03.739
Of course you are.

00:52:03.739 --> 00:52:04.739
Yeah, well.

00:52:04.739 --> 00:52:06.739
At least I'll get a break from the nagging.

00:52:06.739 --> 00:52:07.739
Yes, Zach.

00:52:07.739 --> 00:52:08.739
What do I get?

00:52:08.739 --> 00:52:09.739
You get your freedom.

00:52:09.739 --> 00:52:11.739
I don't want freedom.

00:52:11.739 --> 00:52:12.739
You know what I want.

00:52:12.739 --> 00:52:14.739
Are we really going to do this again?

00:52:14.739 --> 00:52:15.739
What's the point?

00:52:15.739 --> 00:52:17.739
The point is, you're never home.

00:52:17.739 --> 00:52:19.739
You never spend any time with your family.

00:52:19.739 --> 00:52:22.739
You must be the most self-centered man I know.

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:23.739
Oh, and I know you.

00:52:23.739 --> 00:52:26.739
Where's the sweet support of girl that I married?

00:52:26.739 --> 00:52:29.739
Whatever happened to reaching out and getting baptized.

00:52:29.739 --> 00:52:31.739
Look, I'm not exactly taking it easy.

00:52:31.739 --> 00:52:33.739
I'm trying to support all of this.

00:52:33.739 --> 00:52:34.739
Remember?

00:52:34.739 --> 00:52:35.739
Oh, and there it is.

00:52:35.739 --> 00:52:37.739
The one thing you're still good at.

00:52:37.739 --> 00:52:38.739
Excuses.

00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:40.739
And you wonder why I'm never here.

00:52:40.739 --> 00:52:42.739
This conversation is over.

00:52:42.739 --> 00:52:44.739
That's not all that's over.

00:52:44.739 --> 00:52:45.739
Oh, yeah?

00:52:45.739 --> 00:52:46.739
Yeah.

00:52:46.739 --> 00:53:13.820
Fine.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:14.820
Any way you want it.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.820
I was begging.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.820
I feel like I'm never seeing her anymore.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:22.199
To be honest, I don't see her much anymore either.

00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:23.199
Is she okay?

00:53:23.199 --> 00:53:24.199
I...

00:53:24.199 --> 00:53:29.170
She's going through another rough patch with Zach.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.170
I'm so sorry.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.170
I was hoping things were getting better.

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.929
Thank you.

00:53:34.929 --> 00:53:47.139
You were talking, too?

00:53:47.139 --> 00:53:48.139
It was.

00:53:48.139 --> 00:53:50.139
I wanted to ask about Megan.

00:53:50.139 --> 00:53:52.139
I just did.

00:53:52.139 --> 00:53:54.139
It doesn't sound good.

00:53:54.139 --> 00:53:56.139
I know the elders have tried.

00:53:56.139 --> 00:54:00.139
And now it's really up to them to apply Bible principles.

00:54:00.139 --> 00:54:01.139
Yeah.

00:54:01.139 --> 00:54:05.139
Last time I talked to Megan, she said every time they try and talk it into an argument.

00:54:05.139 --> 00:54:07.139
No two people agree on everything.

00:54:07.139 --> 00:54:11.139
But when we disagree, we have to be kind to one another.

00:54:11.139 --> 00:54:14.679
I just hope it's not too late.

00:54:14.679 --> 00:54:18.679
It never is if they're willing to act unselfishly.

00:54:18.679 --> 00:54:20.679
Oh, that's so true.

00:54:20.679 --> 00:54:23.679
I know every marriage goes through some tough times.

00:54:23.679 --> 00:54:29.679
But if we followed Jehovah's example of unselfish love, we always get through it.

00:54:29.679 --> 00:54:31.679
I just wonder if Megan still believes that.

00:54:31.679 --> 00:55:30.150
Look fantastic.

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:32.460
Thanks.

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.460
So you're not stored in a coffee bar, are you?

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:35.460
You remember that?

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:39.460
I have a near-photographic memory for all coffee-related facts.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.460
So it's a little busy in here.

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.460
You want to go outside?

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.460
Because in fresh air?

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.460
Yeah, sure.

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:52.059
A place out over there.

00:55:52.059 --> 00:55:56.559
Oh, it's much better out here.

00:55:56.559 --> 00:55:57.559
It's amazing.

00:55:57.559 --> 00:55:58.559
Yeah.

00:55:58.559 --> 00:55:59.559
Pretty view.

00:55:59.559 --> 00:56:03.380
So what do you do, Landon?

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.380
I'm a live counselor.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:07.380
Like a psychiatrist.

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:08.380
You could say that.

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:13.380
But more specifically, I focus on couples with marrow problems.

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.380
So you're married?

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:16.380
Divorced, actually.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.380
Wait, isn't that a little hypocritical?

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:20.380
Trust me, it's not.

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:23.380
I don't help couples force themselves together.

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.380
I help them to confront their issues.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:28.380
And sometimes it's best to say.

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:31.380
Sometimes it's best to leave.

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:35.719
So, what category are you in?

00:56:35.719 --> 00:56:38.719
Sorry, just an occupational hazard.

00:56:38.719 --> 00:56:42.719
Honestly, I came here tonight to just forget my problems.

00:56:42.719 --> 00:56:44.719
Ah, that's cool.

00:56:44.719 --> 00:56:45.719
I'm curious, though.

00:56:45.719 --> 00:56:47.719
Did you ever marry anybody I know?

00:56:47.719 --> 00:56:48.719
Invite from school?

00:56:48.719 --> 00:56:50.719
No, he was in my congregation growing up.

00:56:50.719 --> 00:56:51.719
All right.

00:56:51.719 --> 00:56:53.719
You were, uh, Jova's witness.

00:56:53.719 --> 00:56:54.719
Yeah.

00:56:54.719 --> 00:56:55.719
Still?

00:56:55.719 --> 00:56:56.719
Of course.

00:56:56.719 --> 00:56:57.719
Nice.

00:56:57.719 --> 00:56:59.719
We'll make it listen.

00:56:59.719 --> 00:57:01.719
Here's a little bit of free advice.

00:57:01.719 --> 00:57:04.719
Now, granted, I don't know your situation.

00:57:04.719 --> 00:57:08.719
I've seen a lot of couples stay in bad marriages.

00:57:08.719 --> 00:57:11.719
Now, they married on impulse, but then as time goes by,

00:57:11.719 --> 00:57:13.719
they just always have nothing to common.

00:57:13.719 --> 00:57:16.719
Instead of just accepting that, making a clean break,

00:57:16.719 --> 00:57:20.719
you know, they try and stick it out or they try and be known.

00:57:20.719 --> 00:57:22.719
The whole time, they're just drifting emotionally.

00:57:22.719 --> 00:57:23.719
They're just pruning.

00:57:23.719 --> 00:57:24.719
They just stop.

00:57:24.719 --> 00:57:25.719
You don't agree?

00:57:25.719 --> 00:57:29.719
It's just that the Bible says that two shall become one flesh.

00:57:29.719 --> 00:57:34.719
It says that, but you think you're really going to be happy

00:57:34.719 --> 00:57:38.719
taking relationship advice from a book written 2,000 years ago.

00:57:38.719 --> 00:57:41.719
What about trusting your heart?

00:57:41.719 --> 00:57:43.719
And if you look in there,

00:57:43.719 --> 00:57:46.719
you'll realize you haven't found your soulmate yet.

00:57:46.719 --> 00:57:49.719
I don't believe in soulmates landing.

00:57:49.719 --> 00:57:50.719
Really?

00:57:50.719 --> 00:57:53.719
Then why'd you come here tonight?

00:57:53.719 --> 00:57:58.039
Well, when you were ready to deal with this,

00:57:58.039 --> 00:57:59.039
here's my card.

00:57:59.039 --> 00:58:01.800
Go ahead.

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:05.489
I'll talk to you soon.

00:58:05.489 --> 00:58:27.099
Hey, babe.

00:58:27.099 --> 00:58:30.599
How was your day?

00:58:30.599 --> 00:58:33.079
Yeah?

00:58:33.079 --> 00:58:39.460
Liz?

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.460
You okay?

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:41.460
Yeah.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.460
I'm just worried about Megan.

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.960
What's going on?

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.960
She's got off the phone with Ellen,

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.960
and she says Zach moved out again.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:59.300
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.300
You tried calling her?

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:04.159
I tried calling, texting.

00:59:04.159 --> 00:59:07.159
She's not responding.

00:59:07.159 --> 00:59:09.159
What if you just went over there?

00:59:09.159 --> 00:59:12.980
The rest time we talked to it,

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.980
it really didn't go so well.

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.980
I'm sorry, babe.

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:23.289
Let me see if maybe I can find something that'll help, okay?

00:59:23.289 --> 00:59:50.159
Just reminding me of you

00:59:50.159 --> 00:59:53.159
and made me think how we can help Megan right now.

00:59:53.159 --> 00:59:55.159
It says,

00:59:55.159 --> 00:59:57.159
a true friend shows love at all times

00:59:57.159 --> 01:00:01.159
and is a brother who is born for times of distress.

01:00:02.159 --> 01:00:04.159
Don't you think that's the kind of friendship

01:00:04.159 --> 01:00:05.159
you need right now?

01:00:05.159 --> 01:00:19.500
You used to be injured?

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.500
What is Zach?

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.500
What are you doing here?

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.500
Oh, you don't answer your phone.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500
What choice do I have?

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500
Sorry, I changed my number.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500
I haven't had a chance to let everybody know yet.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.500
It's okay.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.500
Can I come in?

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.500
Um, yeah.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.500
I mean, I have a few minutes.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.500
Perfect.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:40.269
She's with my parents today.

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:42.269
I have an appointment to get to.

01:00:42.269 --> 01:00:45.119
Oh, okay.

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:48.199
What's all this?

01:00:48.199 --> 01:00:49.199
You don't want to know.

01:00:49.199 --> 01:00:57.650
You have phone numbers, secret papers.

01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:59.650
It's not the Megan I know.

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:03.650
Megan you knew wouldn't file for divorce either.

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:06.650
You're getting a divorce?

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:08.650
It's just the beginning stages, but...

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:10.650
Megan, this isn't making any sense.

01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:15.239
Is this what Zach wants?

01:01:15.239 --> 01:01:19.239
Look, I'm not going to waste any more of my life being unhappy.

01:01:19.239 --> 01:01:24.260
What about what you'll want?

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.260
You married a man that loves Jehovah.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.260
You still have our times when we don't see eye to eye.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.260
But with the Bible's help...

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:32.260
spare me the sermon, okay?

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.260
You don't get it.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:37.260
No, I don't.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.260
Megan, I care about you.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:48.929
I appreciate your concern, but I don't need your help anymore.

01:01:48.929 --> 01:01:50.929
I'm helping myself.

01:01:50.929 --> 01:01:53.929
So if you don't mind, I have an appointment to get to.

01:01:53.929 --> 01:02:32.090
Megan.

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:33.090
Dad?

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:35.090
What are you doing here?

01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:37.090
I'm looking for you.

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:38.090
Mom told you.

01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:40.090
I told her not to say anything.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.090
You shouldn't even be here.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.090
I'm already late.

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:43.090
Megan.

01:02:43.090 --> 01:03:15.199
How many times is it going to happen?

01:03:15.199 --> 01:03:16.199
How many times is it going to happen?

01:03:16.199 --> 01:03:17.199
Do you want me to eat garbage?

01:03:17.199 --> 01:03:18.199
Do you want the clients to eat garbage?

01:03:18.199 --> 01:03:19.199
I didn't think so.

01:03:19.199 --> 01:03:20.199
So get it right.

01:03:20.199 --> 01:03:21.199
Excuse me, I'll be back in a second.

01:03:21.199 --> 01:03:25.500
Okay.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.119
You okay?

01:03:30.119 --> 01:03:31.119
Look, I'm just tired, okay?

01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:32.119
I'll be fine.

01:03:32.119 --> 01:03:33.119
Come on, talk to me.

01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:35.119
Everything okay at home?

01:03:35.119 --> 01:03:37.429
Things are great at home.

01:03:37.429 --> 01:03:38.429
Come on.

01:03:38.429 --> 01:03:40.429
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

01:03:40.429 --> 01:03:42.429
You wouldn't understand.

01:03:42.429 --> 01:03:43.429
Try me.

01:03:43.429 --> 01:03:47.860
We're getting a divorce, okay?

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.269
What?

01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:51.269
Witnesses don't get divorced.

01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:52.269
You told me that.

01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:54.269
Look, it's something that she wants.

01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:56.269
All right.

01:03:56.269 --> 01:03:58.269
What about you?

01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:59.269
What do you want?

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:04.429
I don't even know anymore.

01:04:04.429 --> 01:04:10.489
Peace.

01:04:10.489 --> 01:04:15.280
I just want some peace in my life.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.280
Look, obviously, I'm no marriage counselor.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.280
But I've known you a long time.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.280
And I've seen what happens when you.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.280
When you work hard, you know?

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.280
You work hard and things go well.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.280
What are you talking about?

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.280
I guess what I'm trying to say.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.280
Does it make sense?

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:36.280
If you work harder on your marriage?

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.280
Is that something they'd say at those meetings

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.980
or something you read in the Bible or something like that?

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.980
Are you kidding me?

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.980
You're taking sides with the Bible now?

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:49.980
You're the same guy that told me to focus on this place.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.980
I did tell you to focus on this place.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.980
And maybe that was a mistake.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.980
As your friend, you just seemed happier

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.980
when you were going to those meetings.

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.980
I mean, does that make sense?

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:01.980
We are done here.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.980
Why?

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:03.980
I'm just trying to help you out.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:18.340
Oh, I forgot how beautiful it is around here.

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.340
It just seems smaller now.

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.340
You were only seven last time we were here back.

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:26.340
Yeah, I wish I could go back.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:38.039
I didn't come here to say I told you so.

01:05:38.039 --> 01:05:41.039
And I'm not here to judge you.

01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:44.039
So you came here to change my mind.

01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:47.039
Sweetie, you're not seven anymore.

01:05:47.039 --> 01:05:49.039
You have to make your own choices.

01:05:49.039 --> 01:05:50.039
That's right.

01:05:50.039 --> 01:05:52.039
I'm choosing to be happy.

01:05:52.039 --> 01:05:54.039
I made plenty of mistakes.

01:05:54.039 --> 01:05:57.039
But I'm ready to move on.

01:05:57.039 --> 01:06:00.039
And you think this divorce is going to help you move on?

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.039
Yes.

01:06:01.039 --> 01:06:05.320
I didn't set the best example spiritually.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.320
I didn't take the lead like I should have.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.320
And I'm really sorry for that.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.320
No, Megan.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:18.320
I've been doing a lot of praying about your mother and me.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.320
About you.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.320
I've decided I need to do better spiritually.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.320
So I'm starting now.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.320
I don't think I understand.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.320
What do you mean?

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.320
Before you go through with this divorce.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.320
Let me ask you one question.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.320
What is it that brought you to this moment?

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.860
I don't know.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.860
I guess Zach wasn't the one.

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.860
No, sweetheart.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.860
You made a choice.

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.860
You chose Zach.

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:56.869
And did you include Jehovah in that choice?

01:06:56.869 --> 01:06:58.869
Probably not.

01:06:58.869 --> 01:07:00.869
And now you're unhappy.

01:07:00.869 --> 01:07:02.869
God, I know all this.

01:07:02.869 --> 01:07:03.869
Meg, look.

01:07:03.869 --> 01:07:05.869
Here's the point.

01:07:05.869 --> 01:07:09.869
You're about to make another huge decision.

01:07:09.869 --> 01:07:12.869
And who's not being included in that?

01:07:12.869 --> 01:07:16.869
Sweetheart, happiness is always going to allude you.

01:07:16.869 --> 01:07:19.869
If you keep leading Jehovah out of the picture.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.869
You just don't get it.

01:07:22.869 --> 01:07:26.719
You'd be surprised, Megan.

01:07:26.719 --> 01:07:28.719
Yeah, I doubt it.

01:07:28.719 --> 01:07:35.119
What do you see when you look at your mother and me?

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:38.119
You guys love each other.

01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:41.119
We do.

01:07:41.119 --> 01:07:43.119
We do.

01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:47.119
But our marriage is imperfect.

01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:49.119
No marriage is.

01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:53.119
It's made up of two imperfect people.

01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:56.590
A sweetie.

01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:58.590
A love centered on Jehovah.

01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:01.590
It takes those two imperfect halves.

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:05.409
And makes them one flesh.

01:08:05.409 --> 01:08:08.409
But why do I have to make the sacrifice?

01:08:08.409 --> 01:08:11.239
You made the vow.

01:08:11.239 --> 01:08:18.680
The key loves me anymore.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.680
Maybe he thinks the same about you.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.680
Reach out to him.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:28.640
Trust him.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.640
You did come here to change my mind.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:46.989
No sweetheart, because I love you.

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:48.989
Love is patient and kind.

01:08:48.989 --> 01:08:53.779
It's not look for its own interest.

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:56.779
It does not become provoked.

01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:59.779
It does not keep account of the injury.

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:03.779
It bears all things, believes all things,

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:05.779
hopes all things,

01:09:05.779 --> 01:09:07.779
and doors all things.

01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:16.659
Look, I know you don't want me here, okay?

01:09:16.659 --> 01:09:18.659
I just came to get a few things.

01:09:18.659 --> 01:09:19.659
Don't worry.

01:09:19.659 --> 01:09:20.659
I want to talk about that.

01:09:20.659 --> 01:09:21.659
No.

01:09:21.659 --> 01:09:23.659
Save it, okay?

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:30.810
I'm tired of this.

01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:31.810
Never fails.

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:40.460
Zack.

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:44.250
Why can't you just leave it alone?

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:45.250
I'm sick of this, Megan.

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.250
Zack, I just want to talk to you, please.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:49.250
You may tell me more things I'm not doing.

01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.250
How long are we going to do this?

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:56.829
No.

01:09:56.829 --> 01:09:58.829
I don't.

01:09:58.829 --> 01:09:59.829
It was a mistake.

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:01.829
You said so yourself.

01:10:01.829 --> 01:10:05.289
Which one is it, Megan?

01:10:05.289 --> 01:10:06.289
Huh?

01:10:06.289 --> 01:10:07.289
Make up your mind.

01:10:07.289 --> 01:10:16.899
I was wrong.

01:10:16.899 --> 01:10:19.949
Got a good father.

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:20.949
I'm not a good husband.

01:10:21.949 --> 01:10:23.949
And I never did get baptized.

01:10:23.949 --> 01:10:26.949
So there, you win.

01:10:26.949 --> 01:10:30.949
The only thing I was ever good at was making excuses.

01:10:30.949 --> 01:10:32.949
So why don't you just leave?

01:10:32.949 --> 01:10:43.279
Did you just hear what I said?

01:10:43.279 --> 01:10:54.850
But why would you want to stay with me?

01:10:54.850 --> 01:11:58.590
Instead, I'm trying hard to apply Bible principles.

01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:02.590
I don't know if Zack will ever make the truth his own.

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:04.590
But with Jehovah's help,

01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:06.590
I'll make it through.

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:10.590
Thanks for never giving up on me.

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:12.590
That's fantastic.

01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:27.850
He decided to stop by Paul and Priscilla's one last time

01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:28.850
before our trip.

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:31.850
They were so excited for us.

01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:34.850
It was hard to believe that after all these years,

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.850
we had finally been accepted to Kingdom Evangelizer School.

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:42.420
The fields have been an inspiration to me.

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.420
A true love can be found

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:47.420
if we put Jehovah and his principles first in our life.

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.420
True love is enduring

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:53.420
and can be enjoyed for all eternity.

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.420
And in the end, Priscilla was right.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:00.420
Now I am starting a whole new chapter in my life.
