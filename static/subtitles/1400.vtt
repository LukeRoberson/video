00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:27.750
Need to your phone, Rust?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.750
It's Jade, again.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.750
We've only studied once this month.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.750
She's so unscheduled.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.750
I thought you said she was doing well.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750
She was.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.100
Now it's just, see you later.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.100
How was your last study?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.729
That's a very interesting question, but...

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.729
It's not really what we're talking about in this paragraph, is it?

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:53.729
So...

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.729
Let's just read the scripture, shall we?

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:09.000
In my defense, I was annoyed.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
She never even attempts to explain why she can't solve.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I understand.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Really, I do.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But if she's still open to studying,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you can't let these little things drain your enthusiasm.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I know. I just...

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I wish she was more structured.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's like she doesn't take anything seriously.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
No study's perfect.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
She's making some effort.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Focus on that.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If anyone's infusiasm is contagious, it's yours.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:56.989
I haven't mentioned it already.

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:58.989
I really love our chats.

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:01.989
And I appreciate all your questions.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.989
Thanks.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.989
I know sometimes they're crazy.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:07.989
No, you're a deep thinker.

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.990
It's good.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.219
For both of us.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.219
Yeah, we're cool.
