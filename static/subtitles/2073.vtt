00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:15.630
On Saturday, March 14th, 2015, the 138th class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead graduated.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.629
The audience anticipated a spiritually uplifting program.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:25.629
The day began with the first of four brand new Kingdom songs entitled,

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:28.629
Preaching to All Sorts of People.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:36.729
Preaching everywhere all sorts of people.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:46.729
Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body opened the program by speaking of what the soon-to-be gilead graduates are expected to do with the things they have learned.

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:53.729
So with that in mind, for you to be able to entrust to others what you've learned,

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:58.729
it requires that you have the correct viewpoint with regard to privileges.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.729
Treasure privileges, but not hoard them.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.730
You see, Jehovah's Arrangement is for us to train others.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.730
And as we train them, they become qualified.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.730
And perhaps then they can train others.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.730
We should never, ever, ever hoard those privileges.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.730
In his talk entitled,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.730
Will you be frightened by the sound of a leaf?

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.730
Kenneth Flo Dean, a helper for the Teaching Committee, drew upon an incident from ancient Israel.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.730
What a ludicrous word picture.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.730
Running scared from a dried-up leaf.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.730
Well, when new students get to your assignments, no matter what challenges you face,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.730
will you be intimidated?

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.730
Will you be frightful?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.730
Face them.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.730
With Jehovah's help, just you them as a mere shriveled-up leaf.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.730
Mark Sanderson of the governing body, then ask the students.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.730
What are you looking for?

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.730
This is a very important question.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.730
Because what you're looking for will greatly affect what you will find.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.729
Look to be the humble servant of your brothers and sisters.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.729
And do the very best you can to accomplish the will of Jehovah.

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:19.729
And then you will never be disappointed with what you find.

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:27.479
James Cauthen of the Theocratic Schools Department, developed the theme,

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.479
Will you feed the hungry?

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:37.479
He said that there's more hunger for love and appreciation in this world than there is for bread.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:42.479
Seek once all of God's people to feel unworthy and unloved.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:47.479
Do not let that happen to your brothers. Feed the hungry.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:52.479
Use what you've learned in the last five months to counteract the schemes of the devil.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:03:00.479
Another Gilead instructor, Mark Numer, used the Apostle Paul's example of self-sacrificing service to others.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.479
In his talk, good to the last draw.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:09.479
Do that his example of himself pouring himself out, not only honored Jehovah God,

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:16.479
but it strengthened others and encouraged others so that they too could re-evaluate their motives for serving God.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:21.479
Like Paul, your willingness to pour yourselves out on behalf of the kingdom,

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:30.479
behalf of the interests of Jehovah God, shows that your desire to please Jehovah in Christ is what defines you.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:41.620
The audience was eager for the opportunity to sing a second new song entitled The Life of a Pioneer.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.620
The next portion of the program, using the language of the heart, being alert,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.620
featured the student's recent experiences in the field ministry.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.620
I have a message from God for you.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.620
Have you pleased head of a government soon to come?

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.620
Don't you think that this time might be now?

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.620
William Turner, a helper to the service committee of the governing body,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:21.620
directed four students of the graduating class in discussing how they can keep contributing to the good news.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.620
Whenever I am in peace with Jehovah, I will also be in peace with my brothers and sisters.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.620
It's made me resolve to base my joy in future, not just on my work assignment or other circumstances that might change,

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.620
but really from just dwelling on how Jehovah feels, how he's pleased if I just do what he asks of me.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:49.620
Gilead is stressed in me that I should never let the devil weaken my love for my brothers and sisters

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.620
and slow down the preaching of the good news.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.620
After singing the third new song, searching for friends of peace,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.620
Samuel Hurt of the governing body gave the keynote talk of the day entitled,

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.620
Keep Your Eyes on Jehovah.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:16.620
But the question still lingers, how does mankind see Jehovah if not with the little eye?

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.620
What is with the eyes of the heart?

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:27.620
But today we must keep our eyes fixed on Jehovah to observe what he wants to be done and accomplishing his will.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.620
We rivet our eyes on Jehovah that way.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.620
In the days ahead we may be surrounded by our enemies and we don't know what to do.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.620
Whether go to the left or to the right, straight ahead, back up, then turn your eyes heaven.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.620
Turn your eyes to Jehovah. Look up, he is not hiding.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.620
He will let himself be found by you.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:58.000
Now is the opportunity to introduce to you the 138th Class of Gilead.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.370
Following the distribution of the diplomas, a class representative read a letter of appreciation

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.370
addressed to the governing body and the Bethel family.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.370
You have cared for all our needs and have done so much to assist us in practical ways.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.370
After a few parting thoughts to the graduates, the day concluded as it began.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:28.370
With a brand new kingdom song entitled, Teach them to stand firm, reflecting a main point of the day.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:38.120
Yes, be sure to entrust to faithful persons the beautiful things that you've learned here at Gilead.
