WEBVTT

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.589
Brothers and sisters, we are delighted to have you with us and you will be happy to know that to brother Harold Corcoran will be our

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:10.689
co-host this month.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.689
It's a pleasure to be with you.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.050
Harold, why don't you share with our audience what we can look forward to on the program?

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.750
Of course.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.050
Those of you who have wondered what it's like to serve where the need is greater will love this segment.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.049
It's not a family that left everything and moved to a country far away to widen out in their ministry.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.369
And if you have ever compared yourself to someone else,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.890
perhaps when you've seen your fellow brother or sister progress faster spiritually than you did,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.929
then pay close attention to how this brother reasons from the Scriptures on how to avoid envy.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.450
Also, our team met a sister who used to be a national sports champion, but found something better.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.170
The truth transformed her life.

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.810
This is the August program of JW Broadcast.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:27.299
I would like to talk about generosity. It's such a beautiful quality.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.900
We all like it when someone is generous to us, but what about the other way around?

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:40.019
Ask yourself, what others in my family or my congregation view me as being a generous person,

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.060
or might they view me as stingy or possibly oblivious to the needs of others?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.379
Ephesians 5.1 urges us to become imitators of God.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.579
Jehovah is very generous indeed.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.379
Think of the ransom of his son.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.620
Jehovah generously brought back our future hope of everlasting life.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180
Can we imitate his generosity?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.819
At Luke 11 13, Jesus likened Jehovah to a loving parent.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.539
Just as a parent gives good gifts to his children, Jesus said,

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:19.139
how much more so will the Father in heaven give Holy Spirit to those asking him?

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:25.300
Similarly, if anyone is in need of wisdom, he can simply ask Jehovah.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:32.259
James chapter 1 verse 5 says that he gives generously and without reproaching.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.979
Jesus too was a generous person. Do you remember his first miracle?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.620
He was at a marriage feast and the wine ran out to avoid embarrassment on the part of the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.259
newly married couple and to ensure that the guests enjoyed the rest of the meal.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:57.379
Jesus turned 100 gallons or almost 380 liters of water into fine wine.

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.939
That was generous indeed.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:08.099
Now back to our earlier question, do those in my family or my congregation view me as being a

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.180
generous person? What are some ways that I can show generosity?

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.870
Due to the economy in the past few years, many of our brothers were out of work

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.590
for a period of time. The governing body is aware that many of you generously provided food

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.909
and even money so that their families could get by. We commend you for your generosity.

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.310
In fact, that is exactly what Jehovah wanted you to do.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.789
Now due to Ronomy chapter 15 verse 10, it says,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.349
you should generously give to him and you should not give to him grudgingly.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.629
For this is why Jehovah, your God, will bless your every deed and undertaking.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.270
Did you notice that we are to give but to do so with the right attitude?

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:08.430
He said not grudgingly and when we show such generosity,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.229
Jehovah will indeed bless our every deed and undertaking.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.310
Maybe you have experienced that. When we give to others,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.949
often we find we are blessed with more than we gave away in the first place.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.189
Proverbs 11-24 makes that very point. It says, one gives generously and ends up with more.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:35.629
Jesus Himself said, practice giving and people will give to you.

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:40.110
In addition to providing materially to those in need,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.709
how else can we demonstrate this spirit of giving?

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.230
In our May program, Brother Lat explained the goal of the governing body to accelerate

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.870
the building of places of worship and other theocratic facilities.

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:04.189
We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your generous response over the past few

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:12.670
months and for your continued support of this all-important work. Thank you very much.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.750
How about this one? Are we generous when it comes to forgiving those who have offended us in some

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:31.420
way? Come again? I ask if we are generous for givers. The religious leaders in the first

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.779
century taught that you only had to forgive a person three times. That was it.

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:44.300
But Jesus taught Peter that that was being stingy, knowing that three times was the limit.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.860
The religious leaders established Peter no doubt thought. He was generous when he asked Jesus at

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:59.339
Matthew 1821, how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him? Up to seven

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:07.980
times? Peter likely thought he was being generous seven times. That was more than twice the limit

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:15.259
that was established back then. However, what did Jesus say in response? You're too stingy, Peter.

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:25.180
In verse 22, Jesus said to him, I say to you not up to seven times, but up to seventy seven times.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:33.899
Now that was generous. We don't keep count. We just keep on forgiving our imperfect brothers

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:42.300
and sisters. Divine forgiveness is expensive. It's generous. Psalm 86.5 says of Jehovah,

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:52.540
for you are good and ready to forgive. How are we doing in this regard? Are we ready to forgive

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:59.899
when our feelings are heard? Are we offended? We can be generous with our time. Are we quick to

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:06.379
volunteer to clean or maintain the kingdom hall? How about spending time visiting the sick or

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:12.699
elderly in our congregation? Are helping a new student on the Theocratic ministry school to

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:20.540
prepare his talk? Time is a precious commodity. Are we generous in doling it out for such

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:28.620
noble purposes? Speaking of giving of our time, are we generous when it comes to the ministry?

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:36.459
At Philippians 1.5, Paul called it the contribution you have made to the good news. It's true,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:44.620
all of us have different circumstances. But if we look over our publisher record card for the past

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:52.300
six months, would we consider ourselves to be generous in the amount of time we devoted to

00:07:52.300 --> 00:08:03.740
sharing the good news? Husbands, wives, parents, elders, pioneers, publishers? Do we generously give

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:12.620
commendation to others? Problems 3.27 says, do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it.

00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:22.699
Do we sometimes withhold the commendation? Why would we do that? At times we simply forget to tell

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:30.699
someone what we appreciate about them. On the other hand, some find it easy to commend those who

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:38.940
they consider are inferior to them or those who are superior to them. But at times we might have

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:48.139
trouble commending a peer. We might think, if I commend him, he might think he's better than I am.

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:56.460
Or suppose there is a brother who gave a very good talk in the congregation. But you were somewhat

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:04.139
annoyed by his overuse of the expression. Do you know what I mean? We might feel that if we

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:13.019
commend him on his talk that we're tacitly approving his overuse of that phrase, do you know

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:20.220
what I mean? Why not sincerely commend him on something you specifically appreciated about the

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:27.259
talk? Of course, if you are an elder or the Theocratic minister's school overseer, you might

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:36.460
bring the overuse phrase to his attention, but after sincere commendation. All of us appreciate

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:43.259
commendation. Three times, Jehovah's voice was heard from the heavens giving him commendation,

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:51.259
approving his son. In Revelation chapter 2, Jesus provides commendation to several congregations

00:09:51.259 --> 00:10:02.779
in Asia Minor. Yes, a word spoken at the right time. How good it is. At Acts 2035, Jesus is quoted as

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:11.419
saying, there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving. With that simple statement,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:20.059
Jesus captured the essence of true generosity. A generous person gives freely of his time,

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:27.659
energy and resources to benefit others. And generosity is measured not by the size of the gift,

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:36.779
but by the motive of the giver. Again, the governing body wanted me to take this opportunity

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:43.500
to thank all of you for your continued generous support of the worldwide work.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:51.500
Brother Corcoran will now share some examples of brothers and sisters who have shown generosity

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:57.580
in their lives, Harold. Yes, you're about to meet the Williams family from Britain.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.179
Their circumstances allow them to generously give of their time and resources

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:10.460
by serving where the need is greater. But was it easy? No, but their desire to serve Jehovah helped

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:21.379
them overcome their fears. The things that I'm scared about are also the things I'm excited about.

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:34.059
I think it's fear of the unknown. It's leaving one life behind and you're what we're going into

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:42.940
this totally brand new life. It's going to be mixed emotions leaving the house because I know

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:51.259
there's so much ahead of me that it's going to be wonderful. We focus on the future and things

00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:59.090
ahead. My name is Mark Williams. I'm a father and a husband. The circuit overseer came to the

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:07.169
congregation and he showed the video good news to every nation tribe and Tongue. And as a family

00:12:07.169 --> 00:12:13.090
man when I saw that when Alison saw that we thought well maybe that's that's something that we could do.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.690
So we were just kind of nudging each other and thinking well look at that that's fantastic.

00:12:19.809 --> 00:12:27.090
My name is Alison Williams and I live in Buckingham. We wanted to take our children into an environment where

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:37.889
they could blossom and thrive spiritually. So they're all kind of contributed to us thinking well

00:12:39.169 --> 00:12:45.409
why don't we why don't we take a trip why don't we go and visit Ecuador at least to see.

00:12:45.409 --> 00:12:52.210
We went from month to visit Ecuador while the lunch was one of the best months we had.

00:12:52.929 --> 00:12:59.230
We did get many of our questions answered. I'd never put a lot of

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:08.590
thought into whether I could go and serve in another country because I was probably holding on to

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:18.029
my life here, life in the congregation, life in this out in our little home and the business as well.

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:23.470
Well we eventually did come to the point where we made the decision that we would go.

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:30.110
In eight weeks time we are leaving England to go to Ecuador to serve where they need

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.230
us greater. We're also proud of each other. I'm so proud of the children in March because

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:41.549
they've got rid of so many things that have been close to their hearts and yet they've had such a

00:13:41.549 --> 00:14:07.330
great spirit about it that it's made me feel really really proud of them. We're going to serve

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:23.379
in a city in Ecuador called Quenca which is in the Andes. So it's cooler which is easier for us

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:30.019
Brits. It's a it's a combination of trying to bring together two needs the needs that's in the field

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:37.090
but also we have needs as a family to make sure that particularly our children feel comfortable.

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:42.049
The meetings have been wonderful because the brothers have given us such a warm welcome.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:47.169
They just have showered us with love and they've been so patient even though we don't know the language.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.409
One brother said you'll speak a bit like Tarzan and Jane and that's exactly how I feel.

00:14:59.009 --> 00:15:04.529
The other day I was involved in some street work, left an invitation with an old man, shook my hand,

00:15:05.169 --> 00:15:09.570
sport lots of Spanish that I didn't understand but when I left him and walked down the road I

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.250
looked back and there he is, he's got the invitation open, he's reading it. I think they're just

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:19.009
happy to hear his try. Whoever you are in a cafe or a restaurant or the taxi or a bus,

00:15:19.649 --> 00:15:29.120
everybody is ready to hear about Jehovah. I really enjoy being with the Lopez family. I've

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:38.559
worked with Angel on the Ministry a few times. Actually we didn't know each other but in a matter of

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:45.279
about five minutes the ice was broken and it's like we've known each other for years.

00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:54.080
It's wonderful to have this worldwide family knowing wherever you go, you'll have friends

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.360
and it's been really special to have Paola waiting for me on the other side.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.200
And that can encourage us to do the same because really it's not impossible but an entire family

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:15.360
moving to another continent is something really encouraging. I really enjoy playing football,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.000
basketball because I've been able to make new friends and get to know the brothers and sisters

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:33.820
better. I see how happy Alison is and how content she is and I look at the children, the association

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:39.179
they've got, how they're included in so many different activities in it. And as far as when I see

00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:43.740
my children and as a husband when I see my wife so happy, that makes me happy so yeah it's all

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:53.139
been worth it. I just want to say thank you to my mom and dad for taking us here because we're already

00:16:53.139 --> 00:16:59.940
loving it, we've got new friends, we feel part of a new family and just to be able to experience

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:14.559
some ministry and service Jehovah in a totally different land. So it's not about the things that

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:19.359
we've left behind, it's the fact that we're doing this together as a family and that's what's

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:45.019
really important. What a beautiful family. Would your circumstances allow you to serve

00:17:45.019 --> 00:17:52.140
where the need is greater? If so, you will benefit from a very practical advice found in the August

00:17:52.140 --> 00:18:00.980
2011 Our Kingdom Ministry article entitled Can You Step Over Into Macedonia? But let's now look

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:08.019
at another aspect of generosity. As brother heard mentioned, commending our brothers and sisters

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:15.619
for a job well done is one form of generosity. But at times there may be something that has started

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:24.259
growing in our heart that prevents us from doing that. Yes, envy can seriously stifle our generous

00:18:24.259 --> 00:18:30.740
spirit. Pay close attention to how this brother worked on his Christian personality so that he could

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:46.289
be more generous in the congregation. My name is David, that's me there. No, not him in front,

00:18:46.289 --> 00:18:53.569
that's Mark, that's me, the one on the ladder. My relationship with Jehovah is the most

00:18:53.569 --> 00:18:59.809
precious thing in my life. I have always worked hard in the congregation, happy to serve my brothers

00:18:59.809 --> 00:19:09.490
and sisters. But something happened that tested my integrity. For a long time, it had been my goal

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:16.769
to become a ministerial servant. Just think of how much more I could give to the congregation.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:25.089
To Jehovah, the travelling overseer was visiting our congregation and I felt confident that I would

00:19:25.089 --> 00:19:36.059
be appointed. At the next meeting, a special announcement was made to the congregation.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:44.779
We are very happy to announce the appointment of a new ministerial servant in our congregation.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:20:05.420
Brother Mark, if I wasn't being appointed as a ministerial servant, how could they make him one?

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:15.150
He's only 19. I was too consumed with my thoughts and emotions to pay attention to the rest

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:23.950
of the meeting. Afterwards, I couldn't even bring myself to congratulate Mark. I never thought I would

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:58.420
feel this way about a decision made by the elders. I just don't get it. What does Mark have that I

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:08.940
don't? How could they overlook me? He didn't take much to remind me of my disappointment and to make

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:15.980
me feel bitter. Every time I walked into the kingdom hall, those feelings intensified.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:21.579
Being there was a constant reminder of what seemed to be injustice.

00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:30.619
What was the point in working so hard if no one noticed? I didn't know how much longer I could

00:21:30.619 --> 00:21:38.859
face it. I considered moving to a different congregation. Somewhere I would feel appreciated and could

00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:53.069
serve Jehovah better. I was torn into a decision like that required playful thought, injustice.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:22:12.480
Envy? The Bible speaks about a man who experienced similar emotions to mine.

00:22:13.359 --> 00:23:40.319
I decided to read about him. I couldn't imagine hurting my brother.

00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:53.650
But I was envying him. Just like Cain, sin was crouching at my door. Would I get the mastery of it?

00:23:53.650 --> 00:24:04.609
I had to act immediately before my feelings of envy could fester into something that could

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:23.650
damage my relationship with my brother and Jehovah. He told me how much he looked up to me,

00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:32.769
respected me. It was my example that encouraged him to reach out. I realized then that my work in

00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:42.609
the congregation did not go unnoticed. I was resolved to use this opportunity to prove my integrity

00:24:42.609 --> 00:24:53.279
and motives for serving Jehovah faithfully. Time flew by as I kept busy in the congregation.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:02.079
Now I have the privilege of serving as a ministerial servant alongside Mark.

00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:11.069
I regret how I reacted and how that affected my joy in serving Jehovah.

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:18.960
I'm so grateful I didn't let the roots of envy grow in my heart.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.690
Did you notice what aspects of generosity were highlighted in this example?

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:45.490
As we mentioned earlier, commendation was one. In the end, David generously commended Mark

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:53.569
for his fine work. But forgiveness is another aspect. Mark most likely noticed that David may have

00:25:53.569 --> 00:25:58.529
harbored resentment against him, but he never allowed that to come between him and his brother.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:06.289
Yes, showing generosity by means of commendation and forgiveness truly helps preserve the peace

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:13.200
in the congregation. Just like David and Mark worked together in the congregation to build

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.519
each other up, let's meet some brothers who helped each other find the truth.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:26.640
This story is about brother Atah Yaldiko. He is an Assyrian man from Iraq and was raised as a

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:32.400
Christian. Atah's childhood friend had noticed that Atah had a thirst for the truth.

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:38.559
But because of the political situation in Iraq, the two friends got separated and moved to

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:46.240
different countries in Europe. But was the geographical distance a problem? No. This is their story.

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:59.819
I was about 18 years old when one of my friends named Ziad asked me,

00:27:00.779 --> 00:27:08.380
Atah, have you read the Bible? We started to read the Bible from Genesis.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:15.819
I remember one time when we read the sermon on the Mount, we decided to go up to the mountain to

00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:27.980
read. Our hometown, Agotch, has many mountains. In June 1998, I was in an accident.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:38.220
In this accident, I lost both my legs. It was a difficult time because I was so young.

00:27:39.339 --> 00:27:47.980
I was 22 years old, so it was very hard. I remember I was that time in Holland and I

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:58.460
hear the news from the family, from Iraq. And I went somewhere alone and I started to cry.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.940
I came to Sweden and like many refugees, I had no desire to leave Iraq.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:20.180
I was talking to Ziad all the time and one day in 2006 he called me and told me

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:30.930
that he was studying with Jehovah's Witnesses. So I said to him, is it logical that two

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:37.890
billion Christians are wrong and that you are right? And after a few months I told him also that

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:45.730
I'm going to be baptized. When he said that, I thought I was going to get a heart attack.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:54.529
And he tried to convince me that it is not that rules, that it is maybe a big mistake

00:28:54.529 --> 00:29:01.569
what I'm going to make in my life. I remember it was in 2006. A brother, his name was Ziad.

00:29:02.849 --> 00:29:09.009
He talked to me about Atta. So I talked to a brother, Majid.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.490
Ziad had left a number with him and we agreed to meet in my apartment.

00:29:14.289 --> 00:29:16.769
I decided I would give the witnesses a chance.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:24.289
I started to study for a few months and after that he told me that he don't want to have a study.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:28.690
I had a lot of things to deal with. It was not the right time.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:36.289
I was too tired to listen. So I told him leave me for now because I cannot be bothered with anything.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:41.569
So what we did, that we just stopped the study but I still continue to phone him,

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:47.650
to visit him from time to time, to invite him to like the memorial or the convention.

00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:50.849
And that's what we did for several years.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:57.410
He was very patient with me and let it be up to me when and how we should study.

00:29:59.089 --> 00:30:01.730
But he kept in contact with me to check how I'm doing.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:09.730
For me, I knew very early that Atta will be a brother a day.

00:30:09.809 --> 00:30:18.690
He was so honest, he loved Jehovah, he loved Jesus Christ and he loved the truth.

00:30:22.849 --> 00:30:26.769
He was of great help to me. When my mother died,

00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:32.210
he and his wife really helped me in a way that changed my life.

00:30:32.529 --> 00:30:39.170
He invited me home to him and he asked me, can you just explain that for me?

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.609
Why should I get baptized?

00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:51.890
I told my Jesus that I have come to the conclusion, yes, I must be baptized, it is important.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.730
What convinced me was the way Jehovah and his organization treats people.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:05.089
Jehovah is not obligated to provide us with a hope for the future, but he does so out of love.

00:31:06.609 --> 00:31:09.170
He shows us more respect than we show ourselves.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.450
And the way the organization is united cannot come from him.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:23.490
So when I was home, we called Jehovah to Skype and he told me I can't find any reason

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.089
anymore not to be baptized.

00:31:27.089 --> 00:31:32.450
The Massakuri had the regional convention, August 9th 2014.

00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:36.829
It was a beautiful day.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.079
It was one of the biggest days in my life.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:50.640
So it was just a very warm feeling to be beside one of the best friends.

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:57.599
And remember that one day years ago we were trying to understand the battle without having any

00:31:57.599 --> 00:31:59.200
chance to understand it.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.359
And now we are sitting there Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:11.839
I often think, God, is it true, is it real? Do I really deserve to have all these blessings?

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:18.000
I don't have anything, no challenge to not understand everything yet,

00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:24.799
but still, thanks to God, I can understand the Bible.

00:32:28.099 --> 00:32:33.299
I think we don't need to be afraid that some people would never heard about the truth if they

00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:36.420
really want to know that. Jehovah would take care of it.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:42.660
So Jehovah was actually way too far out for many, many, many years.

00:32:47.779 --> 00:32:54.500
For me, when I think of the hope of the new world, I'll be honest and say that it is not a question

00:32:54.579 --> 00:33:00.740
about having my legs back and being able to jump like a gazelle. No, that is not what I think about

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:07.140
because there are problems in this world, both for me and for others, that make my legs not that

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:14.660
important. No, let me have a good conscience, let there be justice. By that I mean that

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:22.160
it is God who governs and no one else. True love, that is what I long for.

00:33:33.009 --> 00:33:36.769
How did these brothers display the Christian quality of generosity?

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:42.369
Well, for one, a ta's friend did his utmost to share the kingdom truth.

00:33:43.569 --> 00:33:49.329
But also, the brother who eventually studied with a ta provided loving support in times of

00:33:49.329 --> 00:33:54.930
distress, even though a ta had decided not to continue studying the Bible for the time being.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:34:03.250
And what an impact that had. Recently, an exciting announcement was made to the brothers and sisters

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:09.329
living in the Britain branch territory. Initial approval has been granted to relocate the local

00:34:09.329 --> 00:34:15.409
branch offices. In fact, this is the second largest construction project that our organization

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:25.329
is currently undertaking. Hundreds of brothers and sisters have worked for well over a year to get

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:33.489
the project to this stage. The first construction volunteers are now living on location.

00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:44.269
Hundreds more will be needed to transform this site into the new Britain branch office.

00:34:50.019 --> 00:34:53.539
Why is this move needed? And how will it be accomplished?

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:01.710
Jehovah's Witnesses have been sharing the Bible's message for over 100 years.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:07.550
Every year, more and more books and magazines are distributed.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:13.869
To organize this, Jehovah's Witnesses maintain branch offices around the world.

00:35:14.909 --> 00:35:19.949
Printing the world's most widely circulated magazines takes a lot of effort.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:25.469
To keep up, our branch offices must run efficiently.

00:35:26.909 --> 00:35:31.309
The branch office in Britain has a large part to play in this growing world.

00:35:31.869 --> 00:35:38.829
But faces challenges. Its properties are fragmented, spread out over a 10-mile radius.

00:35:39.789 --> 00:35:48.670
The decision was made to relocate. In 2014, an 85-acre property was purchased to accommodate

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:55.309
the new Britain branch office. Right now, the site is being prepared for construction.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:59.949
A small army of volunteers will then fit out the property,

00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:03.309
turning the site into a beautiful new Bethel home.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.119
It is expected that these new facilities will be completed and operational by December 31,

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:19.199
2019. At that time, the Bethel family will move in.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:37.070
Here, in this very office, skilled volunteers are hard at work designing the new branch.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:44.849
There are structural engineers, architects, interior designers,

00:36:44.849 --> 00:36:47.969
landscapers, solicitors and so many more.

00:36:48.929 --> 00:37:02.590
Each willingly gives of their time without charge. At the heart of the site will be the printer.

00:37:03.469 --> 00:37:07.710
Office buildings and support facilities will be situated nearby.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:11.630
Modest accommodation will house the Bethel family.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:16.829
These buildings will complement the beautiful countryside.

00:37:19.409 --> 00:37:22.369
Building this branch is a huge task.

00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:29.329
Jehova has always loved using willing volunteers on construction projects,

00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:32.369
such as the arc, the tabernacle and the temple.

00:37:35.199 --> 00:37:42.480
Jehova is no different today. He will use humble, hard-working volunteers

00:37:42.559 --> 00:37:48.159
to make this and many other construction projects around the world a success.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.199
What makes this work unique? These aren't just ordinary buildings.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.719
They are structures that support preaching the good news of God's Kingdom.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:10.179
There has never been a greater need for volunteers within Jehova's organisation.

00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:13.780
Can you be a part of this special project?

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:18.900
Are there construction projects that you can get involved in, where you live?

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:25.789
What hard work those brothers and sisters are putting into this project?

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:32.349
Jehova will undoubtedly bless them for generously giving of their time on this theocratic assignment.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.750
We will keep them in our prayers.

00:38:35.869 --> 00:38:39.469
We would now like to introduce you to Sister Tehrumi Ugura.

00:38:40.429 --> 00:38:44.110
This Japanese sister left a promising international career

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.909
to instead give of her energy to the true God.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:58.210
A road for racing, bicycle racing against my rivals down a road.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.889
A road I traveled just for myself.

00:39:04.289 --> 00:39:05.809
That was my life course.

00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:14.510
I started road bicycle racing when I was a university student.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:20.460
I won practically every race in Japan.

00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:24.860
I won the Japan National Championship twice.

00:39:25.659 --> 00:39:30.940
And even participated in the Asian Games and the 1988 Solo Olympics.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.260
Of course I was always happy when I won.

00:39:39.019 --> 00:39:41.420
But that happiness didn't last very long.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:49.469
Every time I won a race, I would be expected to win the next one.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.269
And I was overwhelmed with tremendous pressure.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.789
That frightened me.

00:39:55.789 --> 00:39:57.789
So I immersed myself in training.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.980
Train, race, train, race.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.059
I was racing down a road with no end in sight.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.539
After the Solo Olympics, I was devoted to practice.

00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:28.000
It was then that my younger sister, Rie, who had become one of Jehova's witnesses,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.440
gave me the happiness book.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.260
I really agreed with what that book said.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.300
In 1989, I started to study the Bible seriously.

00:40:43.679 --> 00:40:48.880
Even so, I just wasn't able to believe in the existence of a creator.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.719
So I studied the creation book.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.280
When I read about the structure of bird's wings, my eyes were opened.

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:02.320
I thought, there is a creator.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.760
The creator made this.

00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:12.780
When I was convinced of the existence of the creator, I was able to understand the purpose of life.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.619
It's just as Ecclesiastes 12 says.

00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:22.940
The purpose of life is to know the creator and live for him.

00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:27.869
I was so relieved.

00:41:29.469 --> 00:41:35.630
In 1991, I dedicated my life to Jehova and started on the creator's road.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.179
The following year, I started pioneering.

00:41:41.179 --> 00:41:45.019
And my sister and I moved to a congregation where the need was greater.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.059
But later, I was found to have kidney cancer.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:57.059
And in 2005, I had to quit pioneering after 13 wonderful years.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.150
I was really discouraged.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.710
I could no longer do the things I had always done,

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.429
and it was difficult to keep myself respect.

00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:17.329
However, at that time, timely publications and encouragement from the elders gave me good support.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.690
So I tried to find joy in what I could do.

00:42:24.929 --> 00:42:27.570
Later, I got my strength back to some extent.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.170
And I started pioneering again in 2012.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.289
I was overjoyed to attend Pioneer Service School again.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.340
Jehova really helped me to continue on this road.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:52.099
In this system, we think we have a lot of time in our lives, but in reality, we don't.

00:42:54.099 --> 00:42:59.460
People should live thinking about what is really important in life in the time they have.

00:43:03.059 --> 00:43:05.860
Of course, we can learn from the things we experience.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:13.539
But the wise course is to learn from the truth and from our relationship with our creator.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.619
I really want young people to learn that lesson.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:27.550
The road with real value is not the one we take for ourselves.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.750
It is the road we take for the creator.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:45.179
Even if we, as individuals, may not have the circumstances to serve where the need is greater,

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.940
pioneer, or work on a branch construction project,

00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:52.539
there is still a lot we can do in our local congregations.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:58.139
By displaying a pioneer spirit, all of us can be generous to our neighbors.

00:43:59.019 --> 00:44:03.579
This is highlighted in this music video entitled Now is the Time.

00:44:03.579 --> 00:47:02.769
Many examples of generosity we've seen this month truly highlight the value of Jesus' words

00:47:02.769 --> 00:47:05.650
as quoted in Acts chapter 20 verse 35.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:10.929
There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:47:10.929 --> 00:47:14.769
A thought I personally appreciated was to ask myself from time to time.

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:20.289
Would others in my family or my congregation view me as being a generous person?

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:26.610
Yes, we all want to reflect Jehovah's personality, to become imitators of God.

00:47:28.449 --> 00:47:33.170
To conclude the program, we would like to share these greetings from our brothers and sisters in

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:39.250
Guam. Guam is a territory of the United States located in the Western Pacific Ocean.

00:47:39.809 --> 00:47:44.210
There are nine congregations in Guam with 742 publishers.

00:47:44.849 --> 00:47:48.210
This includes 109 regular pioneers.

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:52.210
Earlier this year, a special meeting was held in connection with the branch visit.

00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:56.849
Brother Leon Weaver from World Headquarters gave an encouraging talk entitled

00:47:57.409 --> 00:48:03.730
We Are A Spectacle. Soon thereafter, our brothers and sisters in Guam had an opportunity

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:09.170
to show generosity towards their fellow witnesses on the island of Chuk, which was hit by Typhoon

00:48:09.409 --> 00:48:13.730
Mesact. Clothing and food items for several months duration were donated.

00:48:15.679 --> 00:48:18.320
We pray Jehovah's blessing be upon all of them.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:25.360
Thank you for joining us this month. This is J.W. broadcasting in Brooklyn, New York.
