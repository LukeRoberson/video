Sharks have skin that protects them in a unique way.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.269
Left unchecked, microorganisms would establish colonies on the shark's skin,

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:25.679
which in turn would attract larger parasites to latch onto the shark.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.679
If that happened, the shark's health and ability to swim would suffer,

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:39.689
but the fact is that the shark's skin remains virtually free of parasites.

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:48.700
How? Shark's skin is covered in complex scales called dermal tentacles.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.579
Though they look like tiny fish scales, they are built more like mammal teeth

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.579
with a smooth enamel surface.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.829
This very smooth surface, together with a complex structure of tiny ridges,

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:10.829
makes it very hard for microscopic organisms to grab onto the shark's skin.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:20.209
If one does latch on, those same ridges channel water to flow faster and wash off the hitchhiker.

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:25.209
So this single design element resists parasites in two different ways.

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:28.579
But that's not all.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.579
The tentacles' unique shape creates small areas of suction all along the shark's body,

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.579
enhancing its ability to thrust itself forward as it swims.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:48.579
These advantages allow sharks, like the short fin mako, to reach burst speeds of 74 kilometers per hour.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:56.079
Scientists are engineering artificial surfaces that mimic shark skin,

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.079
to help boats and planes be more fuel efficient.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.080
This nature-inspired technology could also prevent harmful germs from growing on hospital surfaces,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.900
without having to use toxic disinfectants.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900
What do you think?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900
Did sharks can simply evolve?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.900
Or was it designed?
