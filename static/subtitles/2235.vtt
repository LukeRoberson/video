00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.500
We now have been using the simplified edition of the Watchtower for some months, and as a family

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.780
we have to say we really find it much easier and much more enjoyable to read.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:29.000
For our son, Maxi's 12 years, we could see that he seemingly understood also the standard

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
edition.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.600
There were many terms and many concepts we had to explain, and they are now very clearly

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.600
explained.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.679
Since we've been using the simplified Watchtower, our family study has been much more fun,

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.600
and I feel that I really understand the articles much better now.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.479
This really helps me give good comments at the meetings in my own words, and when I understand

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.600
it better, then I can also explain it to others when preaching.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.640
We also see for our son, Mike, he is five years old now, that he's much more engaged.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.439
It makes it more likely to study for him.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.359
He can actually remember much better what the article was about.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:17.719
We can see that our preparation for the Watchtower with the simplified edition, that it really

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.079
helps us to reach our voice hearts, and we can see that it helps them to grow spiritually.
