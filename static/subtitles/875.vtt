00:00:10.380 --> 00:01:09.640
So that's the end of lesson 22. Take a look at this week's goal.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.079
Think of one person with whom you could share the good news. Think about what to say,

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.439
how to say it and when to say it. Isn't that technically three goals? You'll

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:29.659
do great. Let's close with a prayer. Well, Jocelyn wants me to do this

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:38.379
meditation seminar. You guys are into that, right? Well, we were. But I'm like, I can't

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:43.379
deal with that right now. With everything happening in the world, inflation is

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:50.129
killing my business. I just have bigger problems to think about. But what's bigger

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:57.890
than inner peace? Making payroll. Your brother is a Neanderthal. Look, it's not

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:11.699
my fault the world's amass. What do you guys think? So, what did you say? We

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:19.699
totally froze. It's a big step to share what you've learned. It's just for us. Our

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:26.509
spirituality's always been, you know, personal. We've never liked the idea of

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:32.310
pushing our beliefs on others. I know we're not pushing for it. We used to feel

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.710
the same way. I didn't think I could ever preach. I didn't even like the word

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.870
preach. How did you get over it? Well, the more we studied, the more we came to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.469
realize that when Jesus said go and make disciples, he was talking to us. It's the

00:02:53.469 --> 00:03:00.710
work that Jesus gave each one of us personally. Sometimes it feels like it's

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:08.990
too much for us. Well, it is too much for justice. But do you remember what

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:18.069
Jesus promised next? I am with you. Exactly. And he knew that sometimes it would

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:26.229
be hard. But we have some very powerful help. Here's some homework. Take a look at

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:35.419
Revelation chapter 14 and verse 6. And I saw another angel flying in mid-

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:40.460
heaven. We need everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth.

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.740
And this is neat point in the research guide. It says that a God's angels do not

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.699
preach directly to people. I'm so glad like God has to do this homework. I didn't

00:03:52.699 --> 00:04:02.090
realize mid- heaven means overhead. Help is so close. Yeah, they're right there

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:42.129
with us. Are you sure you have time for that before service? Almost done. Who

00:04:42.129 --> 00:05:20.259
taught you electrical? The internet. Hit it. Try that. Let there be light. Amazing.

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:28.980
Sorry about today. I know we haven't been on much lately. It's just our schedule. We

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.379
work all week plus meetings and family worship. And on the weekends these house

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:40.899
projects just kind of take over. You've got a lot on your plate. But we know that

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:49.379
ministry is important. Jesus gave us this work to do. Right. But do you think

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:55.620
there's more to our preaching than just this work we need to do? Well it's also

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.540
how we show love for people. That's true too. You know there's a Bible example

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:12.129
that really helped me. Notice what it says right here. He encouraged me to

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:24.860
meditate on how Paul described his ministry at Romans chapter 15 in verse 16. I am

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.779
engaging in the holy work of the good news of God. So to Paul his ministry wasn't

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:41.180
just work. It was the holy work of the good news. Exactly. His ministry wasn't

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:48.220
something Paul did in addition to his worship. It was a part of his worship. It was

00:06:48.220 --> 00:07:26.660
one of the ways he showed how much he really loved Jehovah. I like that. Here's the

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.620
question. Do you think God hears our prayers? Is that something that you've

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:39.540
wondered about? Good morning. We're asking our neighbors a question. Do you think God hears our prayers?

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:46.500
But does God hear our prayers? Have you ever wondered that? Psalm 652 answers the

00:07:46.500 --> 00:08:05.180
question. It says, I've got to try something different. A person will be more likely to

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:11.870
listen to our message if he senses that we care about him. Do you think people sense out

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.750
about us? Or do they just see a guy trying to plow through a scripture and hand them something?

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:25.069
Well this is what I need to work on. Empathize with the person. Try to imagine how he feels.

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:31.550
When I'm nervous, I'm thinking more about how I feel, not how they feel.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:42.620
Me too. I like this part. Be helpful. Acts of kindness can open the door to a conversation.

00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:53.840
So it's not so much what we say, but finding a way to show who we are. Maybe we can try that

00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:11.009
this weekend. Dispreparing. Focus on whoever's behind the door instead of myself.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:18.929
I was thinking about family worship too. You know, we've always cared about people.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:24.690
We just have to let us show. Let's pray for Jehovah to help us do that.

00:09:26.289 --> 00:09:42.350
Dear Father, Jehovah, come to you now. Good morning. Oh, I see you got your hands full.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:49.470
Yeah, I hope water heater. I feel your pain. I was broke last month. We'll let you get back to it.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:55.549
Thank you. Last week, the roof. Next, the furnace. Our fixer uppers full of surprises too.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.070
My name is Aiden. This is my wife, Ellie. I'm Ross. Nice to meet you, Russ.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:06.830
Both the hot water heater. I found some videos online that saved me hours. I can pull them up.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.470
It's okay. I think I've got this, but thank you. So what's this all about anyways?

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:18.990
Well, we live nearby and we've been volunteering to share something that's really helped us as a family.
