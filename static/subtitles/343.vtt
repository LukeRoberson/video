00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:06.169
How can we be sure that we will give a word at the right time?

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:14.169
Well, one of the things that will help us is described by the Apostle Paul in the book to the first letter to the Corinthians.

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:20.170
If you turn with me please to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 25.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.170
Notice what Paul says to them,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.170
so that there should be no division in the body,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.170
but its members should have mutual concern for one another.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.170
So notice that comment there,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.170
mutual concern for one another.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170
If you look at the interlinear,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.170
you'll notice that literally the Greek says there to be anxious over one another.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.170
And it's interesting also for us to note that this Greek word translated here,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.170
a mutual concern,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.170
is the same basic word that's used in the book of Matthew

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.170
when recording what Jesus said about not being anxious about anything.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.170
So that seems a little unusual, doesn't it?

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.170
Jesus tells us not to be anxious,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.170
and yet Paul here tells us to be anxious for one another.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
How does that work?

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.170
Well, obviously this word has different meanings or different connotations in different settings.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.170
It's wrong for us to be anxious about material things,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.170
particularly if it shows the lack of faith on our part.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.170
But on the other hand,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.170
it's appropriate that we should be anxious or show concern,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.170
a wholesome concern that motivates us to action when we're dealing with our brothers and sisters.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.170
If you turn over to the book of Philippians,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.170
you'll notice that Paul uses the same Greek word when describing Timothy,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.170
a Philippians chapter 2 and verse 20.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.170
There he says,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.170
Well, I have no one else of a disposition like his

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.170
who will genuinely care for your concerns.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.169
So this expression genuinely care,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.169
the care part of it is the same Greek word

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.169
about being anxious for others.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:22.169
And of course, that's the same Greek word that Paul used in Philippians chapter 4, verse 6,

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.169
where he said,

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.169
do not be anxious over anything.

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.169
Now at this point, you're probably thinking,

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:32.169
how does this all work?

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.169
The same Greek word, and yet we're told not to be anxious,

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.169
and yet at the same time,

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.169
we're told to be anxious for one another.

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:45.169
Well, maybe we could illustrate it with the English word jealousy.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:50.169
Normally, the connotation we would get from the word jealousy is something negative.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.169
But in certain situations or circumstances,

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.169
you can have a positive or proper description.

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.169
Perhaps let's take a husband or a wife

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:08.169
who finds out that their mate is starting to have a wrong, romantic attachment to someone else.

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:13.169
Well, shouldn't they have a feeling of jealousy if they don't, there's something wrong?

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.169
So in that situation, jealousy is positive.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.169
Well, in a similar way,

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.169
it's wrong for us to be anxious about material things,

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.169
trying to get ahead in the world and so on.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.169
But it's appropriate that we have a wholesome,

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:35.169
positive anxiety or concern for one another.

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.169
So what is this positive wholesome concern?

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.169
Well, first of all, let's say what it isn't.

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.169
First, Peter chapter four and verse 15.

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.169
You can talk on that later, but I'm sure you remember.

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.169
It says, we should not be a busy body.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.169
So this anxious concern doesn't mean

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:58.169
that we're trying to find out everything about this person.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.169
Then also, first Timothy chapter five and verse 13,

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:07.169
speaks of gossipers, medallers, and other people's affairs.

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.169
So if we were to be anxious in that regard,

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.169
that would be negative.

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.169
It wouldn't be appropriate, wouldn't it?

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:22.170
So how can we show this wholesome concern or anxiety for one another?

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.170
Well, over the years, the watchtowers made many comments on this,

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.170
but perhaps we could say there are four different things that we could do

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.170
that would show this mutual concern.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.170
The first one is to take personal interest in others.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.170
Yes, genuine interest.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.170
Not just asking them how are you and not waiting for an answer,

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.170
but trying to see what's happening in their lives

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.170
and show concern for them.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.170
The second way is by noting things that they do or say

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.170
that we can commend and then encourage them.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.170
So looking for opportunities to encourage one another

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.170
is another way that we show that we have this mutual concern.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.170
The third way that was mentioned in our text comments this morning

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.170
is that we need to try and see the potential in others for good.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.170
We can think of the example of Barnabas.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.170
Remember, Mark disappointed both Barnabas and Paul

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.170
during the first missionary journey.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.170
And yet Barnabas didn't give up on him.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.170
He saw there was some potential there for Mark to be better,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.170
to be used in a more interesting way in the future.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.170
So Barnabas encouraged that quality in Mark.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.170
And of course, we realized what the result was.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.170
Later Mark was very useful, not only to Barnabas,

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.170
but also to Paul.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.170
Of course, he had the privilege of writing in the count of Jesus' life.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.170
So what a wonderful privilege he had.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.170
So like Barnabas, we need to look at younger ones, newer ones,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.170
and even everybody to see if we can see potential for improvement

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.170
and then encourage them to be able to reach out for further activity.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.170
The fourth point we'd like to mention is the need for us

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.170
to show confidence in others.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.170
And the Apostle Paul was a good example of this.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.170
If we take our Bibles and turn to the book of Hebrews,

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.170
then you remember when Paul was writing to the Hebrew Christians,

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.170
there were many things he had to mention that were negative.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.170
For example, some were drifting away.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.170
They were distracted.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.170
Others had allowed their hearts to harden.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.170
Yet others really were still immature when it came to Christian living.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.170
They were feeding as it were on the milk of the Word.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.170
They couldn't eat properly in a spiritual sense.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.170
So those things could have perhaps played on Paul's mind

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.170
and perhaps he could have become quite negative.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.170
But notice in Hebrews chapter 10, and verse 39,

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.170
what Paul says to these brothers and sisters.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.170
Hebrews 10, verse 39.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.170
Now we are not the sort who shrink back to destruction,

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.170
but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.170
Isn't that a positive comment?

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.170
A positive comment made to those who perhaps were neglecting

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.170
to do certain things that they should have done.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.170
And we notice that too that Paul says now we are not the sort.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.170
So he includes himself along with these other brothers.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.170
How could Paul have such confidence when writing to those

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.170
who needed such a lot of counsel?

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.170
Well, the watch down made two points.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.170
It said, first of all, Paul tried,

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.170
he endeavoured to imitate the viewpoint of Jehovah God.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.170
Jehovah looks at imperfect humans.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.170
He sees their potential.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:10.170
And he has confidence that if they want to do what's right

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.170
with his help, they'll be able to do it.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:19.170
And the second area that Paul was able to trust in was Holy Spirit.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.170
He realized that with Holy Spirit,

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.170
someone can gain the power beyond what is normal

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:31.170
and overcome all sorts of fleshly desires and problems.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:36.169
So those two reasons then Paul's endeavouring to imitate Jehovah

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.169
and also his belief in the power of Holy Spirit helped him

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:46.169
to be confident, to be positive with regard to those brothers and sisters.

00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:50.169
So what can we see with regard to us giving a good word at the right time?

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:55.169
Well, we need to have neutral concern for one another.

00:08:55.169 --> 00:08:58.169
Not the type of concern that we're busy bodies or medallers

00:08:58.169 --> 00:09:00.169
and other people's affairs,

00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:02.169
but what with those four points?

00:09:02.169 --> 00:09:05.169
First of all, take personal interest in others,

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:09.169
commend and encourage them, see the potential in them for good,

00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:12.169
and then express confidence.

00:09:12.169 --> 00:09:16.169
If we do that, then we can be sure that in a positive way,

00:09:16.169 --> 00:09:19.169
each one of us is showing mutual concern.
