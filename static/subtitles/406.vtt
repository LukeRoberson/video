00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.459
It is interesting that Peter gives counsel about cultivating humility.

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:10.460
Let's turn the clock back and learn why the quality of humility was

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.460
indelibly etched in the mind and heart of Peter.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.460
Let's open our Bibles to Luke chapter 22.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.460
In Luke chapter 22, we'll find Jesus getting ready for that final pass

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.460
over in 33 CE and Luke 22, starting in verse 8,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.460
it is Thursday afternoon, nice in 13, what happens, verse 8.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.460
Jesus sent Peter, there he is, and John saying,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.460
go and get the pass over ready for us to eat.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.460
Get it ready, Peter, John 9.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.460
They said to him, where do you want us to get it ready?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
They understood the instructions, get it ready.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
Jesus said, going to Jerusalem, you'll find the man

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
with the earthenware jar, verse 12.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.459
And that man will show you a large furnished upper room,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.459
get it ready there, verse 13.

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:11.459
So they left and founded just as he had told them

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:15.459
and they prepared for the pass over.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:20.459
Get it ready, prepare the pass over.

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.459
What would that include?

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.459
Bread, wine, oil for the lamps,

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:35.459
lamb, towel, basin, water, basin and water.

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.459
They knew how important washing feet were.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:41.459
They witnessed when Jesus approved Simon the Pharisee

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.459
with a statement, Simon, you gave me no water for my feet.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.459
Simon, you gave me no water.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.459
You missed the mark on this one.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.459
So as they stared at that basin and water,

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.459
as they prepared and got the room ready,

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.459
did they look at each other and wonder,

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.459
who's going to wash the feet?

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.459
Who's going to do it?

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.460
They had a golden opportunity to apply all the things

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.460
that Jesus had been teaching them for three and a half years

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.460
on humility.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.460
This was the time, three and a half years.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.460
Conduct yourself as a lesser one.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.460
Don't lord it over others.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.460
You want to serve others and not be served.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.460
This was it.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.460
This was the time.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.460
They could have showed Jesus that they got the point.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.460
They got it.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.460
They had time to think about it, time to pray about it.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.460
It was Thursday afternoon.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.460
But now we progress and let's see what happens.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.460
Let's now progress to the evening and now it's nice and 14.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.460
Let's pick up the account in John chapter 13.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.460
They got the room ready.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.460
They followed the instructions.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.460
And now let's go to John 13.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.460
And get John's vantage point from this.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.460
He was there.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.460
He was with Peter getting it ready.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.460
So now it's 98 CE and John is writing this information.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.460
He had time to reflect and to think about this for years.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.460
And now look what he says in verse three.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.460
So Jesus.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.460
Knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.460
and that he came from God and was going to God.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.460
Knowing these things.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.460
He understood that.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.460
He sat back and said Jesus knew who he was.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.460
He knew all things.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.460
He had the full understanding of his dignity.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.460
He knew that he had been entrusted with all things.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.460
He knew.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.460
He knew he was the second greatest personage in the universe.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.460
He knew he was the first born of all creation.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.460
He knew he had shared with his father in creating all things.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.460
He had knowledge of all this knowing all these things.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.460
John sits back.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.460
He writes this.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.460
And then knowing this verse four.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.460
The contrast.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.460
He got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.460
taking a towel, wraps it around his waist.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.460
After that, he puts the water into the basin,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.460
starts to wash the feet of the disciples

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.460
and dry them off with the towel that was wrapped around him,

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.459
knowing who he was.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.459
John said he did this.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.459
But not only does John reflect on who Jesus was, no.

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:28.459
He reflects on why Jesus did it.

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:29.459
Why did he do it?

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:31.459
That's what John was interested in.

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:35.459
And we get that answer back in verse one.

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:38.459
Where John says why?

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:42.459
Because he loved his own that were in the world.

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:45.459
He loved them to the end.

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:48.459
John said he loved them to the end.

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:49.459
What does that mean?

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:53.459
He wanted to instill in them qualities that would help them conquer the world.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:56.459
Qualities that would strengthen the Christian congregation.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:00.459
Qualities such as unselfish love and humility.

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:02.459
He loved them to the end.

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:04.459
He never gave up on them.

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:08.459
He had no weaknesses, but he did not give up.

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:11.459
Now for Peter some 30 years later,

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:13.459
he's thinking about humility.

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:18.459
John some 60 years later after the lesson Jesus taught about humility,

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.459
it's echoing loud and clear in his mind and heart.

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:28.459
However, the fact remains that neither of them had the humility at the time

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:33.459
to apply what Jesus had been teaching them for three and a half years.

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:37.459
Now after John finished his writing,

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.459
he sits back, he was under inspiration, he finished that writing,

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:47.459
did he sit back, reread what he just wrote, perhaps he said to himself,

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.459
I wish I could have written.

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:56.459
After Jesus washed the feet of one or two of his disciples,

00:05:56.459 --> 00:06:01.459
I got up and washed the feet of the rest of my brothers.

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:06.459
I took that towel and I imitated the Christ.

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:12.459
Or Peter and I got up, but the point is they didn't.

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:14.459
What can we learn?

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:19.459
Don't allow valuable lessons that Jesus teaches us to echo in our minds

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:25.459
and hearts only after we miss the opportunity to apply them.

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:30.459
So in a practical setting for us serving here at Bethel,

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:36.459
although I know I have the seniority, I have full knowledge of my seniority

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:41.459
while I get up and fight the attitude of entitlement.

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:46.459
I know I have authority and trusted to me as the overseer,

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:50.459
I am the overseer, I know that, I have full knowledge of that.

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:55.459
Fine, will I get up and roll my sleeves back into the grunt work

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:59.459
or do I just find pleasure in giving orders?

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:03.459
I know, I have a wonderful privilege of service, I know that.

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:09.459
Others know it too, fine, but will I get up to train others?

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:13.459
Brother Jackson reminded us of this at the last Gilead graduation

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:18.459
when he said, treasure your privileges but don't hoard them.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:25.459
That means we have to get up, it takes humility to train others to take our place.

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:32.459
As a brother or a sister, I know I have more experience than the other person in my job.

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:38.459
I know I have the experience, I know that, I have more experience than my workmate.

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:46.459
Fine, but will I get up in all humility and share information that I have

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:53.459
with others to make their job easier or will I hold knowledge I have hostage?

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:59.459
If we get up in all humility and do these things, then we can say,

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:06.459
Jesus Humble Act as recorded here in John 13 has made a lasting and indelible impression

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:09.459
not only on Peter and John, but on me.
