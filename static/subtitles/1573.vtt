00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.039
Ms. Kwan? Ms. Kwan?

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.039
Sorry. Ms. Kwan?

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.699
I'm so slow today.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.699
It's okay. Take your time.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.050
So can you pine your next month?

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.050
No doubt, you will experience greater joy.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.489
Brother Choo.

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:31.489
Brother Choo.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.490
Yes, Mr. Kwan?

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.490
Can I have one too?

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.490
Of course. Just a moment, please.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.490
Brother Choo.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.490
I have many doctors appointments next month, but maybe.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.490
Oh, okay.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.490
Yeah.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.490
I wrote a little something that might help you when you fill it out.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.490
Oh, I see.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.490
Here you go.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.490
Thank you.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.490
And remember, our circuit over-serve visit isn't two months.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.490
And only 30 hours are required that month.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.490
I see. Brother Choo.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.490
Yes, hello, Brother Lee.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.489
Hello, Mr. Kwan.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.489
Hello, Brother Lee.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.489
Nice job covering those parts at the last minute.

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:12.489
Anyway, it seems like everyone is away.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.489
Hello, Mr. Kwan.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:16.489
Can I ask you to do something?

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:18.489
Here's what I need.

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:20.489
Hello, Mr. Choo.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:24.489
If you want to get something done, give it to a busy man.

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:26.489
We can always count on you.

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.489
Hannah and I were beginning to feel overwhelmed.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:30.489
Amen.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:35.209
Brother Choo.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.209
May I have a moment?

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.209
I need your help with something.

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.939
Then, Brother Kim needed help with the territories.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:57.219
Of course, we love being busy with theocratic work.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.219
Yes, Brother Kim?

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.219
Just a second.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.219
It's Brother Kim calling about the territories.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.219
I'll only take a minute.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.219
Yes.

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.219
Uh-huh.

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:10.219
I see.

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:12.219
Yes, I understand.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.219
Okay.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.219
Sounds good.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.219
Other more important things were beginning to suffer.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:28.569
It's like doctor's appointments are my whole life now.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.569
I have so many next months.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.569
And they take forever to reschedule.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.569
How could I possibly make my time?

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.569
There's something written here.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.569
Prayerfully consider 2 Corinthians 8-12.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.569
If the readiness is there,

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.909
oh, I am ready.

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.909
According to what a person has,

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.909
not according to what a person does not have.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.610
Jehovah wanted the Israelites to sacrifice their best.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.610
But just imagine what happened if they tried to do more than they could.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.610
I can almost hear the reaction.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.610
Dad, where'd all the sheep go?

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.610
All of them?

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.610
What are we supposed to live on?

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.610
No, he didn't want them to sacrifice so much

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.610
that they couldn't support their families.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.610
I need those appointments.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.610
But maybe in two months,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.610
when I don't have so many appointments

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.610
and the circuit overseer visit,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.610
I could set a goal.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.610
We knew we were taking on too much work.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.610
But could we say no?

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.610
We wanted Jehovah's view.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.360
What's so funny?

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.360
There's something I just shared with Sister Kwan.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.360
That is perfect for us, too.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.360
2 Corinthians 8-12.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.360
According to what a person has.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.360
Just like our financial contributions.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.360
Exactly.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.360
Honey, would Jehovah want us to get into debt

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.360
to make a huge contribution we couldn't afford?

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.310
You know, that scripture we just read.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.490
But there came a say, young.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.490
Territories again?

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.490
Yes.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.490
But I'll tell him that I'll call him after family worship.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.959
We can't give what's not ours.

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:35.959
And we can't let our spiritual routine suffer.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.959
Even for theocratic privileges.

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.959
Note this promise in the Bible.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:44.959
Look at this flower, isn't it beautiful?

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:48.959
I love this time of year.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:52.959
Thank you both so much for your help this month.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.959
It's so good to find the right balance.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:58.959
And to know we're giving Jehovah all we can.
