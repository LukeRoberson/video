00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:29.789
In this world it can be hard, not just to follow your heart, to be different, into what's right, but your hover tells us in his world.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:39.299
Don't be molded by this worldly promises life in paradise.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:52.619
So stand tall, give your rovers right there with you.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:01:10.870
He won't let you fall, and pray day to climb those mountains out there, standing in your way.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:31.159
Hold only for the day, but forever we'll try and offer fame.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:39.400
Put a spotlight on your name, crazy route to sea.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:58.420
But rather than strive to win, your hover says reach out to him, he promises life in paradise.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:11.250
So stand tall, give your rovers right there with you.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:27.780
He won't let you fall, and pray day to climb those mountains out there, standing in your way.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:03:22.879
Hold only for the day, but forever we'll try and offer fame.
