00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:11.089
I enjoyed learning about Jehovah and the Paradise, so at an early age I came to love Jehovah.

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:19.100
Yet later on, doubts just started nagging away at me.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:27.859
I was deeply troubled by all the horrible pain and suffering I saw on the nose.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.740
Even though I knew and understood the sovereignty issue, I kept asking myself, why is it taking

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.859
so long?

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.939
I even started feeling a distance growing between me and Jehovah.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:49.140
I did a lot of praying and studying during that time.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.079
Mark and I also had many deep and meaningful conversations.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:04.219
Then I saw a picture in the publications of a father carrying his little son on his shoulders.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.900
That really resonated with me.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.540
I wanted that same kind of trust that a child has in his father.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.019
To feel that I could trust Jehovah without asking questions.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:24.939
It became a real struggle between what I mentally understood and what I was feeling emotionally

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.819
in my heart.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.859
I remember earnestly praying to Jehovah so that I could feel things as Jehovah feels

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.129
them.

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:38.250
At a certain point, an elder came to visit us.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.890
He specifically asked me, Edith, how are you doing?

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:54.019
His interest and concern just made me open up and tell him what I was struggling with.

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:57.659
I remember he quoted a scripture.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:08.699
It was at 2 Corinthians 10 verse 5 where it says, we must bring wrong thoughts into captivity.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.219
I came to realize that our way of thinking is often so limited.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.139
Jehovah sees everything.

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.340
He takes all factors into consideration.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.219
As a result, those negative feelings couldn't grow and get stronger.

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.379
Now I could focus on positive thoughts.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.259
That was the turning point.

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:39.659
I felt like Jehovah had literally held out his hand and pulled me up out of a deep hole

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.060
and put me back up high and gave me a new start.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.060
Jehovah is not indifferent.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.900
His love is the exact reason why he's waiting so patiently.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.419
It's also helped me to be more patient with others.

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:05.780
Jehovah has given me the time and the opportunity to break out of that vicious circle.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.340
And with his help, I succeeded.
