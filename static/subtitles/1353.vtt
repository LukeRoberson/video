00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:09.230
In busy harbours around the world, witnesses invited to this special work are going aboard ships with the Kingdom message.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:41.659
It's a 24-7 economy, so you never know exactly when a ship arrives.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.659
You have to be flexible in your schedule.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.659
Just everything you can to meet the people there on board, especially when it is a return visit.

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.659
You try to do everything you can to meet that person again.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.659
We check one website where all the ships are depicted on a map.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.659
We check if some of them are return visits.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.659
What nationalities are on board?

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.659
Once on the ship we go to the master room and then it's a little bit like a metropolitan witnessing.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.659
We have like a table and we play some magazines over there.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.659
We put a tablet over there with the website.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:28.659
In the 80s we used a little cart behind our bicycles to bring all the 80 languages of literature to the sea ships.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.659
Sometimes we would come home tired at 10.30, maybe 11.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.659
And then there was a message on the answering machine of a sailor saying,

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.659
please Mr. Tideman, come to our ship because we're leaving in two or three hours and we desperately need spiritual food.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.659
And we would go right back on our bikes with literature.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.659
But in the winter time it was very hard because it was raining, it was very cold.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.659
And we had to bike for one hour.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:07.909
But then we came on the ship and then people were so nice and you were inside and then we could forget it.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.909
The JW Language app also proves very valuable in our ministry.

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.909
When we have to wait for example in the master room for the crew to arrive,

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.909
we use it to practice certain greetings or expressions in their motor tongue.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:28.909
The biggest challenge for us in the Harbourfield is a little bit like what I call the five minutes rule.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.909
What will you say if you meet a person once in your life and you only have five minutes?

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.909
So what we have to do then is read a scripture, inform him about God's name,

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.909
give him a beautiful tract, show him a video,

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.909
all focus on the first five minutes and meet a person.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:55.909
And if we see how they react to Jehovah's purpose to make this earth a paradise again

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.909
and that they would be able to be with their families, that is Jehovah's intention from the start.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.909
That is very nice to see how they are comforted by the good news.

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.909
I have seen so many times how Jehovah cares for the sailors, how he helps them,

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.909
how he listens to their prayers.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.909
Sometimes when I was coming from the ship, I couldn't sleep from all the excitement on the ship.

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.909
These are really the most beautiful years of my life.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:33.439
I first got in touch with the trophy 1997 at Antwerp Harbour in Belgium.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.439
When Prada Teni and Sister Nancy Scurry visited me.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.439
One of the topics that touched his heart was the good news of the kingdom.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:50.439
And I remember once he told us that his personal name, Tal-Alele, means good news.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.439
He applied promptly with the alerts in his personal life,

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.439
and shortly thereafter he became an empathized publisher.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.439
And after some time he preached with us together on the ships.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.439
My love for the truth and the brotherhood got stronger.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.439
I was baptized in 2000.

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:16.360
I now saving as a special pioneer on the island of Savai in Samoa.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:56.379
I am grateful that the brothers who visited us at the talk carried out Jehovah's Witnesses with zealously and faithfully.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:02.379
These brothers learn that harbour witnessing takes good planning and an adaptable spirit.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:07.379
If there is a seaport in your area that could benefit from this form of ministry,

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:13.379
ask your congregation service committee what arrangement exists or it could be set up by your branch.
