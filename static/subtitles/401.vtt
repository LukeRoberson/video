00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.250
There's no doubt that Jesus was the great teacher, and there were many reasons for that, but

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.250
one of them is that he really understood the people that he was dealing with.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.250
He knew what was really inside.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.690
Now he had God-given ability to actually read hearts, but he also had abilities that

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:33.409
they got from his father as well, such as insight, discernment, understanding, wisdom, and

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:37.009
all of this combined to make him an outstanding teacher.

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:44.009
Well, obviously we can't read hearts, but we can imitate Jesus and developing the qualities

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:50.850
that will help us to be the most effective in helping others, for example, insight.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.130
How would you define it?

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:01.289
It's the ability to see into a situation, to act with discretion, to be successful.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.810
It means not just looking at the obvious, but going deeper.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.930
It's related to understanding, understanding is the ability to distinguish different components

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.930
of a subject or situation, but insight goes further.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.530
It's an intelligent knowledge of the reason, in other words, it answers the question, why?

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.769
Why is this happening?

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:36.329
Or why would I say what I'm about to say, because that's the best thing to say?

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.450
It's related also to discernment.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.290
That's being keen in judgment, perceiving differences, being able to see what appears

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.250
to be one way, but may not be that way at all.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.209
And it helps to identify the true needs of a person or the real problem.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.730
Now, to illustrate how the use of these qualities can be very helpful.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.609
Suppose someone in the congregation comes to you and says, I'm really having a problem

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.090
controlling the temper, I'm getting angry.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.650
So now right away we may think, and rightfully so, well, I have a number of scriptures

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.250
that I can share with you about controlling anger, controlling the tongue, not letting

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.770
you bad thing come out of our mouth, and those are excellent.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.530
But the teacher or the helpful counselor that will do the best good would want to do what.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.530
He'd want to ask the question, why?

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.849
Why are you getting angry?

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.770
Can you pinpoint it?

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.250
Are you feeling well?

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.490
Have you not gotten enough rest?

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.689
Is there a catalyst at work, at school, in the congregation, at home?

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:57.129
And then after determining why the most effective scriptures and the most encouragement can

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.409
be given?

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.530
And where do we get these qualities of insight, discernment, understanding?

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.930
Well, they come from Jehovah, don't they?

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.330
John 32.8 says, I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.530
And he does that through his word, but also through his organization.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.250
Jeremiah 3.15 says, and I will give you shepherds after my own heart, and they will feed

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.810
you with knowledge and insight.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.009
So we're blessed to have Jehovah's Word at the Faithland Discrete Slave to assist us

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.009
to gain these qualities.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.930
And how will it help us?

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.610
Open your Bible, please, to Psalm 119, and let's read together, verse 99.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.289
Psalm 119, verse 99.

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:57.409
I have more insight than all my teachers, because I ponder over your reminders.

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:04.449
Now, you notice the Psalmist did not say, I can quote more scriptures than anybody else.

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.129
And I can answer all the difficult Bible questions, no problem.

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.090
No, in this context, he says, I have more insight.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.649
Jehovah has given me the ability to see beyond the obvious in myself and also in my ability

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.850
to help someone else.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.529
Well, how do we learn to display this?

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:35.370
Well, we go back to our exemplar Jesus, and we start with his approach to people.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.050
Warm, kind, affectionate, compassionate, empathetic.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:49.649
And when a person conveys that spirit, those that he is trying to help, they feel comfortable,

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:55.009
and they're more likely to reveal what may be in their heart.

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:01.730
So with that fine approach, Jesus was able to put himself in others situation, to have

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:10.129
empathy and compassion, for example, with Martha and Mary at the time of Lazarus death.

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:16.370
So we can appreciate, can't we, that that is a critical element of being insightful,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.009
making others feel comfortable.

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.930
But then what else can we do to find out what's really in a person's heart?

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.209
We can't read it.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.970
Well, let's open our vivals to the Procure Proverbs, chapter 20.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.529
Proverbs, chapter 20, and let's look at verse 5.

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:43.009
The thoughts of a man's heart are like deep waters, but the diserning man draws them out.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.050
So how does he do that?

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.529
By questions, he seeks knowledge.

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:58.689
He gathers facts in line with Proverbs 15, 14, where it talks out the wise one, the understanding

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.810
one seeks knowledge.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:10.970
So he doesn't answer before he has all the facts, and he uses tactful and respectful questions.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.449
But he doesn't probe to the point of embarrassment unnecessarily.

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:23.649
And he realizes that point blank questions, blunt questions, may give him an answer, but

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:31.050
they can be very harmful, especially if they insinuate a suspicion of wrongdoing without

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.810
any warranting of that.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.410
Such questions may cause deep wounds, as described at Proverbs 12, 18, thoughtless speech

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:48.329
is like the stabs of the sword, so respectful, gentle, meaningful questions.

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:55.410
And then listen, swift about listening, slow about speaking according to James, and

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.290
not overreacting to what they may say.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.290
We have an effect.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.410
Ask them, please tell us, how do you feel about this or what's happening?

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:11.139
And if they tell us, we can't get mad at them because we ask them.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.139
So there's a time to be quiet.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:20.660
We ask a meaningful, tactful question, and an ecclesiastes three, seven applies, a time

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.060
to be silent, and a time to speak.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.699
Now not talking too much helps us another way, because Proverbs 10, 19 says, when words

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:38.819
or many transgression cannot be avoided, but whoever controls his lips acts discreetly.

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:44.899
So there's this matter of being cautious with how much we talk, especially before we have

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:46.300
all the facts.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:53.339
We want the complete picture with thoughtful questions, and then we can be able to assist.

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:58.139
And if they say something, we want to be careful that we don't overreact.

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:02.139
It's insightful, and it shows discernment, not to overreact.

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:05.180
And here's an illustration of that.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:13.259
A Christian couple noticed that their daughter was withdrawing from family association.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:16.779
She would isolate herself and want to be by herself.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:20.939
So they gently questioned her, trying to find out what's happening.

00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:23.699
She never would open up.

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:27.259
They kept up kindly, patiently.

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:31.620
And one day the mother went into the daughter's bedroom, sat down, put her arm around her

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:37.019
daughter and said, honey, tell me what's happening.

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:43.980
So she said, well, mom, I don't feel like that you and the rest of the family like my

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.460
company.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.820
So I'm staying away as much as possible.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:55.740
So now the mother's first reaction she reported, the mother said, I wanted to say that is

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.779
absolutely ridiculous.

00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:05.919
But then I held it in, she said, and I listened, and she poured out her heart.

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:07.519
She got better.

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:13.039
The family made some adjustments, and in time this fine young woman went into the full-time

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.679
service.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.840
But let's think back.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.799
What if the mother had not used discernment and insight when her daughter told her what

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:26.080
the problem was, and she did say, that's ridiculous.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.679
What would that have done to the daughter?

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:33.000
Well, now you think I'm stupid.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And I'm ridiculous.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.720
Well, that really helps a lot.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.720
Thank you very much.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.759
I feel even more willing to be with you folks now.

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:43.840
Well, it would have happened that way, perhaps.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.360
But it does show the value of listening and not or reacting to get really what's in a

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.600
person's heart.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.240
And when they tell us, we respond accordingly.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.360
So in imitation of Christ, we want to know what's inside people so that we can help them

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.360
the most.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.480
But we do that by relying on insight and discernment that Jehovah gives us, and by being compassionate

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.200
and caring and kind, and probing gently to find out what the real problem is, so we can

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.360
use the most effective scriptures to help them for that particular problem.
