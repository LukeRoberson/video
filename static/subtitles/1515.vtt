00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.449
The ancient road from Jerusalem to Jericho likely followed a path similar to that of the modern road, one shown here.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:21.449
Roman Jericho, two, was located where the road emerged from the wilderness of Judea.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:32.140
The site of the Canaanite city of Jericho, three, was located nearly two kilometres or just over one mile from the Roman city.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:42.450
Shown here is what a short section of the road looks like today as you travel east toward the city of Jericho.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:54.450
The ancient road was over 20 kilometres or 12 miles long and had a steep one kilometre or 0.6 mile descent as it wound from Jerusalem to Jericho.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:03.450
Ratheries in this wild and lonely terrain were so frequent that a garrison had to be stationed there to protect travelers.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:18.120
Where the road emerges from the wilderness, you see two, the site of Roman Jericho, and three, the site of the Canaanite city of Jericho.
