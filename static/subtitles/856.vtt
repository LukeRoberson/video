00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:21.769
The governing body has prayerfully considered how Jehovah's mercy could be better reflected

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.050
when dealing with wrongdoers in the congregation.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.450
In his love, Jehovah wants sinners to become reconciled to him if at all possible.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.689
He doesn't want anyone to be destroyed, so he appeals to them to repent.

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:43.130
And we see these pictures, you know, illustrations about, might be a drawing or something that

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.929
shows a shepherd going after that one large sheep.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.490
And you think that's really nice, you know, in concept, don't that's good?

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.829
But it's not just an academic concept, it's reality.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.609
The fact that he loves people in this way, even those who've been removed from the congregation,

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.890
just gives me an opportunity to reflect that same love that Jehovah has and extend that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.409
to others as well.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.650
The elders in our circuit promptly responded to the adjustments.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.090
Once they heard the update, we got the printed direction, the brothers promptly met together.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.650
With the fellow elders, we all discuss how we can help all these ones in our territory

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.090
that have been removed from the congregation.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.090
And we visited them.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.409
They were grateful that they were not forgotten.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.500
They are still remembered.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.900
This heartwarming to hear reports of how Jehovah has blessed congregation elders as they search

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.260
for those who have been removed from the congregation.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:54.500
For example, in the first four months after the 2024 governing body update number two,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.180
in the South Africa and Philippines branch territories combined, more than 1,200 have

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.019
come back to the congregation.

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:11.099
Here in the United States branch territory, over 5,000 brothers and sisters have been

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.300
welcomed back.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.099
In the Brazil branch territory, some 5,200 publishers have been reinstated, and in the

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:29.740
Central America branch territory, over 5,300 individuals have come back to the congregation.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.379
The numbers are exciting, but we can't overlook that each of these dear ones have returned

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.479
to Jehovah and Jehovah loves them.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:47.080
One man came to mind because he's deaf and blind, and he'd been away from Jehovah for

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.719
45 years.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.000
We prayed with him.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.120
We asked him where he was with things, and he said, I want to be back, I want to be back

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120
in the family.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.199
That was as what he said, he's been studying regularly and attending the meetings ever

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.199
since then.

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.080
And he was reinstated about a month later.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.439
So when I tacked that announcement for him that night, I said, you're back in the family.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.120
You're a Jehovah's witness again, and he was just overjoyed at that.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.879
There's a pioneer sister in our circuit that was asked to conduct a study with a young

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.199
mom who's trying to make her way back to Jehovah.

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.759
She was so excited after the first study.

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.240
She said that first study went so well.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.520
It seems like everyone in the congregation is very happy just to have this arrangement

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520
in place.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.759
A sister told me it made her so happy to see that young mom who's studying, smiling

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:40.759
again.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.879
She hadn't seen it in a long time.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:48.879
And one experience that is exciting is that this man has been removed for over 30 years,

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.520
but he started coming to the meetings early this year, but he would sit at the back and

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.280
not talk to anyone.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.120
But eventually, after this arrangement has been made available when we visited him, he

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.439
was so excited because he said, I didn't know what to do to come back to the congregation.

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.479
And here we are visiting him.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:15.840
And he says he felt like a heavyweight has been lifted off his shoulders.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.560
And he has been reinstated.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.959
A young man that I studied the Bible was who came into the truth under great difficulty.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:25.079
And so we thought of him immediately.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:31.560
And right away I sent him a message because I still had his phone number and said, please

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.360
watch this governing body update and I sent him the link.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.879
Well the next day I received a reply to this message and there was a photo of a letter

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:47.560
that he had written to the congregation body of elders asking to be reinstated.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.680
I wrote back very excitedly and said, have you actually watched the update?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.759
And he said, yes, since yesterday I've watched this update six times.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:05.480
Well of course our hearts were absolutely overflowing, but it was even, we were even happier

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.680
when about a month later he was writing us to say, I have finally been reinstated.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.920
The sister that was asked to conduct a study with a person and she says, the greatest gift

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.199
I've ever gotten is to study with someone who has been removed from the congregation.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:35.920
So her experience of crying was her telling her that she liked her bag and the student

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.720
says, I bought this bag years ago so I could go out and service when I got ready.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.759
When I was reinstated showed her that she had been trying for a long time to come back

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.600
but just did not know how.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.399
So the student now realizes that that was Jehovah, that is helping her and she feels

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.920
grateful to be helped to come back.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.480
By sitting on that Bible study with someone who was removed from the congregation

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.839
and seeing the benefit helped me to see the depth of Jehovah's mercy

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:17.360
because this young man has been removed from the congregation for nine years.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:23.759
He has wanted to come back, he mentioned, but he just didn't have the strength

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.920
to make steps to come back.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:34.279
One person had been removed from the congregation some 17 years ago and on his own

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.279
he was watching JW Broadcasting.

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.759
He saw the update.

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:50.139
He said, this is, it's time to come home.

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:57.259
And so he called the kingdom hall, he left a voicemail and the brothers received his message.

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.420
They reached right out to him.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:06.740
A Bible study was started and the very happily he's too has progressed, progressed to being

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:13.339
reinstated and his parents were able to fly in and be there at the kingdom hall that night.

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:15.339
He was reinstated.

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:18.379
He later said this is truly a homecoming.

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:26.839
I feel like it helps us to see another side of Jehovah as our father.

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:30.439
And you see how much he loves his children.

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:35.800
And then he allows us to have a part in helping them to come back to him.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.079
And so we get to reflect his mercy too.

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:41.480
That's such a privilege.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.199
Back in 1979, my father was removed from the congregation and I was eight.

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:56.839
You can grow up thinking, okay, maybe my dad will come back in a decade goes by.

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.040
Two decades goes by.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.720
Three decades goes by.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.519
And you don't want to lose hope.

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:09.000
But it does tend to make you think that maybe this person might not ever come back.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.040
I get a phone call and it's a friend of mine I've known for many years.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.079
He and another brother went to go see my dad.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:22.199
And he even accepted a study.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:33.210
At this point, I said, wow, I said, that's, that's great.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:43.690
Because most of my childhood and my entire adult life, I have not known a father who was serving Jehovah.

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:51.690
You should never, ever underestimate the lengths Jehovah will go to to save.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.590
One sheep.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.750
One sheep.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:12.110
So, yeah, it's, yeah, it's, uh, if you weren't a believer in Joe,

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:17.070
is Joe is mercy before, no one will ever be able to say when everything is over.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.909
And this is the things that Jehovah didn't care enough.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.590
He didn't make the efforts.

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:22.350
He didn't send anybody out.

00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:26.269
Uh, yeah, you can't, you really, you really can't say that.

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:33.070
Because Jehovah is making sure that the extra effort was made.
