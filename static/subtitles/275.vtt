00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.700
Our relationship with Jehovah can start when we're young.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.699
For me, it was the example that other set of putting Jehovah first

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.699
and the happiness that came as a result,

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.699
as well as being in that sort of environment

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.699
that really helped me to one reach out

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.699
as well as be available for those opportunities.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.699
And once we do give our life to Jehovah,

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.699
it's amazing to see the blessings that he has in store for us.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.699
But in order to build that relationship,

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.700
we need to read God's Word.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700
We also need to pray to Him.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.700
The more you get to know Him, the more appealing things you learn about Him

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
that makes you not want to lose Him as your friends.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.700
I always knew it was the truth and that I want to serve Jehovah forever,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.700
but I needed to reassure myself of certain aspects.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.700
So I did some research projects with my parents using their creator book

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
and some items from the Bible Teachbook.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
After that, it only became more of us.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700
And I was certain that I wanted it

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
and that I was ready to get baptized.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700
To strengthen my relationship with Jehovah,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.700
I read the Bible daily and I pray,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700
especially when there is no one around, or it's quiet,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.700
I talk to Jehovah with all my heart at that time.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Making myself available for spiritual opportunities

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700
was a little bit difficult for me at first,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.700
but I didn't give up.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.700
After my baptism, I became a ministerial servant

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
and I also served almost two years in Bethel.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.700
And now, I'm a regular pioneer in how to do

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.700
in a current speaking congregation.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700
I didn't know or speak the currency or language,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.700
so the local brothers helped me to learn not only how to speak,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700
but also how to read.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.739
Prayers are important to strengthen my relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.739
For me, it's like talking to a friend and that's always helpful.

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:01.739
He's someone real to me and I fully trust that he listens to me.

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.739
I support the elders by helping with the cleaning of the hall,

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:08.740
serving as an attendant, handling microphones,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.740
as well as helping the congregation spiritually.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.740
When I share Jehovah's promises of eternal life with others,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.740
I too am encouraged.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.740
I am constantly remembering what Jehovah promises

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.740
and that motivates me to keep preaching.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.740
There's a family in our congregation who took me into their home

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.740
and served as my spiritual parent.

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.139
Through our family worship,

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.139
they helped me to progress spiritually.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:51.939
The elderly ones in our congregation have been helping me a lot.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.939
First, they're good examples.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.939
They also remind me to keep my eyes simple.

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.939
Despite their limited circumstances because of age,

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.939
they are determined to serve Jehovah God,

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.939
and that made me reflect on my situation.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.939
I'm very young.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.939
What prevents me from doing the things that they do?

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.939
Before I began Pioneering, I used to selfish seven days a week,

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.939
but now I selfish four days a week,

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.289
so three days are available for Pioneering.

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.289
To be able to be available for spiritual opportunities,

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.289
I closely associate with my congregation.

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:36.080
I offer some older ones a ride to the meetings or in the preaching work.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.479
The reason I'm doing this is because I want to give my youth

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:47.780
an energy to Jehovah God.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.780
When I was at school, I would conduct Bible studies with some of my classmates.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.780
In time, they joined me in serving Jehovah.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.780
When I think about being with them in the future of Paradise,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.780
it gives me deep joy.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.780
I have the privilege of studying with a deaf girl,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.780
who leaves two hours from where I live.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.780
We have to walk all the way.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.780
She is very happy with what she's learning,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.780
and her family is very supportive.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.779
So knowing that Jehovah is helping her,

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.779
and I have a part in it, it's just priceless.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.779
Auxiliary Pioneering definitely helped me because it was like a stepping stone

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.779
to regular pioneering.

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:32.779
The ministry definitely gives you the opportunity to be able to work closely with Jehovah,

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:36.779
and then by doing that, you're reaffirming your faith in what you already believe in,

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.779
and then you're drawing closer to Jehovah in friendship.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:47.779
Having JW.org and the broadcast has definitely drawn me closer to our brothers and sisters,

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:49.779
but also Jehovah as well.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.779
Just by nature, I feel like I'm a more of a timid person,

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.779
so going door to door can be a little scary,

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:00.779
but seeing other young ones in different parts of the world that are enduring very difficult circumstances

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.779
and living conditions, and yet are still giving their best to Jehovah,

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:10.779
is so encouraging for me, and it helps me to keep going on and give Jehovah my best as well.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:18.779
When I think personally about all the avenues of service that we can have a hand in today,

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:25.779
there are so many that are exciting, whether it be pioneering in a foreign country,

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:30.779
serving where they need us great, even serving at Bethel.

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.779
Unless we taste and see that Jehovah is good,

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:37.779
unless we put ourself out there and are available to try that at least once,

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.779
we'll never know what it would be like to really serve Jehovah.

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.779
And in doing that, you will see how Jehovah does want the best life for us.
