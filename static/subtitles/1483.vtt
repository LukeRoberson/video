00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:50.789
Every one of us are well and happy. Every day we're still working away. And we feel

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.909
as Brother Russell has said, the Gentile times have ended and their kings have had

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:05.310
their day so we know not what awaits us. May you day by day keep close to the

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.310
master and his presence will so cheer you that nothing shall be able to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:38.019
dismay you. Edith Kessler October 11th 1914. At the Keenan's birth in 1914 the

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:42.659
Bible students were not exactly sure what was going to happen but they knew it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.180
would be a pivotal year. For decades they had been seeing that the Gentile

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.859
times were closing and that the kings had had their day and they had been

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.620
using every means available to focus attention on this monumental event.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.420
Newspapers had carried sermons to millions. Volunteer workers had

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.859
distributed millions of free tracks. Coal porters were zealously preaching

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:12.780
pilgrims were busy organizing congregations and a message was expanding

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.259
globally. But with the end of the Gentile times approaching so quickly how could

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:23.539
so few Bible students reach an entire world? How could they quicken the pace?

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:38.080
It is unanimously resolved to use moving pictures and teaching Bible truths.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.120
The Lord sanctioned this in his use of word pictures so this should not be

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.000
neglected. The Watch Tower July 1st 1913. With that resolution the Bible

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.840
students were galvanized to present the photo drama of creation but such a

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.639
mammoth undertaking would not come without challenges. Some of the young

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.560
brothers learned to operate to projection machine by volunteering at the local

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.879
theaters. Being too young I used to sit in the booth with the brother. I can

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.759
remember how exciting it was when a film caught fire. How the brother had to act

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:25.180
quickly to put it out and proceed with the performance. Dwight Kenyon.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.419
It was excellent. It was very amazing. You had individual back in those days that

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.379
were able to do that without modern instrument and it's very impressive.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.020
That's really what helped my father to come into the truth. They got to the

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.099
meeting the next day after it was finished and eventually started studying and

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.939
within a few months they were baptized. And my mom told me that she was one of the

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.340
usherettes when they put on the photo drama there in their town in Texas. But

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.379
they had little pictures postcard size of the pictures that were used the

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:03.259
slides and it was a joy to look at those from time to time when I was a kid.

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:08.340
Nine million people saw the photo drama during his first year. A precious

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.420
message they would not soon forget. And there was more to come. From every part

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.300
of the field has come the cry saying what more is there that we can do. The

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:30.660
result is a new magazine under the title The Golden Age. Joseph F. Rutherford.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.060
After that announcement brother Rutherford asked of everyone there how many

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:44.339
desire to do this work. Six thousand Bible students stood up as one. An

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.259
older next decade. The thousands who would participate in that harvest work would

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:55.939
use many creating methods to reach more people faster. Among them was a book The

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:02.139
Heart of God. People were encouraged to get the harp study course by mail. Then

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.459
when I went to the home of our service director his wife and I ran speed

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:12.300
races typing addresses on these cards. We sent out hundreds each week. Trudeau

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.300
McKittrick. Soon another technique would come to the fore. The radio station WBBR.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.500
The studio for this new radio broadcasting station was located in the attic. The

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.620
microphone that we used at the beginning was taken from an ordinary telephone.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.899
Finally after some weeks of preparations we were ready for the first broadcast.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:43.459
That occurred on Sunday evening February 24th 1924. The call letters were WBBR.

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:49.660
These call letters are enemies said meant wicked buzzes by radio. It was my

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.740
privilege to throw the power switch on for that first broadcast and away we

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.620
went hoping for the best Ralph Leffler. The peoples of this earth are now

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.180
numbered by the thousands of millions. Many of them. The WBBR in many

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.899
respect was a forerunner to the videos because we had Bible questions answered

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:14.300
there. We had public meetings. We had book studies. We had news. The first piece

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.180
of equipment that someone got when they came into the truth was a really good

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.819
radio. So they could hear WBBR. And that's like I mentioned earlier how my

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:28.459
parents first heard the truth was a radio discourse that a brother gave a

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:34.579
talk on where they did. I had the privilege of times of giving talks on the WBBR

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:42.220
young minister speaks. I gave that once or twice. I was encouraged to take part in

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:49.339
one of their Bible study groups. I was privileged to be on it. It was a program

00:06:49.339 --> 00:07:00.100
that was designed as a family Bible study. But even before that, quite a number of

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:11.060
years ago, Fred Franz was on WBBR. Imagine him on the air and youngsters listening

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:18.819
to him. Good evening boys and girls. I know it's drawing close to bedtime.

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:26.579
For many of you. But before you take yourselves to bed, I want to tell you a

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:32.300
story. I had never imagined I'd ever be on a radio program of any kind. And here I

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:38.699
was presenting the truth as a part of a program. So it was a real joy to be on WBBR.

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:44.540
The success of WBBR was met with increased opposition. So other methods were

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:52.420
used to keep spreading the kingdom message. When I was little, we never had an automobile

00:07:52.420 --> 00:08:02.180
in our home. But these sound cars, big, beautiful cars, but these big horns on top. And when

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:08.259
they broadcasted first music, everybody came out to listen. And ever weekend, some of

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:17.339
the what we would call today elders would bring the sound car in and station it in our yard.

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:21.779
And from there, they would play the records for the neighborhood. Every weekend, we had

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:26.660
a large group of people listening because of their location. They could stay and listen.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.059
And there was quite a gathering during that time.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.779
Another time I set up and started one of brother, brother for lectures, telling about

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:41.980
the second coming of Christ. A few days afterward, a person told me that his fellow moonshiner

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.940
was set up in the woods making a run of moonshine. When all of a sudden here came a voice

00:08:46.940 --> 00:09:03.659
from above, he got excited and went to run it. But it could not get away from the sound.

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:12.659
He finally ran home to get his axe and went back up there and chopped up his still. He

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:28.220
said he did not want the Lord to catch him making moonshine at his coming. See him personally.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:34.340
We would come up on a porch, open our case, set the arm in position on the record and

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:40.259
push the doorbell. When the householder opened the door, we would say, I have an important

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:44.620
message. I would like you to hear. And we would start the record. It is often said

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:50.620
that David is a snare and a racket. And why? When I was pioneering, I used the phonograph

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:57.299
all the time. I liked the phonograph. This is an upright phonograph. We had the type

00:09:57.299 --> 00:10:03.580
that opened up and you could balance it on your hip if you were strong enough or you set

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:09.460
it down on the porch and the message would be heard way down the street.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:18.179
And I always enjoyed hearing when I put the record on. Brother Rutherford saying, religion

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:24.379
is a snare and a racket. And I'd look at the expression on the face of the people, whether

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:31.700
they were happy or not. And I remember they told us now to help the householder concentrate

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.980
on the message. It would be good if you would watch the record. So we were told to watch

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.580
the record go around and around and around. Of course, we would get a little bit dizzy.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.419
Many times you would knock on the door and set it up. When they call it the door stop setup,

00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:50.899
the party didn't even know it was going on. You started playing the record. The only

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:56.259
thing is with a phonograph, you always had to make sure you had the right record on. Sometimes

00:10:56.259 --> 00:11:01.940
you would use that phonograph at home and you'd play some hillbilly records on. I took

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:11.340
mom's phonograph and I put on my fat swallower playing a Boogie Wiggy and a St. Louis

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:17.299
Blues member. And so if you got out in service and you happen to have a record that was still

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:21.620
on there. So she goes out in the service with a phonograph. Let's up the lead. I have

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:28.580
an important message. And here's fat swallower playing Boogie Wiggy.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:36.019
Some witnesses even nicknamed the phonograph Aaron because it did the talking for us. But

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:43.620
that wasn't the only method that was used. We also used a testimony card. This little card

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.019
would have a nice little presentation on with scripture too and you'd show that the house

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:51.860
holder. And usually they'd only read a few lines and then they'd hand it back to you so

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.299
you'd have to finish the conversation. You'd give it to them to read and then it turned

00:11:56.299 --> 00:12:01.019
over. So sometimes we had to start giving it to them on the wrong side so they would turn

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:07.179
it to read it on the right side. So Phania says, hmm, I can just tell him why I'm there. So

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:13.820
which I did. And to me it was a little easier. Some people were a little short on funds and so

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:20.059
we would offer to trade. So many times out in the country they would trade you for maybe a dozen

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:25.580
eggs for three or four booklets or something like that. Or if it was a book you might end up with

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.700
a chicken or two. So when you went out and field service in the country you had to be prepared to

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:37.100
pick up many different things. Usually probably bagged the chicken up so he was in a bag back in the

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:44.139
trunk. Got a little warm for the poor thing but they survived it and bring him home and then after

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:49.019
we got the chicken out and let him recover why we'd have a nice chicken dinner. So back in those

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:57.809
days we waited a lot of chicken. In addition, plackers and information marches had also come on the

00:12:57.809 --> 00:13:07.600
scene. And brother Rutherford of course was a shorthand expert and whenever you talk to him

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.440
he'd always be busy writing. You wouldn't know what he'd be writing about. So he's doing that

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:19.759
this day and so he ripped it off and he gave it to me and said, what do you think of it? And it's

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:26.879
said religions are staring their racket. So I said, my that's pretty strong. As a matter of fact

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:34.480
I said, that's hot. Well, he said, that's what I meant it to be. So now he said, don't you think

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.120
it's a good idea? Now we're going to have a big information march two days from now. Couldn't

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.360
brother Clay in the printing make up some signs, religions are staring their racket and put them on

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:49.919
poles and we'll have them for the parade. And brother Nora was also in London at that time so he

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:55.120
and I led this parade. This parade was six miles long. A thousand brothers showed up for the parade.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.440
It really was a spectacle. Every second sign would be religion is staring their racket.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:09.039
And the Bobby's, the police gave us protection as we went down to Gidelli Circus, Oxford Street

00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:15.519
right in the center of London. We'd put on the sandwich signs you know that had

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:21.600
some kind of a message and stroggons on it and they'd give us a little sign that we carried you

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.879
know on a stick. We had a religion as a snare in the racket. Then you had to put on the other

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:31.840
sign and he said, boy, that's pretty strong. On the other side it's so god and Christ the king.

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:39.759
And we walked very slowly down the street and then back the other way in an area. And we would

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:44.399
approach people with a hand bill and everybody took them and they were looking at the placard.

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:49.759
They would try to not let you think they were looking at you but they were, they were reading

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:56.240
all of the information on the placard. Some people would see something to the effect that you're

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.519
doing a good work and that was always a blessing to me. And I always should remember the sister who

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:07.200
looked up at the sign that she was carrying. She looked back up over her head and it said,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.240
serve god and Christ the king and she looked at the one in front of her and the back of that sign

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.600
said, religion is a snare in a racket. She said, well, I'm sure glad I don't have to carry that sign.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.919
Well, she was carrying that sign. It was on the back of hers but anyway, she didn't know it so she

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:30.559
was happy. They had adult-sized placards and they had little fellow placards. Well, I was only

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:36.960
about four feet tall but whenever I got there, the little ones were gone. So I only got a big one

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.279
that came underneath here and every time I took a step, I kicked it with my feet but it didn't

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:52.539
make any difference. We enjoyed working with placards. Nobody ever trained me in the ministry.

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:59.980
So one day I was at the meeting and the brother passed out the publisher's cards and I said,

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.100
where's mine? He said, well, you don't get one. You're not a publisher and I said, well, what's

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.419
that? And he said, you got to go preaching. I said, how do you do that? He said, well, come on Saturday

00:16:07.419 --> 00:16:12.700
and go over there and get magazines and then they, I went out and they pointed me at a door.

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:18.779
I was scared but I just went anyway. I didn't care. My first experience in field service was

00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:25.740
really cute. I knocked on the door and they said, hello, I've got something for you and you can

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:32.860
have it for a penny or you can have it free if you promise to read it. I placed one in every door.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:41.259
One morning I was taking a group out in the field ministry and a Navy man shows up at the Kingdom Hall.

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:46.620
He's got his uniform on and I didn't know what to do so I took him door to door with me and it

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.620
was really very interesting. I thought it was pretty neat me going to door to door with a guy in

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.700
the military standing next to me and I'm given my presentations and he's got a Bible and we're

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.179
following along with me. Of course later on I learned really it's not the most appropriate thing

00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:03.820
to take someone in military uniform out in the ministry with you but at that time I did it.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:09.180
So my father in December said, well, he's going to go out in service so I got ready and win with him.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:14.460
Now neither one of us has ever been out in service before. The presiding overseer handed my father

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:19.740
a territory and sent it to us out together. My father said, you take that side and I'll take this

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.059
side and that's what it was like and of course I was no more prepared than the man in the moon.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:30.940
We had pioneers come to our house and they studied with us and she decided to get us started

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:36.539
in the ministry. We would begin with street work but I said no I said I don't want to do that

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:44.539
and she said well that's too bad because I can see the book of life now. There's the names

00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:51.420
of your sisters written there, no Lorraine. As I got older there was a pioneer brother

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:57.660
and the congregation that asked if I'd like to go with him to work with him. He carried a rifle

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:03.180
in the back of his car which I thought was kind of unusual. We'd see a rabbit, he'd stop the car

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.660
and shoot the rabbit and put it in the car. As it got toward the end of the day

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.779
we'd ask him did they know of any place where we could stay overnight because we were out in

00:18:14.779 --> 00:18:20.619
the ministry and the people and two different instances I recall they said well you can stay

00:18:20.619 --> 00:18:25.420
with us. Everyone said well we don't have enough food for supper and the brother said well I

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.940
have a couple of rabbits here if you want to scan them so they did that. I don't think that

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.859
this would work. Now the end carrying a rifle in the car certainly is not a device.

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:42.180
It gradually became clear that the individual minister needed further cultivation.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:49.700
So the brother started perhaps the only school from which not one single solitary person

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:58.500
has ever graduated. The Theocratic ministry school. I recall the time I gave my first six minute talk.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.299
I was not confident in myself so I wrote it down but when I got up to give it

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:08.740
audience fear gripped me and I started and it mattered losing my thoughts. Then I resorted

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:13.619
to reading from the manuscript but my hands were trembling so much that the lines were jumping

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:20.339
up and down. George Ganges. Well I remember when the ministry school started you know and I remember

00:19:20.339 --> 00:19:24.180
the brother who gave a first talk and he was so nervous he was kicking the podium all time.

00:19:24.819 --> 00:19:30.420
Boom boom boom boom I didn't know he was doing it. And I was sure as my heart could be heard

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:35.779
for the first four rows because it was beating so hard. Back then the sisters didn't give talks.

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:40.500
The brothers gave the talks. The sisters didn't we just laughed and giggled at the brothers.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:47.619
I know we were all very very excited as sisters when we were invited to be part of the school.

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:52.099
And I remember we were just I was just so excited I jumped up and was clapping the sisters behind

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:57.299
me with crying. I have to give talks now. They didn't like it but I couldn't figure out why they

00:19:57.299 --> 00:20:02.500
were crying but we were in West Virginia in a little tiny congregation and guess who was to give

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:11.059
the first talk. It was me of course. So I was scared to death but we did it. I think everybody was

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:16.420
quite nervous and apprehensive in the very beginning. So it's really quite a marvelous training

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:22.099
program. It's besides just not just a public speaking it's it's training in life.

00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:27.859
This school would prove invaluable in training God's people to use their gift to speech and

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:34.019
proclaiming the kingdom good news. But at the same time another school was also having a powerful

00:20:34.019 --> 00:20:42.339
effect on the ministry. They watched our Bible College of Gillian. That was five and a half

00:20:42.339 --> 00:20:48.180
months of some of the happiest in my life. It was seemed like everybody else was a

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:54.500
mental theocratic giant. So we were intimidated. I guess I should speak for myself mainly. I

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.180
thought they felt intimidated there and I thought that everybody else probably knew a lot more

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:03.380
than I did. Classes were a delight. Our instructors were brother Schroeder, brother Maxwell Friend,

00:21:04.259 --> 00:21:08.660
Jack Redford and Bob Porter. Well I'll tell you a story from brother friend.

00:21:09.299 --> 00:21:16.740
After I gave one of my talks in Gillian he said to me sister Brooks I admire your grandchildren.

00:21:17.779 --> 00:21:21.299
He said you will be able to tell them such wonderful bedtime stories.

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:31.700
He said brothers Hebrews 412 says God's word is alive. He said don't kill it by the way you read it.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:39.380
I think one thing was the little white house and the kingdom in our preaching classes with brother

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:46.500
Redford. I'm telling you that little white house had a doorbell and a door and you would get sent

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.740
out. My class would decide what objection you were going to get. You come back in I'm telling you

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:59.460
to push that doorbell not knowing what was going to happen behind that door and to see how you

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:07.779
handle it it was real real real formation believe me it prepared us really for the for the ministry

00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:13.059
and what was ahead of us. It was wonderful training for the ministry. I loved it.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.500
The next several decades would see more new schools and training programs

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.460
but it would also witness monumental conventions and groundbreaking new releases.

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:34.700
More tools to help God's people stay focused on the harvest.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:44.980
1950 I don't think there's ever been a convention that had that kind of almost electricity in the air.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:51.859
Everybody is excited they're looking forward to the public talk and the releases everybody wants

00:22:51.859 --> 00:22:59.140
to get the new publications. It was eight days that convention not sure that people could

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:05.140
endure that much these days. Well I was so happy that we're having the convention because the

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:11.700
people used to think we were just some little dinky religion you know and I knew when the

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:17.619
Yankee Stadium was going to straighten them out. But when that New World translation in the

00:23:17.619 --> 00:23:24.099
Greek scriptures was released it was it really brought the house down. Everybody's expressed

00:23:24.099 --> 00:23:32.339
themselves and they clapped and they was cheering and clapping and everybody needed to sit

00:23:32.339 --> 00:23:38.099
until after the session before they got their new books. To have the New World translation even

00:23:38.099 --> 00:23:45.539
though it was the green Bible was just such a wonderful tool for us in the ministry. It was

00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:49.619
exciting then just like it is now every time you get something new and of course you appreciate

00:23:49.619 --> 00:23:54.099
it more as you use it. Another thing I loved about those conventions they had a live orchestra

00:23:54.819 --> 00:24:00.660
and singing with a live orchestra was already exciting but boy when you would sit in those stadiums

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:06.099
and see all your brothers and sisters it just was so heartwarming and made me feel safe inside

00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:10.900
Jehovah's organization. And it was just wonderful every time you went to the convention it was

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:18.180
something thrilling and when it ended we didn't want it to end. This period of expanded activity would

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:24.980
result in publishers, pioneers, Bible studies, return visits, placements and all aspects of the

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:30.980
ministry reaching record eyes. The work was growing in more countries than ever but most importantly

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:37.779
the good news of the kingdom was being preached. But as has often been the case there was much more to come.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.140
Just think of some of the events that you have witnessed in recent decades.

00:24:44.099 --> 00:24:50.980
The Pioneer Service School, the ministerial training school, the school for kingdom evangelizers,

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:59.619
special metropolitan public witnessing, a newly designed JW.org, Caleb and they

00:24:59.619 --> 00:25:08.980
become Jehovah's friend series. The revised New World Translation and now a new language app to

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.859
further train publishers to learn to speak the pure language in multiple languages.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:22.740
Video on Demand, an entirely new website where people can watch morning worship and other

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:31.779
video publications. And finally a return to Broadcasting, our own TV station, JW Broadcasting,

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:38.339
taking the Bible's message from world headquarters to the farthest reaches of the planet.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:45.940
Imagine what we will look back on at the 1,000th or 1,000,000th anniversary of kingdom rule.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:52.180
The past 100 years helps us to appreciate that God's kingdom is real and that Jehovah God has

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:58.900
been using that kingdom to accomplish His will on earth today. But how real is that kingdom to you?

00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:04.819
Looking back on our heritage and speaking to those with years of experience will make the kingdom

00:26:04.819 --> 00:26:11.460
more real to you and will prepare you to benefit from that kingdom. The governing body

00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:18.420
has been anxious to give whatever they can for the building of the brothers and teaching them to

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:23.779
walk the upright world. Oh, I think the revised New World Translation is a marvel.

00:26:23.779 --> 00:26:30.339
The word love isn't big enough to say how much I love that Bible. JW Orang is fantastic.

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:35.539
I'm in my iPad all the time. And then using videos, I'm in love with Caleb.

00:26:35.539 --> 00:26:42.420
He's keeping abreast with what we need to be efficient ministers and to fulfill our responsibilities.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:47.940
Everything at the society has done. It's been very good. We're growing faster today

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:55.299
than we ever have. Jehovah really moving the chariot and we're trying to keep up with it.

00:26:55.299 --> 00:27:00.180
And I've been very grateful for having Jesus' brothers to take the lead for us.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:07.059
There is no question about the kingdom being in control. What else can be more real than the kingdom

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:16.420
and the hope at all? I just feel privileged to have some share in inviting others to join us as

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:22.900
servants of Jehovah God. If the sun comes up, we know that the kingdom is going to accomplish,

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:30.019
just what the Bible says it is. This is the reality. God's kingdom. Everything else is an illusion.

00:27:30.019 --> 00:27:35.299
The kingdom is in control. We only have good things to look forward to.
