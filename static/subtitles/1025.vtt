00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.290
The truth came to our home through my mother.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.289
I was never seriously interested in the truth.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.289
Where we grew up, education was very important.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.289
A person needed to make money and live a lavish life.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.289
So that's the life I chose, to study, to get higher education

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.289
so that I could have what others had.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.289
Although they could see that I wasn't interested in the truth,

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.289
my mother and brother did not give up on me.

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.289
When I came back from school in January,

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:41.289
my mother ordered the examining the scripture's daily booklet for me.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:48.289
Year after year, I always had the examining the scripture's daily booklet and the Bible.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.289
She made sure that although I wasn't attending meetings,

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.600
at least I had literature.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.600
Besides that, my younger brother, the one I was close to,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.600
decided to take the truth seriously.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.599
When I came back from school, I saw my brother getting a Bible study of his own

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:11.599
and I was surprised to see him studying the Bible

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:14.599
and noticed that he had prepared.

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:18.599
He cared about and loved what he was learning.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:23.599
That's when I understood that the Bible changes lives.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:30.599
A scripture that comes to mind is the Hosea 11 verse 4.

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:36.599
There it shows that Jehovah pulls us with cords of love and kindness.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.599
In my situation, Jehovah did this.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:45.599
So I made the decision to be regular at the congregation meetings.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.599
And I finally started studying the Bible with someone in 2007

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.599
and got baptized in 2008.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.599
My family really encouraged me. They never gave up on me.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:03.099
And I encouraged parents not to give up on their children.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.099
They must continue encouraging them

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.099
and have the hope that Jehovah God will draw them to the organization

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.099
because they have good hearts.
