00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:10.039
Sometimes we wonder, what is my value, how valuable am I really?

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:19.039
And in our weak moments we may even wonder, does anyone ever know what I do for Jehovah?

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:27.670
Our text for today gives us real confidence that Jehovah knows everything we do.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.670
He knows every emotional, deep emotion we feel towards Him.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:48.670
It's Mark 14 verse 8, it reads, and this is what Jesus said of Mary, she did what she could.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.670
Let us examine this account more closely and see how important love of God

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.670
and our attitude towards spiritual things play into our value.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.670
Jesus was the guest of honor at the meal, at the house of Simon Delipper.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.670
This was only five days before Jesus celebrated His last Passover.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:23.670
Among the guests were His disciples, but then they were Mary and Martha and also Lazarus

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.670
who had been resurrected just a few weeks earlier.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.670
Mary came and broke open a precious alabaster jar.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.670
It contained very expensive perfume oil.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.670
And then she poured it on the head of Jesus and on His feet and dried His feet with her hair.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.670
The aroma just filled the whole house.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.670
But then something happened that could have spoiled this wonderful occasion

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.670
and turned into an ugly argument.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.669
It's turn year to Mark 14 verses 4 and 5.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:15.669
At this time said to one another indignantly, why has this perfume oil been wasted

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:23.669
for this perfume oil could have been sold for more than 300 denariah and the money given to the poor?

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.669
And they were greatly annoyed with her.

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:32.669
The footnote says they spoke angrily to her, they scolded her.

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:37.669
It was as if what she did was out of place and a waste.

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:43.669
Now Jesus responded immediately and He gave this command in verse 6.

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.669
But Jesus said, let her alone.

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.669
Why do you try to make trouble for her?

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.669
She did a fine deed toward me.

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:02.669
So Jesus wouldn't allow the critics to spoil the occasion.

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:12.669
And He says then the words of our text in verse 8, the A part of verse 8, He said she did what she could.

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:17.669
She gave from the purity of her heart her best.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:22.669
And Jesus knew she did what she could.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.669
And He dignified Mary.

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:31.669
He thanked her for her beautiful gift and He praised her.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:37.669
And you can be sure that Mary didn't go home that evening feeling useless and degraded.

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:47.009
But then He took this event, what Mary did here, to even a higher level.

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.009
We look at verse 8, the B part of verse 8.

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:58.009
He said, she poured perfumed oil on my body beforehand in view of the burial.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:05.009
Mary had no idea how significant this deed was to Jesus.

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:13.009
Jesus viewed this as preparation for His death and burial, upcoming,

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.009
just something that weighing very heavily on His mind.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.009
And what she did was wonderful to Him.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:30.009
Then He says in verse 9, truly I say to you, wherever the good news has preached in all the world,

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.009
what this woman did will also be told in memory of her.

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.009
Now Mary didn't do this to make a name for herself.

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.009
Jesus put it on the record.

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.009
And us even talking about this is fulfillment of that prophecy.

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:58.449
And you can imagine Mary probably is in heaven with Jesus, preparing to bring untold blessings to mankind.

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.449
Jesus also addressed the disciples.

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:11.449
And He helped them to understand that the affairs of this life, as important as they may be,

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:18.449
should never override the priority of the kingdom and the interests of the kingdom.

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.449
He says in verse 7, He makes three little statements that are very powerful.

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.449
The first one for you always have the poor with you.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.449
Always in this case does not mean forever.

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.449
It is only while the system is in existence that they would be poor people.

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.449
In the new world they will not be poor people.

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:46.449
And anyway, the money they could have obtained for that precious material

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:56.449
would not go very far in helping poverty in the land of Israel or even in the province of Judea.

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.449
But Jesus was helping them to understand priorities.

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.449
Because He said in the next phrase, you can do them good whenever you want to.

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:14.449
The next day, the next week, the next month, the next year, poverty would still be there and they could do good.

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.449
But He wouldn't be there as He says here, but you will not always have me.

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.449
The priority at that point in time was not the poor.

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.449
It was Jesus.

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.449
That was the priority.

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.449
And He wanted them to understand the seriousness of the times in which they lived.

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:41.449
We should also just maybe touch a little bit on the viewpoint of Judas.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.449
If you turn to John chapter 12,

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:56.449
it shows that Judas was the one that stirred up this issue in verse 4 and verse 5.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.449
And then it says in verse 6, he that is Judas said this,

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.449
though not because he was concerned about the poor,

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:13.449
but because he was a thief and had the money box and used to steal the money in it,

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:16.449
Judas wasn't concerned about the poor people.

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:21.449
And what Mary did did not fit into his agenda.

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:27.449
And then when Jesus publicly counseled them, Judas was so angry.

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:34.449
He left that place and He went to the chief priests

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.449
and He arranged to betray Jesus.

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:41.449
And He wanted to know how much will they pay Him.

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:44.449
And they said 30 silver pieces.

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:49.449
Another value of the 30 silver pieces, about a hundred denariah.

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:54.980
So you can see the values that Judas had.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:02.980
He put a higher value on the ointment than he put on the life of his master.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.980
Now how on earth could Judas do this?

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.980
He saw the miracles.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.980
He saw the resurrection of Judas, of the Lazarus.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:20.980
How could he do this horrible thing?

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.980
If we look on John 12, 13 verse 2, it says,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:33.980
the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas' scariot to betray Him.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:40.980
So the anger of Judas, the greed of Judas, prepared his insight, opened his insight

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.980
for Satan to get in there and put his wicked thoughts in his mind.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.980
That is sobering, isn't it?

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.980
So in summary, what do we learn?

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.980
We learn that Jehovah knows everything we do.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.980
He knows the love of our heart.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.980
He knows our deepest motives.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.980
And Paul says in Hebrews 6 verse 10,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.980
God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.980
and the love you showed for His name.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.980
By ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.980
The service we render to one another will never be forgotten.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.980
And we never know the consequences.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:31.980
Paul also says in another place that by hospitality some unknowingly entertained angels.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.980
And when Jehovah rewards us with ever-lasting life,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.980
that will be the ultimate statement of our value.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:47.980
We are so important to Jehovah that He wants us to be around forever.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.980
What powerful lessons will learn from these few words?

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.980
Stop making trouble for her.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.980
She did what she could.
