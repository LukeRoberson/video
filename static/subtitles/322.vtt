00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.710
How did it all get there?

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.190
These are the opening words of a booklet

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.789
that was published back in 1950

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.550
and entitled Evolution versus the New World.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.309
That booklet was just what our brothers needed at the time.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.989
For example, in 1954, a man in Algeria

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.390
received a copy of the booklet from a friend.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.070
He said, I devoured it.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.589
And that booklet helped him to come to an appreciation

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.149
of Jehovah as his creator, and he became our brother.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.270
Well, Evolution versus Creation is still an issue today.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.710
And as touched on in some of our comments,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.270
Jehovah's organization has provided additional tools

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.590
that help us both to strengthen our own faith

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.710
in Jehovah's our creator.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.950
And also to help us aid others to come to know Jehovah

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.030
as their all-wise and loving creator.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
These tools help us to follow the instructions

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.359
that are found in 1 Peter 3, verse 15.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.159
Please open your Bibles to this scripture,

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.000
and as we read it, we'll notice two things.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.120
First of all, the scripture encourages us

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.719
to make a defense for our faith, and then it

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.239
tells us the spirit in which we should make that defense.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:29.079
1 Peter 3, verse 15 says,

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.680
But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.159
Always ready to make a defense before everyone

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.400
who demands of you a reason for the hope you have,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.159
but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.680
So there are two key points here.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.040
First of all, we are expected to make a defense for our faith,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.920
and that includes our faith in Jehovah as our creator.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.319
Second, it tells us as we make that defense,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.120
we should do it with a mild temper and deep respect.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.599
Now, over the years, our message about evolution

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.599
and creation has not changed.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.960
However, we have refined the methods

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.560
that we use to present that message.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.680
The approach of the booklet evolution

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.000
versus the New World was very straightforward and direct.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.080
And if you read it, you may say some parts of it

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.919
are even confrontational.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.120
You can see that from the very title of the booklet,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.879
evolution versus the New World.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.120
Then on page three of that booklet, it says,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.680
evolution and the Bible collide head on,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.879
which survives the crash.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:49.520
And it continues, evolution versus the New World,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.159
which wins the war.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:56.599
However, our discussions about evolution and creation

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.120
do not have to end in a collision

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.840
or going to war with the householder.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.680
Really, what we need to do is establish

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.120
what are the facts and what do the facts reveal?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.599
We may be surprised to find that there is even some common ground

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.479
that we have with those who believe in evolution.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.840
For example, a witness student may read in his science textbook

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.879
claims that the earth and the solar system

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.319
are billions of years old.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.039
Now, does this conflict with what the Bible teaches?

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.960
Not necessarily.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.639
The Bible reveals that the earth and the solar system,

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.520
the universe, were in existence

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.960
before the beginning of the first creative day.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.280
So these things could well be billions of years old.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.120
What we need to do is determine the facts

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.240
and then base our conclusions on those facts.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.080
And this is the approach that's taken

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.080
by two powerful brochures that we received back in 2010.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.080
The one brochure is, was life created,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.360
and the second, the origin of life,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.840
five questions worth asking.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.360
The approach of both these brochures

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.920
is positive and it's practical,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.879
and they help us to answer the question,

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.160
how did it all get here?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.920
For example, if we look at page two

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.120
of the was life created brochure,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.480
under a heading entitled,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.920
what is the purpose of this brochure?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.040
It states the following.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.680
It is not the purpose of this material

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.759
to ridicule the views either a fundamentalist

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.399
or of those who choose not to believe in God.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:47.519
Rather, it is our hope that this brochure

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:51.639
will prompt you to examine again the basis

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.199
for some of your beliefs.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.439
Then the brochure, the origin of life on page three,

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:58.720
says this.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.439
Sooner or later, all of us need to confront the question,

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:08.480
was life created or did it evolve?

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:11.240
This brochure will present just some of the evidence

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.879
that has led many to believe that life was created.

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.319
There's nothing confrontational about this,

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.920
we're simply being encouraged to examine the facts.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.439
And after we've separated the fact from the fiction,

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.120
then we want to determine exactly what are

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.279
the needs of the householder.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.800
It may not be necessary for us to go into

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.959
a detailed discussion about DNA or RNA

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:42.639
or pro-cariotic cells.

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.600
Now if we have to explain those things,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.120
we're grateful that we have these two brochures to help us.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.480
However in many cases, a simple illustration

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.720
may be all that is needed to convince our listeners

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.199
of the existence of a creator.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.079
For example, a missionary in Cambodia

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:04.279
took his camera to a motorbike shop

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.800
and he asked the owner of the shop

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.000
to spread out the metal and plastic parts

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.800
of a small motorbike on the floor of the shop

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.399
and the missionary took a picture of those parts.

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:17.399
Then he would show that photograph to a householder

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.879
and ask them,

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.800
now do you think all these parts can just come together

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.680
and become a motorbike?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.040
And the answer is of course not.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.639
But then he shows them a second picture

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.959
with the shop owner standing amongst the parts

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.839
and then he asks them,

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.439
now do you think these parts can become a motorbike?

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.360
And the householder smiles and nods

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.040
and he gets the point.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.600
So usually we're not talking to staunch evolution

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.519
as people who make it their life gold

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:52.680
or promote evolution and discredit the Bible.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.519
For the most part, the people we talk to

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:57.360
have had the theory of evolution thrust at them

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.399
all their lives and they just need to know

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:02.439
and learn the truth.

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:05.279
So the foundation of our belief in Jehovah

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:09.839
as our creator is solid, it's based on fact.

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.120
And that same faith convinces us

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.120
that the promises of a righteous new world will come true.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.399
Evolution offers no such future.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.720
So with full confidence,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.199
may we continue to uphold the sovereignty of Jehovah

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.959
and his creation and may we defend our faith

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:32.839
by sticking to the facts

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.160
and then presenting those facts

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.199
in the way that is understandable to our listeners.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.360
If we do this, they too will recognize the truth

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.199
of Genesis chapter one, verse one.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.399
In the beginning, God created.
