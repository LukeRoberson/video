00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:10.849
And in production to the book of Obadaya, Obadaya was a prophet of Jehovah.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:19.429
He recorded his prophecy about 607 BCE after the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:26.820
Obadaya was a contemporary of Jeremiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.019
The book of Obadaya is the shortest book in the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.270
It has just one chapter.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.979
Obadaya conveys a judgment message against the nation of Edom.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.500
During the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.880
the Edomites rejoice at Israel's suffering.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.840
Edomites capture fleeing Israelites.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.240
They hand them over to the Babylonians,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.060
and Sharon taking spoil from the conquered Jews.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.579
Did you know?

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.819
The Edomites were related to the Israelites.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:10.379
They were descendants of Jacob's twin brother Esau.

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:13.620
He was given the name Edom, meaning red,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.950
after he sold his birthright for some red lentil stew.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.829
Obadaya prophesies that the nation of Edom

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.510
will be plundered at the hands of her former allies.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.709
This prophecy begins to be fulfilled when the Babylonians conquer Edom.

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.519
In time, Edom ceases to exist.

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:40.040
In the closing verses, Jehovah promises to restore his people

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.159
as a unified nation and reestablish true worship in Jerusalem.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.400
The book concludes with the statement,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400
the kingship will become Jehovah's,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.489
indicating that Jehovah's kingship will stand vindicated forever.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.569
As you read Obadaya, note how Jehovah is aware

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.930
of the persecution his people suffer.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.610
How Jehovah gives his people hope and times of distress,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.610
and how Jehovah's lasting kingship will stand vindicated forever.
