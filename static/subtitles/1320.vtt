00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.860
As our organization grows,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.740
so does the need for translation of our literature.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.619
Many remote translation offices have been set up

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.939
in countries around the world

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.780
to keep improving the quality of our translation work.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.019
Recently, one such office was dedicated

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.859
in the African country of Namibia.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.140
And as experiences show time and time again,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.060
many benefits spiritually from the steady expansion

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.500
of our translation efforts.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.020
Our brothers and sisters in Namibia are no exception.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.740
I am happy because I'm able to read the truth

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.060
in Ashkwanyama as I cannot read other languages.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.500
Things have become easy to understand,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.140
because it has been explained well

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.460
and is easily understandable, it reaches the heart.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.140
As the publications become available in a language,

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:09.109
it touched my heart so that I even feel physically strong.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.469
The governing body has realized that

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.989
if we're going to get the very highest quality translation,

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:16.909
the translators should be in the area

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.750
where their language is spoken every day.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.230
And many times when the translators were located

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.670
at branch offices far away from where their languages were spoken,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.390
then many other language words were creeping in.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.629
And also, the people began to lose touch

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.469
with just the everyday way of expressing things.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.390
A remote translation office is an office

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.629
where translation and recording of our publications

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:43.709
take place.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.310
We look at where the language is predominantly spoken

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.349
and also do we have enough congregations.

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:52.750
Are we going to have enough publishers

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.909
to support the translation office?

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.189
You overblast the decision,

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.230
because our brothers and sisters

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.430
from the local congregation can support

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.030
the translation office can commute.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.189
And also, the translators can work along with the congregation.

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.229
I work with one of the translation teams.

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.750
Field Service has a big influence on my work.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.949
It helps me increase my vocabulary.

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.830
I hear how people express themselves

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.509
and that helps me a lot in my assignment.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.990
Because the RTO is in the location

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.550
where the language is originally spoken,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.990
you get to hear expressions that I'm not used to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.110
and I can also use them during my assignment.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.830
My vocabulary also increases

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.789
because I'm around people who speak the Kwaniaman language.

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.629
So there is a lot of benefits being in the location.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.750
Remote translation offices really, like many things,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.669
I think have come up and kind of fooled

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:51.990
the governing body in a sense

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.469
because we didn't really initially see

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.310
the tremendous value that they would have.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.469
Because as we've expanded into more

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.430
and more and more languages,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.110
if we would have had to try to have all of these languages

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.069
at branch offices,

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.310
our branch offices would have to be so large

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.189
that the expense would be really overwhelming

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.349
for the organization.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.090
It's a wonderful privilege to be with you,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.409
brothers and sisters here in Namibia

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:32.039
for this very exciting location.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.639
This is the very first time

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.159
that so many congregations have been tied together

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.360
via internet for a meeting.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.120
Do you know that the number of Bible studies

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.560
has increased by one million in just two years?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.199
Why is it that the number of Bible studies

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.599
is increasing so much in the world?

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.719
We have to attribute this at least in part

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.280
to the tremendous translation work

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.360
that's being accomplished around the world.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.280
At present, we have three project teams.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.039
So a project team is made of three translators

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.479
working together.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.000
And in December of 2014,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.560
they move to these beautiful facilities

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.680
that will be dedicated today.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.000
The translation office is brought closer to you

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.720
so that we can have a share also in making sure

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.079
the publications are available.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:26.519
To accomplish this translation work,

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:30.720
we need remote translation offices all over the world.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.879
Is it your desire, brothers and sisters,

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.519
that we should dedicate this remote translation office

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:39.439
to the worship and praise of our God, Jehovah?
