00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.539
My whole life I wanted to be a teacher.

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.539
It was very gratifying.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:17.539
But yet there was something that was empty in my life.

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.539
I would see children that were disabled.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.539
Not because they had done anything wrong.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.539
They were just born that way.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.539
And I thought to myself,

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.539
that doesn't make sense to me.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.539
God is a God of love.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.539
I know God could fix all these things.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.539
Why hasn't he?

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.539
And then it was a child in my school

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.539
that successfully got me the answers to my questions.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.539
She asked me the question,

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.539
do you know I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.539
Would you like to know more about Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.539
And I thought to myself,

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.540
I do. I really do.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.540
Why don't you come over and visit me someday

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.540
and tell me about Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.540
When she came back the next week, I sat there and listened.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.540
And she taught me things.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.540
She taught me how to look into my own Bible

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.540
to find the answers to questions.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.540
And all of this sudden,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.540
I'm getting answer after answer after answer,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.540
which for 25 years,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.540
I couldn't find these answers anywhere.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
And it was amazing to me.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.540
And I said, yes, this is the way it should be.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540
How do you get a close relationship with God?

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
First thing, you'll learn His name.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.540
And after you know His name,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.540
that's when the relationship gets closer.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.540
And then you get to know Him more and more

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.540
as you go through the Bible,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.540
as you learn scriptures.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.539
And now that emptiness

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.539
that I had felt prior

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.539
was beginning to fill up.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.539
And as you come to know Jehovah,

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.539
then you not only have your emptiness filled,

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.539
you're beginning to bubble over.

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.539
And now you want to share it with others.
