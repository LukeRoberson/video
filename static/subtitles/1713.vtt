00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:10.960
More than 20 years ago, a Wake magazine published the life story of Alina Jitnikova.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.160
Alina realized that pleasing Jehovah would mean rejection by this world.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.839
But in the following episode of Where Are They Now, know what she describes as perhaps

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.399
an even bigger test.

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:34.759
My name is Alina Jitnikova and I was born into a family of a zealous communist.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:41.159
We believed that a world was coming where people would have everything they needed.

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:42.799
They'd be happy.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:50.179
There would be peace worldwide and I deeply believed it.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:01:00.560
But I found paradise among God's people.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:11.079
As I grew up, I realized that communism had its deficits because I saw its hypocrisy.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.920
People didn't practice what they preached.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.480
In high school, I met a friend who started talking about God and the Bible.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:32.280
So the fact that God's name is Jehovah, that something called God's Kingdom and Armageddon

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.560
will come, these were all new concepts for me.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.000
I'd never heard of these things before.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'd never even held a Bible in my hand.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.739
A Bible study gradually helped me gain faith.

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:57.060
In 1983, I was baptized in a bathtub.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.060
At that time, Jehovah's Witnesses were under ban.

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:08.620
In 1989, the Velvet Revolution took place in Czechoslovakia.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.340
That also meant a change for Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.539
Because we could begin to express our faith publicly.

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:26.500
The house to house ministry started and it was something amazing and new for me.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:33.819
I got to know Petter in our local congregation and we got married in 1990.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.060
We entered into a full-time service two years after the wedding.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:47.300
We first started serving as regular pioneers and two years later, we were invited to Bethel.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:57.520
Those were years full of joy, full of hard work which greatly enriched me.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:09.449
We left Bethel eight years later and I found that people had changed and it was a challenge for us.

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:15.509
Because now people have become more materialistic.

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:22.270
When I learned the truth, it seemed to me that Armageddon was at the door, that it would come soon.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.909
And the world helped us in a way because it didn't want us, it didn't want Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:36.710
But today's world, with its freedom, doesn't tell us that it doesn't want us.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.830
In fact, it wants us.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.069
It wants our time.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.590
It wants our attention.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.000
And therefore, there may be a great danger.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.599
We could feel that Armageddon is delaying.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.319
So we might feel the need to fulfill our dreams already today.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.400
Jehovah teaches me to be patient.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.520
Jehovah is a happy God.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.639
And even when he waits, he does not wait idly.

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.360
Jehovah is hard working, he's always doing something.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.000
When you feel the waiting with activity, time goes faster.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.439
The field ministry is very important to me.

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.480
Sometimes it costs a little effort.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.959
But my service partners are always a great encouragement to me.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:38.279
With Jehovah's help, we have nice conversations in service.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:45.990
And even today, we find people who think about the meaning of life.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.470
Service does not only consist of house to house service.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.149
Service is the whole Christian way of life,

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:57.990
including caring for brothers and sisters.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.589
I think serving my brothers and sisters

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:06.810
requires us to set aside time for them.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.529
In this way, I can promote a good atmosphere in the congregation.

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:18.899
To be in the spiritual paradise, I must contribute something.

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:27.459
As a result, the spiritual paradise will be bigger, deeper, and more beautiful.

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:30.459
When we do something for others,

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:35.779
we don't think too much about ourselves, our pain.

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:46.560
And I think life in Jehovah's service is sometimes challenging.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.990
But the result is happiness.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:14.019
And already today, I can say that my dream of a happy life has come true.

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:18.980
We're encouraged to see Sister Alana Jitnikovah and her husband Petr

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.139
remain busy in kingdom service.

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.339
How wonderful that this has helped them to have realistic expectations

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:31.459
and continue to remain joyful.

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:34.540
In a world that wants our time and energy,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.899
all in a maintain her focus by sharing her Christian hope,

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.180
caring for her brothers and sisters,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.579
and doing her all to encourage others.
