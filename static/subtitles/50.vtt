00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.560
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.560
In this month's program, we will feature the study methods that are used in Gilead school.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:16.019
For a moment, let's imagine ourselves starting hard day as a Gilead student.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.019
See you later.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:37.890
Morning, have a good day, class.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.030
Thank you.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.460
Good morning.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:00.460
Good morning, sir.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.460
How are you?

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.460
Good to see you.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.460
How was your night?

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.459
It was good.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.459
A long night of studying, but it was worth it.

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:09.459
I'm really looking forward to the lesson this morning.

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:10.459
You know, I agree with you.

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:11.459
I feel the same.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.459
The information we have been studying is really touching my heart.

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:15.459
I know what you mean.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:18.459
I feel like I've become more of a spiritual person.

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.459
And my relationship with Jehovah has become so much stronger.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:25.920
Good morning, everyone.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.920
What are the study methods that are helping the students grow in their relationship with Jehovah?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.920
And more importantly, how can we apply these methods in our own personal study?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.920
We'll find the answers and more.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.920
Here are some of the highlights of what's ahead.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.920
These brothers and sisters describe how they approach their personal Bible study.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.920
They're from different parts of the world, but they share many common study techniques.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.920
What questions do they ask as they read and meditate on the Bible?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.920
How does their deep study take them beyond the basics of Bible understanding?

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.920
Young ones, are you digging deep into God's word now?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.919
How can this help you make the truth your own?

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.919
And can you succeed even without the support of those spiritually close to you?

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:21.919
This sister's experience will show us the benefits of searching the Bible as if for hidden treasures.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.919
Can you be ready to make a wise choice that matters of conscience?

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:31.919
Do study habits affect how well prepared and trained your conscience is for an unexpected situation?

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.919
We'll see how the sister in this dramatization answers those questions.

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.919
This is JW Broadcasting for July 2018.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:03:03.770
We begin with an archived interview of Brother Alan Boyle.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.770
Among his many assignments, Brother Boyle spent 37 years in the art department at World Headquarters.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.770
The beautiful and accurate illustrations produce their enhanced hour study,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.770
helping us to visualize and meditate on what we are reading.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.770
In assignment to create these pictures is exciting,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.770
but it requires that a person have spiritual qualities.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.770
Artists collaborate and must humbly listen to each other's comments.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.770
They must apply direction from the faithful and discreet slave to prepare artwork that we can take in as spiritual food.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.770
As you'll hear Brother Boyle describe, a person must be an avid student of the Bible.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.770
Listen to Brother Boyle's story and note what he said was needed for him to do his assignment well.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:04:19.930
I was born in 1933. I got to the age of 18 and one supper time my mother had invited the company servants as they were called back then to come for supper.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.930
He asked me what I was going to do with my life.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.930
I said to him, well, I'm going to pioneer for three weeks later at the convention in London.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.930
I got baptized and then went pioneering six months after that.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.930
I was 21 when I was on the circuit work and that was a wonderful experience.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.930
And in those days, of course, you didn't have a car. I used to have a motorbike.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.930
And I'd go around the motorbike and my briefcase and my typewriter and the clothes in the other case on the back.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.930
That was very exciting.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.930
I was invited to go to Gilead and that was wonderfully exciting. We had 103 in the class.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:10.139
Little did I know at that time that I would be sent as a missionary to Ireland.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.139
My friend had been invited to go down to London Bethel to do the artwork there.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.139
I'd always wanted to be in Bethel.

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.139
I thought, well, why don't I just call him up and congratulate him?

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.139
So that's what I did.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.139
And he told me that he decided not to go in.

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.139
So he said, if you're still interested, why don't you call him up and let them know?

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.139
So that's what I did the next morning. I called up London Bethel.

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:37.139
And within a week, I was in London Bethel, doing the graphics work for the magazine.

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.139
It was a wonderful thrilling experience.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:47.459
I was in London Bethel for a couple of years in 1977 to 1979.

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:51.459
And brother Barry invited me to come over to Brooklyn Bethel.

00:05:51.459 --> 00:06:01.740
You know that you're doing something that's going to be beneficial and helpful to other people.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.740
To people even in different languages, in different cultures.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.740
Little painting that you do is going to help them to get a memory of something significant.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:19.310
One of the most beautiful things about working in the art department and doing paintings

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.310
is that it makes you do research.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.310
You have to investigate, is this the right time of the day? Is it night? Is it day?

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.310
What's the sky looked like? What was it like before the flood?

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.310
When Noah built the ark. How did he paint underneath the ark?

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.310
How did he waterproof it? Because that's the most important part, isn't it?

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.310
He used bitumen. Okay, how did he get underneath the ark? Maybe put it on stills.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.310
You have to come up with all these little questions in your mind.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:07:16.389
To do the research was very rewarding.

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:18.389
This is a little model of a boat.

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.389
And underneath the deck, they used to keep a ballast sack of 110 pounds of sand.

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:27.389
And it says in the scriptures that Jesus was asleep on a pillow.

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:31.389
Apparently this was the ballast sack that he was asleep on.

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:37.389
And actually in the Kingdom into linear translation, it doesn't say he was asleep on a pillow.

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:39.389
It says he was asleep on the pillow.

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:49.519
So apparently back 2000 years ago in that area, everybody knew what the pillow was.

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:54.519
I remember meeting a brother once who'd been to Siberia.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:58.519
And he'd taken a snapshot of somebody's kitchen in Siberia.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:03.519
And to my amazement on the wall, pinned with the drawing pins on the wall,

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:08.519
was one of the pages or the publications that we produced here at Brooklyn.

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:14.519
And so remarkably, it's wonderful to feel that whatever we do here,

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:17.519
if it's support work, if it's the painting,

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:20.519
and of course we need a lot of support work for the paintings,

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:25.519
all what we do here has an effect upon the brothers and sisters out there in the world,

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:27.519
wherever it might be.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:30.519
And you really feel that your time is well worth spent.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:36.820
You're adorning the word of truth,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.820
you're helping other people to be taught something from the Bible,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.820
which is going to be to their benefit.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:50.250
It's been very rewarding and thrilling to be in Jehovah's service,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.250
and I've really enjoyed it.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.710
Alan Boyle finishes earthly course in 2016.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.710
Those in the art department, who worked with him,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.710
remember his enthusiasm and his thorough attention to detail.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.710
What Alan brought to his assignment was rooted in his own personal study of the Bible.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:32.710
He founded Rewarding to do the research needed to illustrate Bible scenes.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:38.710
Today, the writing department supplies a team of researchers to assist the artists.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.710
But did you recall what Alan said helped his research?

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.710
He asked questions about the scenes he was painting.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.710
These same kinds of questions are part of the study methods

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.710
Gilead students learning class.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.710
And these are the same methods that we'll learn about in this program.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:04.710
How would you feel if you received an invitation to attend the next class of Gilead school?

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.710
For many, it has been a lifelong dream to attend Gilead.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.710
The course helps students keep a tight grip on the word of life.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.710
For others, the idea of five months of intense study seems intimidating.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:26.710
We know we need to study, but we may find it a challenge to get the most out of the time we spend reading God's Word.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.710
In this program, we will discuss why study is so important.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:38.710
What it means to study something, how you can get more familiar study sessions.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:45.710
Since most cannot attend Gilead, we will demonstrate the method used in Gilead school.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.710
First, why is study so important?

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.710
Only by study can we keep a tight grip on the word of life.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:01.710
When the Apostle Paul penned these words, he was imprisoned in nearing the end of his action-packed life.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:09.710
He had been the Apostle to the nations and had spent his best years taking the Word of God to the unknown world.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:18.710
As he reflected on the fruits of his labors, he wrote a letter to his friends in the congregation in Philippi in Macedonia.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:25.710
Inspired by Holy Spirit, he wrote words that would aid his brothers to gain the prize of eternal life.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.710
These words are found at Philippians chapter 2, verse 15 and 16.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.710
Let's read them.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:43.279
So that you may come to be blameless and innocent children of God without a blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation,

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:47.279
among whom you are shining as illuminators in the world,

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:51.279
keeping a tight grip on the Word of life.

00:11:51.279 --> 00:12:03.279
Imagine the joy Paul felt when he was reunited in the heavenly resurrection with those who listened to his admonition to keep a tight grip on the Word of life.

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:11.279
Whether we have the heavenly or earthly hope, Paul's words can help us gain the prize of eternal life.

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:20.279
They imprint in our hearts and minds a basic exhortation that will lead us through these last days and into our everlasting reward.

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:30.279
The question is, will we remain blameless and without blemish in the midst of this crooked and twisted generation of our day?

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:35.279
Will we rejoice with other faithful servants of God in the new world?

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:45.279
We can and we will if we take to Hart Paul's counsel to keep a tight grip on the Word of life.

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:49.279
Next, what does it mean to study?

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:53.279
Stop and contemplate this word picture for keeping a tight grip.

00:12:53.279 --> 00:13:02.279
Imagine a hiker who was slipped near a ledge, but before falling over the cliff, he grabs hold of a tree branch.

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:05.279
How tight do you think his grip will be on that branch?

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:08.279
This is not a half-hearted effort.

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:17.279
Likewise, keeping a tight grip on the Word of life is not just a mechanical routine nor is it a casual habit.

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:20.279
It requires strenuous effort.

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:25.279
It involves actively living by the truths in God's Word.

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:31.279
To do this, we must understand more than what God expressly commands and condemns.

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:38.279
We must be able to identify principles or life lessons contained in the Bible.

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:47.279
Once identified, we must understand how to match these valuable truths to specific situations in our lives.

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:56.279
Then we must allow these principles to influence our decisions and guide our reaction to trials and temptations.

00:13:56.279 --> 00:14:02.279
Ask yourself, how strong is my grip on the Word of life?

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:09.279
To answer that, let's consider the fundamentals of Bible study.

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:15.279
This is not about old methods or new methods, nor is it about what device you are using.

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:19.279
This discussion transcends devices.

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:22.279
Study requires active thinking.

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:28.279
In a world of increasing distractions, this is becoming an even greater challenge.

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:33.279
We often receive instant information that enables us to quickly recite facts.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:37.279
But this is not the same as active thinking.

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:43.279
Through active thinking, we draw meaningful conclusions in our hearts.

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:47.279
We are certainly grateful for all the study tools we've been given.

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:50.279
We should use these to the full.

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:58.279
At the same time, we need to be careful that these tools do not cause us to develop mental laziness.

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:04.279
Devices can help us to access information, but they can't think for us.

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:08.279
We must work hard if we are to develop new patterns of thinking.

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:13.279
For example, if we study the Watchtower on a device,

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:17.279
we can use the hyperlink feature to read the scriptures.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:21.279
With a simple touch, we quickly find and read the verse.

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:23.279
That is good.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:27.279
If you regularly do this, you get a grip on the Word of Life.

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:32.279
But would you like to get a tight grip on the Word of Life?

00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:39.279
To get a tight grip requires more effort than a swipe of a finger and then swiftly moving on.

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:43.279
You need to slow down and analyze the material.

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:49.279
Only then will the information you study become imprinted on your mind and heart,

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:53.279
leaving a clear and distinct impression.

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:57.279
How then can I get more out of my study?

00:15:57.279 --> 00:16:01.279
Let's demonstrate a method taught during Gilead school.

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:04.279
It involves the use of six questions.

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:13.279
Following poem written by English journalist Rudyard Kipling can help guide better thinking.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.279
I keep six honest serving men.

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:18.279
They taught me all I knew.

00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:25.279
Their names are what and why and when and how and where and who.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:32.279
When studying God's Word, ask yourself these questions and then do research in our publications

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:36.279
to get the facts and discern the spiritual lessons.

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:51.529
To illustrate how to do this, let's open our Bibles to Genesis chapter 49 and look at verses 22 through 25.

00:16:51.529 --> 00:16:55.529
First we ask the when and where.

00:16:55.529 --> 00:17:01.529
Now with some research, we learn that Jacob spoke these words near the end of his life.

00:17:01.529 --> 00:17:09.529
He was in Egypt, but what he described takes us back to Canaan some 40 years when his son Joseph was a young man.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:13.529
Now we have a clear picture of these verses.

00:17:13.529 --> 00:17:17.529
So now let's read and analyze verse 22.

00:17:17.529 --> 00:17:28.529
Joseph is the offshoot of a fruitful tree, a fruitful tree by a spring whose branches extend over the wall.

00:17:28.529 --> 00:17:35.529
The offshoot of a fruitful tree, who is the fruitful tree? It is Joseph's father Jacob.

00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:39.529
How was he fruitful? He bore many children.

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:44.529
Joseph's branches extend over the wall.

00:17:44.529 --> 00:17:51.529
As Jacob's offshoot, Joseph is singled out for a special blessing superior to that of his brothers.

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:56.529
Why? Joseph proved he had the qualities needed for leadership.

00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:03.529
However, of even greater value than his abilities was his being a spiritual man.

00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:06.529
Let's read verse 23.

00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:13.529
But the archers kept harassing him and shot at him and kept harboring animosity against him.

00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:19.529
The archers kept harassing him. Who are the archers? Joseph's half-brothers.

00:18:20.529 --> 00:18:28.529
How? They shot figuratively at Joseph, arrows of envy and hatred and jealousy were used to attack him.

00:18:28.529 --> 00:18:32.529
Now eventually his brothers sold him into slavery.

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:35.529
Now let's read verse 24.

00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:41.529
And yet his bow remained in place and his hands staged strong and agile.

00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:47.529
This was from the hands of the powerful one of Jacob, from the shepherd, the stone of Israel.

00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:51.529
His bow remained in place. How?

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:56.529
Despite the repeated attacks, Joseph repaid animosity with kindness.

00:18:56.529 --> 00:19:02.529
Joseph endured this ill treatment and did not weaken in his devotion to God.

00:19:02.529 --> 00:19:10.529
Now we ask, how? How is it that Joseph kept a spiritual outlook despite the harassment and animosity?

00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:13.529
Let's read verse 25.

00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:21.529
He, Joseph, is from the God of your father and he will help you and he is with the Almighty.

00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:30.529
And he will bless you with the blessings of the heavens above, with the blessings of the deep below, with the blessings of the breasts and womb.

00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:33.529
He is with the Almighty.

00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:36.529
Joseph had Jehovah's help.

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:39.529
The Almighty was by his side through it all.

00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:45.529
We've used our questions to get the facts of the account, but we're not done.

00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:49.529
Now let's use them to take our study to a spiritual plane.

00:19:49.529 --> 00:19:53.529
Next, let's ask a what question?

00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:57.529
What does this account teach us about Jehovah?

00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:01.529
Jehovah never abandons his loyal servants.

00:20:01.529 --> 00:20:05.529
Even in the depths of prison, Joseph was not alone.

00:20:05.529 --> 00:20:09.529
Jehovah found ways to bless Joseph.

00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:14.529
Now make the connection to Jehovah's people today, including yourself.

00:20:14.529 --> 00:20:17.529
Jehovah will never abandon us.

00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:22.529
Rather, he shows loyal love to all those who serve him whole soul.

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:29.529
Would Jehovah let Joseph remain in prison indefinitely? No.

00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:32.529
At the appointed time, relief came.

00:20:32.529 --> 00:20:37.529
Joseph was raised from a prisoner in chains to the second most powerful man in Egypt,

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:40.529
from prison to palace in one day.

00:20:40.529 --> 00:20:43.529
Make the connection to us.

00:20:43.529 --> 00:20:45.529
Our trials are temporary.

00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:51.529
Jehovah will soon bring relief, even in unexpected or surprising ways.

00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:55.529
Meanwhile, we are never alone.

00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:58.529
Jehovah is with us.

00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:02.529
Again, let's ask the question, how?

00:21:02.529 --> 00:21:07.529
How does the account contribute to the Bible's theme?

00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:15.529
Joseph suffered, but his suffering led to the survival of Abraham's offspring, leading to the Messiah.

00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:19.529
Joseph's account is not just a riveting story.

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:24.529
It directly contributed to the development of Jehovah's purpose.

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:26.529
Think about this.

00:21:26.529 --> 00:21:30.529
In spite of the poor conduct of his brothers,

00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:36.529
Joseph forgave them and took the initiative to improve their relationship with him.

00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:44.529
Joseph's attitude was a reflection of Jehovah's attitude, with their family reunited.

00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:52.529
Jehovah also forgave Joseph's brothers and took the initiative and restoring their relationship with himself.

00:21:52.529 --> 00:22:01.529
In fact, Jehovah gave Joseph's brother Judah the honor of being an ancestor of the Messiah.

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:04.529
What are the lessons in this account?

00:22:04.529 --> 00:22:06.529
Let's highlight just one.

00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:10.529
Genesis chapter 49 and verse 23.

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:17.529
But the archers kept harassing him and shot at him and kept harboring animosity against him.

00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:21.529
Arrows of animosity were fired at Joseph.

00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:27.319
Recall Joseph's response in verse 24,

00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:33.319
and yet his bull remained in place and his hands stayed strong and agile.

00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:37.319
In other words, he did not return fire.

00:22:37.319 --> 00:22:44.319
His bull remained in place, reflect on the last time you were wronged by someone.

00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:48.319
How could someone react to what you experienced?

00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:53.319
Would we seek to vindicate ourselves or insist on our rights?

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:57.319
Would we fire arrows of animosity in return?

00:22:57.319 --> 00:23:01.319
Or could we show mercy and loyal love?

00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:06.319
Would our reaction reveal that God's spirit was operative on us?

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:13.319
Like Joseph, we know we will have Jehovah's approval even if we are wronged or experienced trials

00:23:13.319 --> 00:23:16.319
that make us feel like we are in prison.

00:23:16.319 --> 00:23:21.319
Reflective questions like these enable us to make the account our own.

00:23:21.319 --> 00:23:25.319
It becomes part of us, part of our way of thinking, our way of acting.

00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:29.319
This nourishes our relationship with Jehovah.

00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:38.319
This type of study rewards us, not simply with a collection of facts that impress us today and are forgotten tomorrow.

00:23:38.319 --> 00:23:46.319
Rather, it leaves us with core principles that we remember that influence our decisions and that guide our lives.

00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:51.319
We tighten our grip on the word of life.

00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:54.319
Let's review the fundamentals of study.

00:23:54.319 --> 00:24:00.319
Again, this is not about old methods or new methods or about what device you are using.

00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:03.319
This discussion transcends devices.

00:24:03.319 --> 00:24:08.319
It's about basic methods of Bible study.

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:15.319
We can liken these three phases of study to gathering, sifting, and baking grain.

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:18.319
Gathering is when we read the Bible.

00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:23.319
We don't run through the field, grabbing just handfuls of grain.

00:24:23.319 --> 00:24:26.319
We systematically harvest the field.

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:32.319
Sifting is when we sort out what we gather, answering who, what, where, when, why, and how

00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:34.319
to get the facts.

00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:39.319
Baking is when we think, turning up the heat in your mind and heart.

00:24:39.319 --> 00:24:43.319
Something no one else can do for you.

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:48.319
The questions we ask can take our study to a spiritual plane.

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:53.319
Most importantly, what does this teach me about Jehovah?

00:24:53.319 --> 00:24:58.319
How does it contribute to the Bible's theme and the bottom line?

00:24:58.319 --> 00:25:01.319
What is the lesson for me?

00:25:01.319 --> 00:25:06.890
Jehovah gave us a mind that is begging to learn.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.890
It is a gift with the capacity to cultivate thinking ability.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.890
When we make the effort to unearth gems from God's Word,

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.890
we find that study is rewarding and delightful.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:23.890
More importantly, our study skills enable us to keep a tight grip on the Word of Life.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.890
A tight grip on God's Word will make our life better now

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:38.130
and give us the opportunity to continue learning about our Heavenly Father for all eternity.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:45.130
Joseph's account was an excellent example for us to demonstrate the fundamentals of Bible study.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:51.130
During our discussion, we used pictures to help bring the account to life.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:59.130
As we learn from Brother Boyle's interview, pictures and illustrations give us an accurate image to use in our meditation.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:06.130
And if there's a video, we have yet another way to imagine ourselves in the account.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:14.130
So we're excited to introduce this month's music video depicting the trials and blessings that Joseph experienced.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:30:32.299
It reminds us that, like Joseph, when we have Jehovah, we are never alone.

00:30:32.299 --> 00:30:35.299
Have you ever felt as Joseph did?

00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:40.299
There were times when Joseph's life was not turning out as he had hoped.

00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:44.299
He no doubt wondered if he'd ever be set free from prison,

00:30:44.299 --> 00:30:49.299
or if he'd ever see his father again, or his younger brother Benjamin.

00:30:49.299 --> 00:30:54.299
But Joseph knew that his God, Jehovah, never lost sight of him.

00:30:54.299 --> 00:30:57.299
This surely helped him endure.

00:30:57.299 --> 00:31:02.299
We could be in a painful situation that seems to drag on endlessly.

00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:07.299
But when we study a Bible account like Joseph's, asking the sixth questions,

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:11.299
we can fully understand and apply the lessons in our life.

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:19.299
Then we can build the same faith that he had, that we too are never alone.

00:31:19.299 --> 00:31:24.299
Let's now listen to brothers and sisters who are using the study methods we've discussed.

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:32.299
Some learn them in Gilead school, others from Gilead graduates, or good examples in their family and congregation.

00:31:32.299 --> 00:31:37.299
They've also applied what they learned from our publications about good study habits.

00:31:37.299 --> 00:31:43.299
See if any of the ways they study could help you keep a tight grip on God's Word.

00:31:43.299 --> 00:31:52.509
The more you study, the more you understand Jehovah, the more you understand Jehovah, the more you love them.

00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:56.509
Jehovah clearly tells us that my thoughts are not your thoughts.

00:31:56.509 --> 00:32:04.509
So if you want to understand Jehovah's thinking better, we need to dig deep in our study and then share those thoughts with others.

00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:09.509
Personal study is like fuel that keeps you going.

00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:15.509
Personally, I'm not a good student, but I really learned how to study the Bible.

00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:18.509
The Bible came alive during Gilead.

00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:23.509
Self-discipline is involved very much.

00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:34.509
I overcome the tiredness aspect of Bible study by not doing it at a time of day when I know I'm going to be tired.

00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:38.509
I can be tired for other things later on, but not for that.

00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:43.509
Each session of my Bible study begins with a prayer.

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:50.509
Please help me recognize it is counsel for me, and then give me the strength to work on it.

00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:54.509
I have a color code system, so I know what certain things stand for.

00:32:54.509 --> 00:33:07.509
I have a particular color for Jehovah's good hand in people's lives that have another color for warning examples.

00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:12.509
I have another for fine examples to imitate.

00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:15.509
Study and Meticion works together.

00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:22.509
Study helps us to acquire information, and Meticion empowers us to put that information into practice.

00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:29.509
You have to get behind the information, not just focus on one verse or a one chapter.

00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:39.509
See who's involved, the time, the conditions, how many people are there, and then you'll get the true meaning of the verse.

00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:43.509
John 11, who is the word?

00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:50.509
We can go to verse 18. Begotten meant he had a beginning, a time when he started.

00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:57.509
When he began, in heaven with his father, that's where he was.

00:33:57.509 --> 00:34:02.509
Philippians 4, 6 and 7 is a scripture that I've read many times over.

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:07.509
The piece of God that excels all thought, okay? How do you get that?

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.510
It's from having a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:17.510
How is it that God's peace guards your heart by means of Christ Jesus our Lord?

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:21.510
And I said, why by Jesus?

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:24.510
Because Jesus paid the ransom.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:32.510
That ransom is what makes possible a relationship with Jehovah, so it almost goes full circle.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.510
During my personal study, I tried to identify principles.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.510
To do this, I tried to look behind the commandment.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:45.510
For instance, at May 28, 1920, Jesus commanded us to go and make disciples.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:49.510
Beyond this commandment, I find this principle of loving our neighbor.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:57.510
Using this principle helped me to preach to all sorts of people, the goddess of their gender, race, or nationality.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:05.179
I attended a school for congregation elders which had Gilead graduates as instructors.

00:35:05.179 --> 00:35:11.179
One of the methods is to analyze a certain Bible account from different perspectives.

00:35:11.179 --> 00:35:14.179
We can't see the whole picture from one angle.

00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:21.179
I share my research results with Bible students and that helps them to know Jehovah better and it helps them to see

00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:24.179
that what they're studying is a practical value.

00:35:24.179 --> 00:35:32.179
I had studied up on Jacob. He wrestled all night with an angel.

00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:36.179
And I wanted to share it with some of my friends.

00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:42.179
One of the brothers that happened to sit around when this discussion was going on.

00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:45.179
He came back to me and he said to me,

00:35:45.179 --> 00:35:50.179
I had concluded my arrangements to quit for time service.

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:56.179
But after listening to that discussion, I've decided I'm no longer stopping.

00:35:56.179 --> 00:36:01.179
And that was such a wonderful moment for me.

00:36:01.179 --> 00:36:04.179
I thanked Jehovah.

00:36:04.179 --> 00:36:11.179
When I learned that I was going to become a mom, I said, Jehovah, if this little one could love you,

00:36:11.179 --> 00:36:17.179
then I'll get to keep him forever. Then I began to teach everything I was learning to him.

00:36:17.179 --> 00:36:24.179
So it's a matter of keeping my face strong and there's no shortcut.

00:36:24.179 --> 00:36:28.179
Every session of study that is properly done with good meditation

00:36:28.179 --> 00:36:34.179
adds a new pillar to the strength of our faith.

00:36:34.179 --> 00:36:40.179
I look forward to those times when I can run upstairs by myself and just shut everything off and just,

00:36:40.179 --> 00:36:43.179
and it's just me and Jehovah.

00:36:43.179 --> 00:36:50.179
Life today is very unpredictable, but I've come to see that as long as I keep a tight grip on God's Word,

00:36:50.179 --> 00:36:53.179
nothing can separate me from God's love.

00:36:53.179 --> 00:37:00.550
The joy these brothers and sisters get from their personal study is clearly heard in their expressions.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:05.550
Recall what they said, the more you understand Jehovah, the more you love him.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.550
Study is like fuel that keeps you going.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:13.550
And I can shut everything off and it's just me and Jehovah.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:19.550
We also heard them ask the six questions, who, what, where, when, why, and how?

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.550
They also use tools for research and note-taking that works for them.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:29.550
Is there something you saw or that we discussed that you'd like to add to your study routine?

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.550
If so, try it out.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:38.550
Young ones, it's true that the more you understand Jehovah, the more you love him.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:45.550
And what a blessing you have if your family worships Jehovah with you and teaches you how to draw close to him.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:50.550
Some young ones have had to build their faith without their family's support.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:55.550
Listen to the experience of Hercy Royer from the United States.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:59.550
What spiritual decision did she face at just 14 years old?

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:06.550
And what did she do that illustrates the value of deep personal study?

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:12.550
Growing up, it wasn't the typical, my mom's a pioneer, my dad's an elder,

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.550
and we're doing great in the congregation.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.550
My family life wasn't the best.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:23.550
So why would I want to do this religion that nobody's happy and are family with?

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:31.550
And I think that could make you feel very alone or odd or awkward or secluded.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:35.550
And at that time, I was graduating eighth grade.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:39.550
There were dances, friends were hanging out, going to parties.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:44.550
And I remember thinking, wow, these look like really nice kids.

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:47.550
Why wasn't I doing that?

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:54.550
I hadn't really delved into the Bible enough to answer questions that I really needed to know.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.550
I went and prayed at Jehovah and said, I'm so sorry, but today I'm not a witness.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:02.550
I'm going to try to prove everything that I've been taught is wrong.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:07.550
I asked him if he's real to help me understand.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.550
So I go in my room, shut the door.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.550
I got every book off the shelf.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.550
I started off organized.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:19.550
But by the end of the evening, I had books all over the place, pages open.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:24.550
The more I kept reading about Jehovah, the more the next topic it would take me to

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.550
to then connect the scriptures.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.550
Jesus is linked to Jehovah.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.550
The angels are linked to Jehovah.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.550
Resurrection is linked to Jehovah.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:37.550
You can't believe in one and not everything else if you really want to know the truth.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.550
And so that's what did it for me.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:46.550
Especially the scripture in Psalms when it said that you saw even the embryo of me.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:55.550
And it was an emotional scripture for me because I thought, wow, my parents aren't doing great in the truth right now.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:40:00.550
But Jehovah found a way to find me, and he knew what I could be.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.550
Now I have my answer. I don't have an excuse.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.550
Jehovah gave me enough knowledge that now I'm responsible.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.550
I now need to act on that and show my love and return for him.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:17.550
Within a week, I found another sister in the hall that was really helpful in me getting out and service quite often.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:22.550
I don't think to the stage she ever knows how much I appreciated that.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:28.550
Although things were declining in our family spiritually, I was able to get baptized.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:34.550
As I progressed spiritually, I could see that I did not have the support of my family.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:37.550
But I had to trust that Jehovah would help me through it.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:47.550
And at least by the time I got home if there was an issue, I had the strength of the meeting and the brothers and sisters in that joy that they couldn't take away from me.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:52.550
Remember I came home one day with some friends. It was a nice day.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:58.550
Encouraging, upbuilding, we pull in our driveway. They dropped me off, say goodbye.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:04.550
My parents were really upset when they came and met me at the door.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:10.550
They couldn't fully understand why I was making my decisions.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.550
The way I was to serve Jehovah more fully.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:21.550
We just could not agree on where my relationship with Jehovah was going.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:27.469
And at that point, I left with the clothes on my back.

00:41:27.469 --> 00:41:32.469
In the matter of a few minutes, my life forever changed.

00:41:32.469 --> 00:41:50.239
I had a spiritual aunt that took me in and helped me gather myself together and literally fed me, clothed me, helped me spiritually.

00:41:50.239 --> 00:41:56.239
And so then my support became Jehovah and the congregation.

00:41:56.239 --> 00:42:04.239
I remember a sister told me years ago, be who you needed when you were young.

00:42:04.239 --> 00:42:14.239
And so when I look at those little ones, I look at myself and say, how could I have benefited from someone taking the time for me when I was that age?

00:42:14.239 --> 00:42:19.239
I have always tried remembering the young ones because that's just part of who I am.

00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:23.239
And making sure that they know that they're not alone.

00:42:23.239 --> 00:42:32.239
If there was a young one out there that wasn't sure if this is the truth or not, I would like them to know that Jehovah knows who they are.

00:42:32.239 --> 00:42:37.239
And he's finding a way for them to know him and that Jehovah is real.

00:42:37.239 --> 00:42:41.239
And he knows them by name.

00:42:41.239 --> 00:42:45.239
And he wants him to live and he's fighting for them.

00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:54.239
How amazing that young Hershey chose to spend an entire day studying, proving to herself that Jehovah knew her and loved her.

00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:57.239
But this was no one time study marathon.

00:42:57.239 --> 00:43:05.239
From there she worked to develop the study habits she needed to endure, grow and become a spiritual person.

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:10.239
She pioneered for several years and now serves at Bethlehem with her husband, Jeff.

00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:21.239
In my conversation with Hershey, she expressed her love for her family and the hope that someday in the future she'll be reunited with them spiritually.

00:43:21.239 --> 00:43:29.239
There's no situation in life that cannot be handled better than by seeking Jehovah's guidance in the Bible.

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:32.239
That's certainly true in matters of conscience.

00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:43.239
In these situations, Jehovah does not tell us what to do with a command, but his word gives us the principles we use to train our conscience.

00:43:43.239 --> 00:43:48.239
In this dramatization, Emma has to make a difficult decision.

00:43:48.239 --> 00:43:54.239
How is her conscience involved and what steps does she take to make her decision?

00:43:54.239 --> 00:44:01.929
Every day we make choices that can affect our relationship with Jehovah.

00:44:02.929 --> 00:44:08.929
When there's a clear scriptural command, the right choice may seem easy.

00:44:08.929 --> 00:44:11.929
But what if there's not?

00:44:11.929 --> 00:44:17.880
How can we be sure we're making a wise decision?

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:28.300
An invitation to our nieces wedding arrived. Thomas was excited about it.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:38.429
I was excited too, but the ceremony was being held at a local church.

00:44:38.429 --> 00:44:43.429
I wondered if it would still be okay for me to attend.

00:44:43.429 --> 00:44:51.429
Even though Thomas wasn't yet willing to accept a Bible study, he gradually softened over the years since I came into the truth.

00:44:51.429 --> 00:45:03.429
I knew he understood why I would never enter a church for worship, but what about attending a wedding? Jehovah approves the weddings.

00:45:03.429 --> 00:45:12.769
That afternoon, I went to help Amy plan a menu for the Pioneer School lunch coming up.

00:45:12.769 --> 00:45:19.769
She noticed I was a bit distracted, so I told her my concerns about the wedding.

00:45:22.769 --> 00:45:31.690
Amy sure had a strong opinion on the matter, but I didn't feel she really understood my situation.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:38.739
Although I appreciated her concern, I felt like she was judging me.

00:45:38.739 --> 00:45:45.739
The next day, I decided to visit Charlotte and Ellen and ask their advice.

00:45:45.739 --> 00:45:53.739
Like me, Charlotte had come into the truth many years before Ellen, so they really understood my situation.

00:45:53.739 --> 00:46:01.739
Is Amy right? Would it be wrong to attend the wedding? What would you do if you were moved?

00:46:01.739 --> 00:46:09.739
Charlotte explained that in situations with is no specific Bible command, it becomes a matter of conscience.

00:46:09.739 --> 00:46:17.269
And what one person's conscience allows may be different from another.

00:46:17.269 --> 00:46:38.210
The important thing is that we make decisions that leave us with a good conscience. But how do I do that?

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:43.210
Dear Emma, it's really a matter of training.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:48.210
Ellen showed me the scripture in Hebrews 5 verse 14 where the Apostle Paul wrote,

00:46:48.210 --> 00:47:01.309
Solid food belongs to mature people. To those who through use have the powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:13.840
But Paul didn't just write those words. He lived them. He carefully studied the principles in God's Word.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:24.489
And as a result, you were able to make decisions that left him with a good conscience.

00:47:24.489 --> 00:47:32.489
So even when there's no stated law on a matter, we can always find a Bible principle that can give us insight into God's thinking.

00:47:32.489 --> 00:47:40.849
So I made it a matter of prayer and then I got to work.

00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:51.480
I researched articles in the Watchtower Publications Index and Research Guide.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:57.139
I found a really good thought in chapter 2 of the God's love book.

00:47:57.139 --> 00:48:09.110
I also read about others who faced similar situations and what Bible principles they found helpful.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.110
Then I meditated on all these.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:27.500
As I kept studying, I was able to bring my conscience in harmony with Jehovah's spirit, not just with my heart.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:46.409
I realized that having a Bible-trained conscience doesn't mean everyone will always think exactly alike.

00:48:46.409 --> 00:48:52.409
And that's okay. But if we train our conscience by applying Bible principles,

00:48:52.409 --> 00:48:58.409
it will guide us along in life so that each of us can remain in God's love.

00:48:58.409 --> 00:49:03.809
What did our sister Emma do that we can imitate?

00:49:03.809 --> 00:49:07.809
When she realized she needed more information, she got to work.

00:49:07.809 --> 00:49:14.809
She studied in order to train her conscience and make a decision that left her conscience clean.

00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:19.809
We can do the same when a conscience matter comes up, but we can do more.

00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:21.809
We can prepare in advance.

00:49:21.809 --> 00:49:26.809
Train our conscience on matters that do not have clear Bible commands.

00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:32.809
Study Bible principles that teach our conscience the rules it should work with.

00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:34.809
Then when we need it, it's ready.

00:49:34.809 --> 00:49:40.809
We can trust it and make decisions in harmony with a Bible-trained conscience.

00:49:41.809 --> 00:49:47.809
We urge you, brothers and sisters, keep a tight grip on the word of life.

00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:49.809
That's what our program has been about.

00:49:49.809 --> 00:49:57.809
We learned why it's essential to stay close to God and receive His gift of everlasting life.

00:49:57.809 --> 00:50:05.809
But what's more, we learned practical ways to do it using tried and true methods of personal Bible study.

00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:10.809
We may not have opportunity to attend Gilead or another Theocratic school,

00:50:10.809 --> 00:50:15.809
but Jehovah's shows all of us how to benefit from His written word.

00:50:15.809 --> 00:50:18.809
What an expression of God's love.

00:50:18.809 --> 00:50:26.250
To prepare this month's program, our team spent time with the Theocratic schools department

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:30.250
at the World Headquarters facility in Patterson, New York.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:34.250
This has been the home for Gilead schools since 1995.

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:39.250
And since arriving here, 47 classes have graduated.

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:43.250
Gilead school began with its first class in 1943.

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:47.250
And since then, close to 9,000 students have been trained.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:52.250
When students come to class each day, their writings and models on display

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:58.250
put their mind on spiritual things as they get ready to study God's word.

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:03.250
Isaiah 119 says, the earth will certainly be filled

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:07.250
with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:12.250
Our worldwide brotherhood works in harmony with that prophecy.

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:18.250
It's fitting then that here in the classroom lectures cover every part of the Bible

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:23.250
exploring background information to get the sense of the account.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:28.250
Probably still got bruises and also telling them very honestly

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:31.250
we have to enter through many tribulations.

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:35.250
Imagine you're sitting there looking at this man bruised and cut

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:43.250
and he's saying, we, you and I, we have to go through many tribulations.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:50.250
Students participate freely, drawing lessons they can use in their life and assignments.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:54.250
It impresses me to see that the Christian congregation in our time

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.250
follows exactly the pattern that was used to make them.

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:04.250
Studying in the Theocratic school's library is a cherished part of their day.

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:08.250
In a quiet, relaxed setting, they associate figuratively

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:13.250
with the faithful and discreet slave, searching and taking in the spiritual food

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:19.250
that nourishes and strengthens their relationship with their Heavenly Father Jehovah.

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:24.250
Students benefit from the hard work of the school instructors.

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:27.250
Under the direction of the teaching committee of the governing body,

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:32.250
they manage the curriculum for Gilead and other schools that are taught here

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.250
and in the field.

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:37.250
Through their diligent efforts and Jehovah's blessing,

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:42.250
theocratic schools staff counted a privilege to serve their brothers

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.250
and the governing body.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:51.670
We send you our sincere Christian love and greetings.

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:54.670
Thank you for joining us this month.

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:59.670
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
