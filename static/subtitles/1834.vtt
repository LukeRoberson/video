00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.330
Sometimes just getting to talk to people can be a challenge.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.330
To overcome this obstacle, we need to be flexible.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.329
Takanori and Yumi Takahashi have served in territories that are as different as night and day.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.329
Recently, they visited our studio.

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:29.379
Listen as they tell us how they have learned to meet the challenges of bearing thorough witness.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.380
Takanori and Yumi, welcome to our studio.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.380
Thank you for inviting us.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380
And we're very happy to have you here.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.380
Takanori, you and I go back a long way.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.380
I still remember when you came into Japan Bethel back in 1977,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.380
and we served in the same congregation for a number of years.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.380
But then in 1990, you had a big change in your life.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.380
Would you like to tell us what happened?

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.380
Yes.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.380
My twin brother, Nobuwaki, was also serving at Bethel.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.379
To our surprise, we were assigned to Papua New Guinea as missionaries.

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:08.379
That was a big change.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:13.379
And here you are working in the rural territory of Papua New Guinea.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:18.379
During your 25 years in Papua New Guinea, I understand that you served in the missionary field,

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:21.379
in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:24.379
So Yumi, when did you come into the picture?

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:28.379
Takanori and I were married in September 1993,

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.379
and I joined him in the missionary work.

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:36.379
Adapting to remote territories such as this was a challenge.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:42.379
So in order to bear thorough witness, what kind of challenges did you have to overcome?

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:46.379
The people of Papua New Guinea are very friendly.

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.379
They have a deep respect for the Bible.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:54.379
It was easy to relax, speak to them face to face,

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:59.379
to read the scriptures together, and to read with them.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:01.379
Those don't sound like challenges.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.379
Did you face any obstacles?

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:08.379
When we preached in the villages, the response of the local people

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.379
often depended on the response of the village chief.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.379
If he listened, almost the whole village listened.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.379
But if his response was negative,

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.379
the people would walk away and hide in the bush.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:30.379
So we would always show respect and approach the village chief first.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.379
This often moved him to view our visit with favor.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.379
Challenging the cities was mainly security.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:46.379
It wasn't safe for us to go into some areas alone or to visit homes regularly.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:54.379
So we would ask our Bible students to come to the Kingdom Hall for their study before the meeting.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.379
That was a good way to encourage them to attend meetings.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.379
Well, it's obvious that you enjoyed your service in Papua New Guinea.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.379
But now you're serving as special pioneers in the Myhama congregation,

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.379
just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.379
So you went from a territory where people have deep respect for the Bible

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.379
to a land where less than 1% of the people claim to be Christian.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:27.379
So what other kind of differences did you find between your territory in Japan now and your missionary territory?

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.379
Oh, it's very different.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.379
Tokyo Disneyland is in a territory.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:39.379
And 70% of homes are in high security apartment buildings.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:47.379
We have to stand in the lobby, in front of the door, press a button and speak to our camera.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.379
Coming from Papua New Guinea, we found it challenging to work this territory.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.379
We were used to friendly discussions face to face.

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.379
Now we see only the lens of a camera.

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.379
But we have learned to view the camera as our friend.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.379
I think most of us find it challenging to speak to a camera.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.379
So how do you overcome this challenge?

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:20.379
We know that as soon as we push the button, our face shows up on the screen inside of the apartment.

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:27.379
We stand on arm lengths from the camera so that our face is framed nicely.

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:34.379
And we adjust our volume accordingly, taking into consideration the Doha Man and the others who may be listening.

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:41.379
We say our greeting about two seconds after we push the button.

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.379
Just when we know that they are looking at the monitor.

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:52.379
Our friendly greeting and warm smile makes them feel like we can actually see their face.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:05:01.379
We prepare a specific appealing introduction and show them respect and conservation.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:09.379
The people in our territory like to be viewed as successful, not as people who have problems.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.379
So we try to focus on positive subjects.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:20.379
We prepare a variety of subjects so that they don't hear the same message over and over.

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:25.379
Like many people, Japanese do not like to be put on a spot.

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:30.379
So instead of asking a question and waiting for them to answer,

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:37.379
we use the teaching method of our trucks and give three possible answers for them to choose from.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:42.379
Well, have you had positive results from this income preaching?

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:48.379
Since we started to use this method, the number of note homes has decreased.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:58.379
And also, when we meet people on the street, sometimes they say they know us because they saw us on their intercom.

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.379
That was excellent!

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:09.379
And thank you Takanori and Yumi for sharing with us how you have met the challenge of bearing thorough witness in a variety of territories.
