00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:09.269
Qualified trained brothers and sisters are needed everywhere within God's organization today.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.710
We need them to preach the good news. We need them here at World Headquarters.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.989
We need them at branch offices all around the world. We need them on construction projects,

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.510
as well as in our own local congregations.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.789
Well, that means that we all need to think about what we personally can do to train others.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.509
It also means, of course, that we need to be ready to be trained.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:43.070
We need to open our minds and hearts so that we can accept training so that we can become more valuable to Jehovah.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.869
But when it comes to being trainers, our Heavenly Father Jehovah sets the most beautiful example for us,

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.390
really a perfect example in being a trainer.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.469
And this morning, I thought it would be good for us to consider just for a few moments how we can imitate Jehovah

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.070
as a trainer.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:11.709
Now, in John chapter 5, in verse 20, Jesus drew attention to how Jehovah trained him personally.

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:16.989
And in that one little verse, we can learn three important lessons about training.

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:18.269
So let's give it our attention.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:25.750
Would you open your Bibles? Let's read together a John chapter 5 and verse 20.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:37.549
Now, you notice it says, for the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all the things he himself does.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.750
And he will show him works greater than these so that you may marvel.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:54.349
Well, now let's go back over this verse and see if we can find these three different lessons that we can learn about Jehovah as a trainer.

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.150
What's the first one?

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.269
Well, Jehovah trains others because he loves them.

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:06.750
Do you see what Jesus said for the Father has affection for the Son?

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.229
When how is training and expression of love for others?

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:21.830
Well, of course, training allows individuals to gain the experience that they need in order to be effective in their work,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.349
to be productive, and of course, if you're effective and productive, well, how do you feel?

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.830
Well, of course, you have real joy.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:39.870
We think back to what Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 30 says when it describes Jesus as the master worker.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.990
Do you remember what it says there?

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.150
It says, I was the one he was especially fond of day by day.

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.189
I rejoiced before him all the time.

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.270
Well, why?

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.270
Why could Jesus rejoice all the time before his Heavenly Father?

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.669
Well, he had been well-trained to do the work that Jehovah had instructed him to do.

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:12.509
Well, when we give training to our brothers and our sisters when they give new assignments and new jobs

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:17.349
so that they can be effective in their work, well, they rejoice too.

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.229
But have you ever had the other experience?

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:25.750
Have you ever been given a new assignment and you've not received adequate training?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.909
Well, immediately, what could have been a joy becomes a terrible trial,

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:37.509
because you may not know how to accomplish the task that's been set before you.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:43.870
Well, we can overcome that by showing love to the people that we're training, helping them,

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.509
so that they can be very effective in their task.

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:52.310
Well, what's the challenge that may occur here?

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.750
Many of us have years of experience in doing our jobs and doing the work that we do either

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.349
at Bethel or in the congregation.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.870
And it means that we have to resist the temptation to take on all the responsibility ourselves

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.949
or to want to do all the work ourselves.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.430
We need to allow younger people to be included.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.550
We have to allow them to learn and to benefit from our experience so that they can grow up

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.550
and take on more responsibility.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:34.149
If we're being honest, we have far more work than we can possibly accomplish in our own might and strength.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:39.629
And so love moves us to train others so that they can help.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.230
Do you remember what Jethro said to Moses in Exodus chapter 18 and verse 18?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.990
He said, you will surely wear out both you and this people who are with you,

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.149
because this is too big a load for you and you cannot carry it by yourself.

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.149
Well, that's true.

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:05.069
And so it's not just love of others that moves us to train.

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.069
It's even love of self, isn't it?

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.230
Because if we don't train others, we will give out.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.189
We won't be able to carry the load personally.

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.709
What's the second lesson that we learned from John 520?

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:21.029
Well, look at that second expression.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:28.910
Jesus said, and shows him all the things he himself does.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.350
Well, what's the point?

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:39.509
Well, obviously, Jehovah took the time to show Christ Jesus all the things that he himself does.

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.870
Well, what's the point?

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.470
We want to work closely with others and we want to show them all the things that we know,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.790
all of the things that we've come to learn.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:06:00.110
And this lesson is not just applied by Jehovah when he deals directly with one person like he did with Jesus,

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:05.629
but this kind of thinking governs all of the dealings that Jehovah has with mankind.

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:10.750
Take, for example, Exodus chapter 35 and verse 30.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.949
Now, look at this example.

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:18.509
Now, here, the work of the construction of the tabernacle had to move forward.

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:22.990
Now, how did Jehovah choose to handle it? Let's look.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.910
Then Moses said to the Israelites,

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:33.350
See, Jehovah has chosen Bezilell, the son of Uri, the son of her of the tribe of Judah.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:39.509
He has filled him with the spirit of God, giving him wisdom, understanding,

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.269
and knowledge of every sort of craftsmanship,

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:48.949
for making artistic designs, for working with gold, silver, and copper,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:56.990
for cutting and setting stones, and for making all kinds of artistic wood products.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.389
Now, in this regard, insight volume one, commenting on this verse, these verses,

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:14.709
says that Jehovah used his Holy Spirit to increase and sharpen the abilities of Bezilell and a Holy app.

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:22.550
But now, did Jehovah use that same Holy Spirit to increase the abilities of all of the workers

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.269
who would work on the project? No, instead, what did he do?

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:31.029
When I look at verse 34, it says,

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:35.990
And he has put into his heart to what?

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:42.709
To teach, he and a Holy app, the son of a Hisomac of the tribe of Dan.

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:49.750
So, Jehovah not only gave Bezilell and a Holy app abilities with craftsmanship,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.550
but he also gave them the ability to teach others.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:01.029
Now, brothers, what if you have developed some skill or some particular knowledge

00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:07.670
in some areas of the work? Learn from the example of Bezilell and a Holy app.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.910
Give the credit, give the glory to Jehovah for what you know.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:19.910
But honor Jehovah by teaching and training others to do all of the things that you're able to do.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:26.389
Now, for example, what if you're an oversteer at Bethel or you're an elder in the congregation?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.470
How wise you are if you take a moment and ask yourself,

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:37.269
are there tasks that I'm presently caring for that I don't need to do personally?

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.230
Could my assistant or some other brother care for these assignments?

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.669
Well, now that's true at Bethel, but it's also true in the congregation.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:55.750
We want our brothers who are moving ahead to feel that they have a place in the congregation

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.230
and that they're being trained. This is true even of our young ones.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:06.389
You know, sometimes the elders in the congregation can be so inventive in thinking of little assignments

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:12.070
that can be given to our young children who are have the potential in the future

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.309
to take on more responsibility. And how does it make those young ones feel?

00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:22.309
Well, they just look forward so much to coming to the kingdom hall because they feel they have a place.

00:09:23.669 --> 00:09:27.190
Well, now what's the third lesson that we can learn from John 520?

00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:33.029
It says, and he will show him works greater than these.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:39.429
Well, now what can we draw out of those few words? Well, Jehovah trained Jesus

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:44.870
with the thought of him taking on greater responsibility in the future.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:52.950
Well, we want to do the same. We want to help others to be able to grow and take on larger

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:58.070
responsibility in the future. For example, do you ask yourself questions like this?

00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:06.309
Who has the potential to be the next overseer or the next assistant overseer or the next crew leader

00:10:07.029 --> 00:10:13.350
or the next ministerial servant or the next elder? And if they're to have those assignments,

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.950
what training do they need right now so that they can reach those goals?

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:27.110
We want to imitate Jehovah and we want to look for opportunities so that we can help younger

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:39.509
ones to move ahead so that in the future they can take on those larger responsibilities.
