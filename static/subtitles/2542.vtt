WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:09.779
Now in a moment it'll explain what is going to be sensational, but first please open your bibles to

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.259
Hebrews chapter six or find it on your phone or

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:23.410
tablet. Now Paul here in this letter is addressing those with the heavenway hope

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.410
and he makes a point here about two things

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:37.899
he covers in verse 17 of Hebrews six, but the promise in the oath. So it's impossible for

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.179
Jehovah to lie, verse 18 touches on, but this is what's connected with this hope

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.899
for the ones that have the heavenly hope and by extension the other sheep. So

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:01.979
it's infallible, it's going to happen just as he promised. And Paul who at least three times

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.420
experienced shipwreck, that much we know, maybe find out there's more later, but notice

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:20.379
what he writes here with a heart full of experience in verse 19, we have this hope as an anchor.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.099
For the soul, both sure and firm, and it enters in within the curtain.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.900
The anchor, say, and it's just critical that the other sheep and the anointed

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:45.180
have their anchor in shape. Now the watchtower just last year, February 2021,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.420
on page 30 mentioned this profound thought. An anchor stabilizes a ship during a storm

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:04.540
and it stops it from drifting onto rocks, but an anchor is useful only if the chain that attaches to

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:14.539
the ship did not break. So if we lose our faith, we lose our hope. We watch the tower

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.979
trust that profound thought to all of God's people. Now for now, we're facing

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:30.219
with Revelation chapter 21, in symbolic language, we'll turn to Revelation 21,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:40.379
and this is why it's so critical to have that clear about our hope, being the anchor there.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.259
In verse 1 of Revelation 21, and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the former heaven

00:02:49.259 --> 00:03:01.740
and the former earth had passed away. Now notice, and this sea is no more. Well, the sea is no more.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.219
What are we talking about here? Well, that means that after Armageddon, there's no more sea.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:17.259
Well, obviously that's not literal with the oceans or the seas there. That's the demon agitated sea

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:29.819
of wicked mankind. Gone, but it's not gone yet. See, and just like in literal wars, submarines are used,

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:38.699
sneak up on the ships. Well, Satan's same way. Him and his demon horde. So

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:47.580
he's going to use any means he can try to wreck our ship. It's an individual one I want

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.300
with Jehovah, and you know, many of you, I look out to you, couples that very close, love each

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:03.740
other. Well, you know, your mate for those of you married has to have this kind of relationship

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:12.219
with their father, Jehovah. Everybody does. Unless you're a toddler, then you're going to be in

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:21.819
God's hands. If your parents are witnesses, that's a good chance you'll be okay. So this is war.

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:27.579
That's the point. This is war. And it's not going to get

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:39.100
easier. See, till the sea is no more. Now, during these times, this war we face stormy seas

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:45.980
includes a lot of things, loss of material things, a lot of kinds of other storms that come up,

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:53.740
and connected with the sea of wicked mankind. But this one here is what we're going to emphasize.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:11.180
The death of a loved one. The death of a loved one, what a storm. And that is when our anchor

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:22.769
is essential as individuals. That anchor is essential. Never lose your anchor.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.610
Not saying you're not going to be battered. I'm not going to be battered, but don't lose your anchor.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:42.209
Jehovah gave it to us, and Paul made that clear. Now, the sister wrote in, and I certainly

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.009
wouldn't name her. She may eventually see this program here, but thought it was worth

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.370
sharing with us. But she was honest and humble about it, but it shows, you know, God's people are

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.850
imperfect. I don't know if you notice that, but don't say anything, David, when they come out late.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:16.860
So her dad died faithful. Now, here's what she admits. Before her dad died, she says that when she saw

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:25.819
others shedding tears after loved ones died, she thought, why do people cry so much? They will see

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:40.019
them again. Would that comfort you if you just lost a loved one? No. However,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:54.430
her dad died. Here's what she honestly stated to her credit, but now I understand.

00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:06.350
And she wept shed tears. Yes, the loss of a loved one can be devastating. No,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:16.829
not about his credible storm. Now to our theme, they will be sensational. What is they?

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:28.430
They are family reunions in the new world. The things that are coming. Oh, go ahead and use

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:36.110
your imagination to hold a won't falter for that. They're going to be sensational. They really are.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:44.750
Now, another word for sensational is astonishing. Another one is astounding.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:52.589
And it's nice that this is not a fantasy. This is what's going to happen. It's a reality.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:08:01.550
So let's consider some families in Bible history, first of all, and we'll start with Noah.

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:12.990
And he was born in 2970 BCE, 126 years after Adam's death. So he didn't have any interaction

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:20.029
with Adam. I think he got a blessing there personally. And when his father,

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:28.189
Lamek named him Noah, you know, that's in scripture, he said, this one will bring us comfort from

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:33.470
our work and from the pain of our hands, resulting from the ground which Jehovah has cursed.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:42.379
Beautiful expression. And boy, Noah lived up to that. When he lived, he faced materialized angels.

00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:50.460
They left their proper dwelling place and produced offspring, those hybrid Nephilim.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:59.340
And the earth became full of violence. But no one is family. They avoided all of that corruption.

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:08.700
So he was fall asleep. He walked with the true God. Now he lived up to what Jehovah expected of him.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:17.899
And find Genesis, if you would please. And we're going to look at chapter 8, Genesis chapter 8.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:27.779
Now, I will mention this here in the chapter before 8, which would be chapter 7.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:37.809
We do find the point in verse 13 on that very day Noah went in at the ark along with his sons,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:44.850
Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and noticed in his wife and the three wives of his sons.

00:09:45.409 --> 00:09:51.490
So they went in the ark. They had all worked around it and everything. And now we find in chapter 8,

00:09:52.450 --> 00:10:00.129
verses 16 and 17, after the flood, go out of the ark,

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:11.169
you, your wife, your sons, and your sons' wives. So here we go. But we know that's a Shem, Ham,

00:10:11.169 --> 00:10:22.289
and Japheth, that's what the scripture said. We don't know the names of the wife or

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:32.259
the sons' wives. Why? You're going to ask God, but I don't see anything in here going to tell me why

00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:39.700
he decided not to have it in. Has nothing to do with being worthy. It's all about the lineage that

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:46.659
went through. And you know, we all know better than you know, argue with God. You know, God,

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:52.659
I really love your word, but you know, a couple of things here. Not too bright.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:01.700
Have that kind of attitude. So these are beautiful, faithful women. And here's the point,

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:09.620
during the New World, my, what a family reunion they're going to have.

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:17.299
And how thrilled you're going to be because I'm sure you've got some questions about what that

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:23.620
was like, you know, and then we don't have much while they were on the ark, how things go. I mean,

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:30.659
you know, a lot of the old timers hear it, Bethel and other Bethels have so many stories in there,

00:11:30.659 --> 00:11:40.580
a pleasure. Well, get ready. Whole lot of sensational stories from sensational family reunions

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:49.700
like this one. See, wonderful, wonderful future. Now in the same Bible book, Genesis, let's go over

00:11:49.700 --> 00:12:00.740
to chapter 21. And notice here, there's a different example of a family that'll enjoy a sensational

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:06.980
reunion in the New World. It highlights the fact that Sarah became pregnant. And this is the

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:17.779
love of Abraham's life as far as humans go. And they bore a son together, Isaac. And this is just

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:28.259
incredible. You take chapter 22 of Genesis. Jehovah gives this direction. And then

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:34.980
if you that are fathers or you're listening, and you don't have to be a father to be touched by

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:43.539
this, obviously, as you love Jehovah and you love Jesus. But he says in verse two, take please,

00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:53.779
your son, your only son whom you so love. Oh, yeah, he knew. Oh, Abraham sure loves Isaac.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:05.299
And this is remarkable. He knows he loves him so much. And what's he tell him to do? Sacrifice him.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:18.559
So we don't have all the or any record of any feelings that Abraham had during all this. We

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:27.120
get some indication of something is going on here. But those of you that have ever had a son or

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:39.090
sons, the impact is just phenomenal. He did go all the way with the knife. And he'd actually

00:13:40.049 --> 00:13:51.149
in mind and heart committed the sacrifice. But Jehovah, you know, after you reached out of the

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:59.389
knife and everything's in motion, Jehovah had the angel call out Abraham, Abraham just in time.

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:08.940
Stop the whole thing. And Abraham said, here I am. And then he told him in verse 12, do not harm the boy.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:18.059
How did he feel? Talk about a relief. And all this time before Isaac's wondering, you know, we

00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:26.779
get this all set up. Where's the sheep? I don't know. He must have some interesting conversations

00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:34.860
after these events. Now you think that they're not going to enjoy a sensational family reunion?

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:41.019
Oh, my. And then when they find out, because they didn't know, they heard certain things,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:52.860
Jehovah, he went all the way and allowed this sacrifice with his son. Oh, say that pain. A lot of

00:14:52.860 --> 00:15:02.220
pain. It's all sensational family reunion, Abraham, Isaac, Sarah, and other family members.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:10.059
Now another one in scripture. Let's find Job and how well we know and appreciate

00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:26.320
Job so much. And we're going to go right there to the first chapter. And it just helps us to

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:34.320
appreciate in the first chapter here. Verse 1 talks about this upright man of integrity. And

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:42.879
then verse 2 reveals it. Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. And then all the livestocks

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:50.559
mentioned. But this is quite interesting. In verse 4, chapter 1, each of his sons would hold a

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:58.480
banquet at his house on his own set day. What's that all about? Well, we have the gift of the

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.720
inside book. So so many other references, but there's always been a blessed gift.

00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:12.080
The inside stated, it would seem that Job's seven sons held a family gathering,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:20.159
possibly a spring or harvest festival. And as the feasting made the weeklong circuit,

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:28.690
each son hosted the banquet in his own house. That's a close family.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:37.889
They were all there. Just such a close family that loved each other. Just loved each other.

00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:47.809
However, we know in the following verses, the challenge of Satan and heaven and all that's recorded

00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:56.049
for us here. And then it starts in verse 13, sons and daughters are eating there. And then

00:16:57.009 --> 00:17:05.569
the message comes to Job about the cattle and Sabine's attacking. And then the wicked one,

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:13.089
whenever said he wasn't smart. Because he verse 16, fire from God. So now they're

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:20.210
involving going to blame God for this. Say, Satan, they're all going to think it was God did this.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:25.890
Even though he's behind it. And it falls from there and kills the sheep. Well, then

00:17:26.769 --> 00:17:34.049
verse 18 and 19, what is still speaking, your sons, your daughters were eating and drinking wine

00:17:34.049 --> 00:17:41.890
in their homeless brother's house. Suddenly a great win came. Apparently Job allowed that kind of

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:55.150
power in that case, killed them all, dead, killed them. So seven sons and three daughters.

00:17:56.269 --> 00:18:12.059
Now that's history. Let's go to Job 42, Job chapter 42. And see he's been through the test. And

00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:23.099
we find here where the mentions, you know, after things have passed here and Job doubled everything.

00:18:23.099 --> 00:18:31.420
And he's just rich again. Verse 13, he also of 42, 13, he also came to have seven more sons

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:42.380
and three more daughters. Isn't that, I mean, just Job was so wonderful. But see, Job was not finished

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:52.140
with them. Because in the new world, and likely work out the timing, all 20 children.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:19:04.369
Job was away. See how sensational family reunion. Now more to our day,

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:13.730
did just want to touch on, just saw it on the website. September 26, I think, beautiful,

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:19.569
beautiful story here. And it's been touched on within a week before. But this is David Mazza's life

00:19:19.569 --> 00:19:27.650
story. Happy family shattered and rebuilt. And they talk about Davey, David, or they call them Davey.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:36.769
I think I think, boy, what a sensational family reunion they're going to have. See, during the new

00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:45.410
world. So we know you precious brothers. A lot of you are numb of heart, losing loved ones during

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:55.490
these last days. But please don't lose heart. You got your anchor. See. And then the sister wraps it

00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:03.329
up for her dear friend of mine. My mother and father had 17 children. Just recently she wrote this.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:11.009
Recently, I lost the last remaining sibling, leaving me with no siblings at all.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.930
Strangely, I remember where I was and what I was doing when I lost each of them.

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:23.970
What a blessing it will be when these dreaded memories will be gone and replaced,

00:20:24.609 --> 00:20:31.730
when I see my resurrected mom and dad welcome back each child who stored in Jehovah's memory.

00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:39.569
She writes, what a grand reunion that will be. So as we gradually grow to perfection with the

00:20:39.569 --> 00:20:48.049
prospect of living forever. What a touching expression from our precious sister. So the reunion with

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:59.599
your loved ones is a certainty. You will be enjoying your family reunions soon. Keep your anchor in

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:07.519
good shape till the sea of wicked man kind is no more. And we entreat you focus on the coming

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:17.519
sensational family reunions.
