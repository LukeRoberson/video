00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.019
Christian wives. Are you happy? Do you love being a wife? Well, probably right now you're looking at your husband and saying,

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.219
of course, that's good. But could you add even more joy to your marriage?

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:30.620
You may be thinking, yes, if only my husband would and you finished the sentence. I think most husbands would admit we have some room for improvement.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:37.619
But this talk is for you. What can you do as a wife to add joy to your marriage?

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:50.619
Well, one of the first things is to think about your God assigned role. Open please to Genesis, chapter 2 and verse 18.

00:00:51.619 --> 00:01:00.619
Now here, Jehovah is going to explain why he was making a wife for Adam.

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:13.620
Then Jehovah God said, it is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him as a compliment of him.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:30.620
So Eve was going to be a helper as a compliment of Adam. What is a compliment? Well, we feel sure that you sisters know a lot about complimentary colors.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:42.620
When you go to pick out an outfit with accessories, you pick those with colors that blend well together, that are harmonious combination.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.620
Or when you are making a meal, you know there are certain foods that go well with other foods or compliment other foods.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:04.620
Like a Korean sister making kimchi probably will make rice or pasta with cheese, bacon and eggs, bread and butter.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.620
There are so many combinations that compliment one another.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:23.620
So when Jehovah God created Eve, he built into her feminine qualities that he knew would really work well with Adam's masculine qualities.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:32.620
So Adam and Eve had a prospect of being a perfectly matched couple.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:43.620
We could work well together. Eve could be fully happy in working with her husband and caring for that garden, a beautiful home God-gather.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.620
But of course we know that didn't happen because of sin. Along with sin came stress.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.620
And here we are, descendants of Adam and Eve. That's what we've got to, sin and stress.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.620
But Jehovah helps us, doesn't he? And he gives us principles that can help us make a happy marriage.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.620
Please open to Ecclesiastes.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.620
Now Ecclesiastes chapter 4, verse 9 and 10, describe what a partnership should be like.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.620
So wives, do you think of yourself as your husband's partner? Well let's read verse 9.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.620
2 are better than 1 because they have a good reward for their hard work.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:39.620
So your husband has made a decision. And maybe you think, hmm, I don't know if that's the best decision.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.620
But you're his partner. So how will you help him?

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.620
Well you're going to support that decision. You're going to try to make it work. And what will be your reward?

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.620
Well first of all, you're going to accomplish so much more working together than you could individually.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.620
But more than that, you're going to strengthen your friendship, your partnership with your husband.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.620
Now verse 10, it adds, for if one of them falls, the other can help his partner up.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.620
But what will happen to the one who falls with no one to help him up?

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:32.620
You may be thinking, well my husband's a strong man. And probably so. But inside he may be struggling with serious insecurities.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.620
At times he may feel like a failure. Maybe he's lost his job and feels like he's not a good provider.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.620
You're his partner. What are you going to do to lift him up?

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.620
Probably you're going to share with him some tactful words of comfort and encouragement.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:02.620
That'll be a happy place. The book of Proverbs contains much wisdom and some of it is directed to wives.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.620
For example, Proverbs 141.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:15.620
The truly wise woman builds up her house, but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:25.620
So if you are wise, you will build up or increase respect for your husband on the part of your children and of others.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:35.899
You don't want to be foolish by speaking negatively, talking about your husband's deficiencies or failures.

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:43.899
Nor would you want to undermine his own confidence by nagging or arguing with him.

00:05:43.899 --> 00:06:06.180
You can do so much to contribute to a happy house. For example, at mealtimes, sharing in the conversation, adding perhaps a spiritual gem you found in your Bible reading or nice experience or even a humorous story, something that will lift the spirits of the whole family.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:19.180
Now we want to go to Proverbs chapter 31 and probably right away you recognize this is the chapter that describes a capable wife.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.180
And I think all of you wives want to be that. You want to be that Proverbs 31 wife.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.180
When you read those verses, you realize this woman is very busy.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:48.180
She's out there buying household supplies, caring for the health and the welfare of her family, helping others in need, spending money wisely, diligently caring for all the duties of a wife, mother, friend and neighbor.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:59.180
We think many of you wives are doing all of those things and you do it day in and day out and you don't complain and you're happy.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:10.180
Happy because you're giving and then you're even happier when this happens in verse 28.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:17.180
Her children rise up and declare her happy. Her husband rises up and praises her.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:24.180
So they do appreciate what you do. Sometimes they may not express it, but they do appreciate it.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:31.180
There is another element to a very happy marriage and that's expressed in verse 11.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:43.519
Her husband trusts her from his heart and he lacks nothing of value. Trust is so important in a marriage.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:49.519
A wife must trust her husband and a husband must trust his wife.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:56.519
You're going to have conversations. You're going to express your innermost feelings and thoughts.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:08:05.519
You must not have fear that that's going to be shared with others or you'll be belittled in some way.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:11.519
Now that's trust, a very important aspect of marriage.

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:17.519
So you wives build up your friendship, your confidence with your husband.

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:26.519
Now in verse 12 it adds, she rewards him with good, not bad, all the days of her life.

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:37.519
So wives, reward your husband with good, support him in what he has to do and we know that he will love you all the more.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:43.519
It says all the days of your life. So all the days of your life build up that friendship with your husband,

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:46.519
whether he is a believer or not.

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:54.519
And we have to say in behalf of the thousands of hardworking elders and ministerial servants,

00:08:54.519 --> 00:09:02.519
without your faithful support, it would be much more challenging to care for our responsibilities.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:08.519
So thank you very much dear wives for what you're doing.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:13.519
Now sometimes you feel obliged to speak your mind.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:17.519
And in a trusting relationship that's expected.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:22.519
But how will you speak your mind? Notice verse 26.

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:29.519
She opens her mouth and wisdom. The law of kindness is on her tongue.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:36.519
So yes, you have something worthwhile to say, but how you say it is very, very important.

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:49.379
Will the law of kindness govern your tongue? If you say it in kindness your husband will love you all the more.

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:52.379
Finally let's read verse 30.

00:09:52.379 --> 00:10:01.379
Charm may be false, beauty may be fleeting, but the woman who fears Jehovah will be praised.

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:10.379
See above all, a capable wife who fears Jehovah is highly valued and is to be praised.

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:15.379
So you dear wives who feared Jehovah, you worship him with all and respect.

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:27.379
And that's so important because that helps you to easily be in subjection to your husband because you know that this pleases your Heavenly Father.

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:37.820
So as you watch the following dramatization, notice how the wife rejoices in her husband.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:54.750
I was so tired after work, but glad to finally get home until you got to be kidding me.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:01.710
You're home honey.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:08.059
I knew he had congregation stuff to work on, but seriously.

00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:10.059
You talk to me?

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:15.059
You were supposed to talk to the girls about this. They're making it a habit.

00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:32.500
At first it upset me he didn't say anything, but then I began to think it's actually something I've come to love about John.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:56.100
His patience, he doesn't overreact, he's thoughtful, concerned, he really listens.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:12.370
It's why he's such a good elder and why we've enjoyed so many blessings together.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:32.919
Sometimes I forget, I could be more patient.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:42.179
You know honey, you're right, this is completely unacceptable.

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:45.179
I'll talk to the girls as soon as they come through that door.

00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:48.179
Thank you, I love you.

00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:49.179
I love you too.

00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:56.100
Did you notice how the wife rejoiced in her husband?

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:07.100
Well, when she walked into that kitchen, she saw the mess, she wasn't rejoicing and she wanted to say something to her husband and she did.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.100
But how did she say it?

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.100
Did she yell at him?

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.100
No, she made her point.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.100
How did the husband react?

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.100
He didn't overreact.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.100
He let her think about it and he thought about it.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.100
And as she thought about it, she thought, you know, he didn't overreact.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.100
That's one of the things I love about my husband.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.100
He is so patient.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.100
And then of course, he talked with her and they resolved the issue.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:43.100
So love triumphed over any possible argument or anger.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:55.100
So continue dear wives, rely on Jehovah as you work to make your marriage a delight and Jehovah will bless and help you.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:09.100
Brother Gary Bro, a helper to the service committee will now present the next talk of this symposium, call of a joy in your family, parents, rejoice in your children.
