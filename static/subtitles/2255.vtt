Most people use electronic devices for things like homework, research, social networking,

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.280
entertainment and more.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.519
But if you're not careful, you could become overly attached to your devices.

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.559
You could even have withdrawal symptoms if you're away from your devices.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:31.039
This addiction could cost you your job.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.820
Your friends.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.450
Or more.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.409
Are you addicted to your device?

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.929
The Bible says to make sure of the more important things.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.689
So ask yourself these questions.

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:54.130
Do I become uneasy or irritated when I can't use my device?

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.770
Do I keep using my device longer than I intended to?

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.929
Am I losing sleep because I can't stop checking for messages?

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.209
Do my devices cause me to neglect my family?

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.650
What would my family say?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.209
If you answered yes to some or all these questions, don't give up.

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:13.530
It's not too late.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.090
Take back control.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.769
For example, set a time limit.

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:20.829
Then stick to it.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.269
When driving, keep your devices out of sight and reach.

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:29.989
Suggest that your family try phone stacking during a meal.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:34.629
The first one that reaches for it has to do the dishes.

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:39.870
Set aside a screen-free evening and keep your tech out of the bedroom.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.989
You'll sleep better.

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:47.769
The Bible says that two are better than one.

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:51.890
Ask a trusted family member or friend to help you make the needed changes.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.129
At 1 Corinthians 9.25, the Bible tells us to exercise self-control in all things.

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:02.930
So remember, you may live in a wired world, but it doesn't have to control you.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.489
Take breaks from your devices.

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.890
You'll be happier and enjoy more out of life.
