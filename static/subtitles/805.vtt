00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:12.009
We look forward to Brother Anthony Morris' thoughts presented in his talk entitled We Have Worked To Do.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:23.179
It was a great pleasure to hear all of the excitement when the Ramapo project was announced to all of you here.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.179
And I'm sure that was true for the other thousands that are tied in.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:36.179
And then you saw with these videos all the construction projects going on all over all over the year.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:45.179
So it's quite interesting you think about it now from an imperfect human perspective, frankly not thinking spiritually.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:54.179
You say, well, we just dedicated the warwick property along with Wallkill recently.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:01.070
Now here we go down the road.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.069
Well, the preaching work obviously is premier.

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:08.069
And that's what this is really about.

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:17.069
The preaching work to support the preaching work and to continue to feed Jehovah's precious sheep the way he wants them fed.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.069
It involves all this construction.

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:24.069
So God wants us to have it clear.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.069
We want you to spread this.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.069
And of course, it'll come up in January.

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.069
Keep in mind we have work to do.

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.069
Period.

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.069
So get over it.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.069
You know, don't get me going on vacation.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.069
I'll just tell you and I know my friends on the governing body.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.069
And not that you need your time.

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.069
I'm not trying to put you on a guilt trip, but it's we got a whole lot of these.

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.069
Because how do you with the work is going on?

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.069
You try to rest up when you can and Jehovah wants us to, but we have so much work to do.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.069
And we thank God for it.

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:11.069
So just to give us a little scriptural reminder of the proper attitude about work.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.069
Find John chapter five.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.069
And these are very familiar verses to all of you.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.069
Particularly the audience here at Newburg, all these decades of faithful service.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.069
We treasure your service.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.069
And of course, Jehovah certainly does.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.069
And you've worked hard for decades.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.069
A lot of you are talking to earlier decades in the traveling work.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.069
So many wonderful hardworking brothers and sisters.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.069
Jesus and John chapter five facing these judgmental religious leaders,

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.069
persecuting them over, curing on the Sabbath.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.069
Well, what we're after here is something he reveals to us in verse 17.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.069
When he's answering them,

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.069
my father has kept working until now.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.069
And I keep working.

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.069
So the hardest worker in the universe is Jehovah God and Christ Jesus is right there.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.069
With them, Jehovah is a worker.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.069
His people have to be workers.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.069
That's what he expects.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.069
And it's such a pleasure to serve the true God and work.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.069
And another familiar verse where his Corinthians chapter 15,

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:34.069
the proper spirit when it comes to this matter of being workers of all the work we have to do.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.069
And Jehovah's seen to it that we have all this work.

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.069
Very familiar, verse 58 of 1 Corinthians 15.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.069
Therefore, my beloved brothers,

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.069
be steadfast, immovable.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.069
Notice always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.069
knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.069
There's plenty of work in the work of the Lord.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.069
And then when we're doing the work,

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.069
and this is crucial as we engage in it,

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.069
whether it's the preaching work or other work assignments,

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.069
if you're in a Bethel assignment or a construction assignment,

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:18.069
there's a proper spirit.

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.069
And find here Romans chapter 12.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.069
And this we see in God's people.

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:28.069
And we want to individually apply the counsel,

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:32.069
make sure we keep this spirit or talk to God about it,

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.069
if it's lacking at the moment.

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.069
Romans chapter 12.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:43.069
And here's what Christians are all about when it comes to work for Jehovah.

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.069
Verse 11, be industrious.

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.069
Not lazy.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:54.350
Jehovah does not approve of lazy.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.350
He a glow with the spirit.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.350
See, he's just absorbed with it.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.350
There's this zeal, just alive with it as we slave for Jehovah.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.350
So he appreciates an industrious, hard working spirit,

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.350
and that's what he wants from his people.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.350
Now, with all of the announcements and the videos

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.350
with construction going on,

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.350
I just thought I'd share this with you.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.350
It's a very special item of mine,

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.350
and it comes up recently.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.350
You can see here, best you can, the camera can pick it up.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.350
And up here it says, building permit.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.350
And it's a special memory for me personally,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.350
because as we had in some of the videos,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.350
when we were involved with the construction,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.350
or before construction started with the Warwick project,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.350
we'd be at Tixedo, and a lot of work going on in preparatory

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.350
looking for that day when they could get started.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.350
So the governing body would do their best to get up

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.350
and be encouraging, always wearing high viz outfits,

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.350
and then give a spiritual talk.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.350
I think it's the only time I've given a talking high viz.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.350
And so this particular day was special,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.350
because things were moving along with the community they liked us.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.350
But I noticed Zenny in the one video,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.350
he mentioned Shovel to the ground,

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.350
and that's okay, we're different.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.350
I'm calling it Shovel in the ground.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.350
Zenny's not from America, so.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.350
It means the same thing, Zenny, so forgive me.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.350
You know, appreciate all your hard work.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.350
But any that have been involved with construction,

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.350
and you get a lot of folks,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.350
former regional building committee,

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.350
you know, all the hard work and construction,

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.350
and it's always been special to work on these spiritual projects.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.350
Well, this particular day,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.350
and there were a lot of things going on.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.350
So I'm up there, it's July 26th,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.350
and that date is up here in the corner.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:19.350
It's a Friday, and it's the year 2013, quite a while ago.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:28.350
So I have a talk to give to them at 1.30 after visiting some two hours before.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.350
So it must have been around 11.30,

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.350
they got the building permit.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.350
So the construction project committee,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.350
and how much we love those men and their wives,

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.350
they're there, they thought, well,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.350
would you mind making this announcement?

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.350
And I thought, boy, that timing worked out good.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.350
That's quite an honor, no.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.350
Construction, you know, in the shovel,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.350
in the ground announcement.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.350
So give those spiritual sides.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.350
You know, little glories are right for a human sometimes, you know.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.350
So it was very exciting, and then,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.350
the memory is clear, and those that were there,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.350
because the operation of Holy Spirit

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.350
and the brothers being a glow with the spirit, industrious,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.350
when they made the announcement,

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.350
I'm telling you, and those that were there,

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.350
the joy, the thunderous applause,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.350
and it wasn't anything to do with me,

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.350
it was they got the shovel in the ground,

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.350
and the excitement,

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.350
so I was able to easily walk out of there,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:44.350
and they're all busy thrilled over shoveling the ground approval.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.350
Now, days coming, God willing,

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.350
for the Ramapo project,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.350
to have shoveling the ground,

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.350
you heard when they hope that happens,

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.350
but it's just that beautiful spirit glorifies Jehovah

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.350
when they work so hard.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.350
And so we got to keep that spirit,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.350
and some of them say,

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.350
well, and it's happened on occasion,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.350
not a lot of God's spiritual-minded folks,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.350
but you believe the ends coming?

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.350
So what are you doing all this for?

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.350
If the ends are really close,

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.350
what are you doing?

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.350
Well, the ends are going to come

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.350
when Jehovah's satisfied with the preaching,

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.350
but it also a reminder here,

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.350
this is always something you can forget.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.350
I notice further,

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.350
Butler touched on it in his opening prayer,

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.350
which, of course, we don't record the prayers

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.350
for presentation January, but Bob touched on it.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.350
And Jehovah gives us enough to keep us focused on,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.350
and you just stay busy and do my will.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.350
However, this is quite fascinating.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.350
Chapter seven verses one through three.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.179
After this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners

00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:10.179
of the earth holding tight the four winds of the earth

00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:13.179
so that no wind could blow on the earth

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:16.179
around the sea or on any tree.

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:19.179
And I saw another angel ascending from the sunrise

00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:21.179
having a seal of the living God,

00:10:21.179 --> 00:10:24.179
and he called with a loud voice to the four angels,

00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:26.179
to whom was granted,

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:28.179
to harm the earth and the sea saying,

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:30.179
and it's loud,

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:33.179
do not harm the earth or the sea

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:35.179
or the trees until,

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:38.179
after we have sealed,

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:42.179
the slaves of our God in their foreheads.

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:43.179
Oh.

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:45.179
Now, some individual,

00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:49.179
anointed, they had to have a final seal

00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:51.179
before they died,

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:54.179
and we've had number of died during the last days,

00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:56.179
but this is talking about

00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:58.179
right before Jehovah's d'Arts,

00:10:58.179 --> 00:11:00.179
or has it in the hearts of the governments

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:02.179
to destroy Babylon,

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:04.179
that all of those that are left

00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:06.179
down near at the Remnant,

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:08.179
genuine, anointed disciples of Christ,

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:11.179
they get the final seal.

00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:13.179
And this is what's going to take place.

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:15.179
And then after that,

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:18.179
a great tribulation breaks out.

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:22.179
And you keep an eye on the news to some degree,

00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:24.179
if you can stomach it,

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:26.179
to at least know what's happening,

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:29.179
the end is definitely close.

00:11:29.179 --> 00:11:31.179
There's just no denying it.

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:34.179
We eagerly look forward to taking place

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:36.179
the great tribulation.

00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:38.179
It's close.

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:41.179
However, as we eagerly await,

00:11:41.179 --> 00:11:43.179
we want to have Jehovah's mind on the matter

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:45.179
and wait patiently.

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:48.179
And I think it was all of those here,

00:11:48.179 --> 00:11:51.179
because here at least the new bird,

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:53.179
so many years in the truth,

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.179
especially corporate members

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:57.179
and their mates, if they're married,

00:11:57.179 --> 00:12:00.179
this watchtower we want to share with you

00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:04.179
from 1976, profound statements.

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:07.179
Just to this day, they ring true

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:10.179
about this matter of the end.

00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:12.179
It shows you where we are,

00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:14.179
in the stream of time,

00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:16.179
and Jehovah's spirit was on him,

00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:18.179
not inspired, but he captured it

00:12:18.179 --> 00:12:20.179
with them, helping them,

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:22.179
and it was just ringing,

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:23.179
to this day.

00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:27.179
Now notice what that 76th November 15th watchtower

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:31.179
said, pages 688, 689.

00:12:31.179 --> 00:12:33.179
And in the 17th paragraph,

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:34.179
notice quoting it,

00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:36.179
the end does not come just

00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:39.179
because we might think it is the due date,

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:44.179
or because we feel that our territory has been well-worked.

00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:46.179
It comes when Jehovah has carried

00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:48.179
through the great work of kingdom preaching

00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:51.179
to the extent he wants.

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:55.179
And then he will bring the great tribulation.

00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:58.179
Now listen, back 1976,

00:12:58.179 --> 00:13:02.179
until that time there is work to do.

00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:05.620
And we as Jehovah's Witnesses

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.620
are the ones assigned to do it.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.620
The arrival of the great tribulation

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.620
should find the preaching work

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.620
at the height of its forward movement,

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.620
at the very peak of its momentum

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.620
throughout the earth.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.620
The arrival of the Lord Jesus

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.620
to execute judgment will come

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.620
as a complete surprise

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.620
even to Jehovah's people.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.620
For it will no doubt

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.620
find them at their busiest time of activity.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.860
Think about it.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.860
You've been busier since you've been in the truth

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.860
than recently.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.210
It's all where the busiest we've been.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.210
Hands down.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.210
So it's amazing how the slave captured

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.210
that right attitude in 1976.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.210
Of course, some in the truth,

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.210
there are at least certain parts of the earth.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.210
They're thinking the end is coming in 75.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.210
And look at all the growths in the 70s.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.210
You have about two million back in the 70s

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.210
that were witnesses of the true God.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.210
Now we're approaching nine million.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.210
So in conclusion, there's closing thoughts.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.210
And this is priceless from that same watchtower.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.210
Jehovah's Advancing Theocratic Society

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.210
will be a going concern,

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.210
a go forward organization

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.210
right down to and through the great tribulation.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.210
So I've told brothers for a long time

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.210
the recent changes from RBC to work.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.210
This is all new world construction going on here.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.210
You're taking this over?

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.210
After I'm again, you're going to just keep on working.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.210
And others will be trained.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:58.210
And then the further the worship of God,

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.210
the watchtower said is with spirit and truth

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.210
is positive, enthusiastic,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.210
spirited and progressive.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.210
And then this is profound,

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.210
more and more sections of the earth and western lands

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.210
in the orient and elsewhere

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.210
are now receiving a thorough witness.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.210
And who knows how much farther

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.210
the glorious good news will be sounded before the end?

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.210
Well, God knows.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.210
And look at the sound of the good news being

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.210
all over the earth, most distant parts of the earth.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.210
So may all of us beg Jehovah

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.210
to continue to empower us,

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.210
to keep worshiping him with spirit and truth,

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.210
enthusiasm and zeal

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.210
because we have work to do.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:57.299
Thank you, Brother Morris.

00:15:57.299 --> 00:16:00.299
In the words of 1 Chronicles 28,

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:05.299
10, we will be courageous and go to work.

00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:07.299
At this time we ask the question,

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:10.299
what do we have to fear?

00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:14.299
Brother Mark Sandison will address that question now for us.

00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:19.840
At Revelation chapter 12 and verse 17,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.840
the Bible makes clear that all of God's people,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.840
every one of you here in this room

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.840
and every servant of God around this earth

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.840
who support Jehovah's anointed ones,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.840
are in a war.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.840
Now read this thought with me.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.840
Revelation chapter 12 and verse 17.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.840
It says,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.840
So the dragon became enraged at the woman

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.840
and went off to wage war

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.840
with the remaining ones of her offspring

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.840
who observed the commandments of God

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:03.840
and have the work of bearing witness concerning Jesus.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.839
Well, what does it mean?

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:08.839
As our dear brother Morris would say,

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.839
cheer up, things are only going to get worse.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:19.619
Well, if we are in this spiritual war,

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.619
what do we expect?

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:26.619
With every war comes intense,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.619
intense hatred.

00:17:29.619 --> 00:17:32.619
Not surprisingly, Jesus made it clear

00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:35.619
that his servants would not just be disliked,

00:17:35.619 --> 00:17:38.619
but what did Jesus say?

00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:43.619
Let's read it together, Matthew chapter 24 and verse 9.

00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:50.420
Matthew chapter 24, verse 9.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.420
He said,

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.420
Then people will hand you over to tribulation

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.420
and will kill you

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.420
and you will be hated by all the nations

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.420
on account of my name.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.420
So brothers, what do we expect?

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.420
We expect the hatred of all.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.420
Jesus said, all the nations.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.420
Not just Eritrea,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.420
not just Russia,

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.420
all the nations.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.420
But there is something else that we also must expect in a war.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.420
There is a very famous quote that says,

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.420
in war, the first casualty is truth.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.420
And that is exactly what Jesus warned

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.420
would happen to God's people.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.890
Read it, Matthew chapter 5,

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.890
Matthew chapter 5 and verse 11.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.890
He said, happy are you when people reproach you

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.890
and persecute you and then notice this.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:01.890
And lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.890
against you for my sake.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.890
Brothers, what's the point?

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.890
We are in a war.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:19.890
And we expect to be hated by all the nations.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.890
And we expect that people will say every sort

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.890
of wicked thing against us.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.890
Well, with that in mind,

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.890
it's good for us to ask this question.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.890
What do we have to fear?

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.890
Well-known statesman Franklin Roosevelt said,

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.890
the only thing that we have to fear is fear itself.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.890
Well, he's not completely correct.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.890
But there's certainly a note of truth in what he said.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.890
You see, fear is a powerful weapon

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.890
in the hand of our great adversary, Satan the devil.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.890
He will use that weapon against us

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.890
and what is the danger?

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:10.890
You see, brothers, when we are afraid or we are terrified,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:15.890
we can then be controlled by our enemies.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.890
The Apostle Paul made this very clear in what he said here

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.890
in Hebrews the second chapter.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.890
We read this with me, please.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.890
Let's look at Hebrews chapter 2.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.299
Let's look at verse 14.

00:20:29.299 --> 00:20:32.299
He says, therefore, since the young children are shares

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:35.299
of blood and flesh,

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:38.299
he also similarly shared in the same things.

00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:42.299
So that through his death, now notice this,

00:20:42.299 --> 00:20:45.299
through his death, he might bring to nothing

00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:48.299
the one having the means to cause death.

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:50.299
That is the devil.

00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:53.299
And that he might do what?

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:56.299
That he might set free all those

00:20:56.299 --> 00:21:00.299
who were held in slavery all their lives

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:04.299
by their fear of death.

00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:07.299
You see, the Apostle Paul praised Jehovah

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:11.299
for the gift of Christ Jesus and why?

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:14.299
Because he knew that all of those who would put faith

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:17.299
in the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus

00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:19.299
would be set free.

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:22.299
But set free from what?

00:21:22.299 --> 00:21:29.299
Paul says, from the slavery to the fear of death.

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:32.299
Now, why is that significant?

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:36.299
You see people who are in fear of death

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:39.299
are constantly afraid.

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:43.299
And as a result, they can be manipulated and controlled.

00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:46.299
Now, take, for example, the Nuremberg trials

00:21:46.299 --> 00:21:49.299
that occurred at the end of the Second World War.

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:54.299
Various Nazis who had committed horrible, terrible atrocities

00:21:54.299 --> 00:21:56.299
were brought to justice.

00:21:56.299 --> 00:21:59.299
And when these individuals, both men and women,

00:21:59.299 --> 00:22:05.299
asked the simple question, how could you do these terrible things?

00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:07.299
What did they say?

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:09.299
We had no choice.

00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:14.299
If we didn't obey, they would put us to death.

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:17.299
Those people could be manipulated.

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:19.299
They could be controlled.

00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:23.299
They could even get them to do the most wicked things

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:26.299
because they were afraid.

00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:29.299
When we have complete confidence

00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:32.299
in our amazing God, Jehovah,

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:35.299
when we have put our full confidence

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:40.299
in the ransom sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ,

00:22:40.299 --> 00:22:45.299
we can do what the Apostle Paul says here in Philippians 1.

00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:47.299
Will you read it?

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:52.829
With me, Philippians 1 and verse 28.

00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:56.109
Paul says,

00:22:56.109 --> 00:23:03.109
And in no way, being frightened by your opponents,

00:23:03.109 --> 00:23:08.109
this very thing is a proof of destruction for them,

00:23:08.109 --> 00:23:11.109
but of salvation for you.

00:23:11.109 --> 00:23:15.109
And this is from God.

00:23:15.109 --> 00:23:18.109
You see, brothers, that confidence in Jehovah

00:23:18.109 --> 00:23:23.109
and in the ransom sacrifice of Christ can set us free

00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:27.109
so that we are not afraid of our opponents.

00:23:27.109 --> 00:23:32.109
But another thing that can help us to overcome the fear

00:23:32.109 --> 00:23:36.109
of persecution is realizing something very important.

00:23:36.109 --> 00:23:40.109
And that is that Jehovah will allow our enemies

00:23:40.109 --> 00:23:43.109
to only go so far.

00:23:43.109 --> 00:23:47.109
Now, you remember the text in 1 Corinthians chapter 10.

00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:49.109
Now, let's read this.

00:23:49.109 --> 00:23:54.900
Verse chapter 10 and verse 13.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.900
The Apostle Paul says,

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.900
No temptation has come upon you except what is common demand.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.900
But God is faithful.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.900
And he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.900
But along with the temptation,

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.900
he will also make the way out,

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.900
so that you may be able to endure it.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.900
See, that's a promise from our God, Jehovah.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:26.900
He will only allow our enemies to go so far.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.900
In a well-known illustration from a book

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.900
that was written in the 1600s,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.900
it shows a path that leads off to the final goal.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.900
And on either side of the path, there are lions.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.900
The caption to the illustration says,

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.900
The lions were chained,

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.900
but he didn't see the chains.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.900
Now, what's the point?

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.900
You see, we may encounter lions along our path

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.900
on our journey to the new world.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.900
But what do we need to remember?

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.900
Every one of those lions is chained.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.900
And so we must look not at the lions, brothers,

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.900
but the chains.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.900
And as we concentrate on the fact that Jehovah loves us,

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.900
that he loves his people,

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.900
and that he will never allow Satan or his agents

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.900
to do anything that will permanently harm us,

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:39.900
our fear of our persecutors begins to dwindle away.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.900
When you see the lion, remember,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:48.900
don't stare at the lion, stare at the chain.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.900
So then, brothers, I come back to the question.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.900
What then do we have to fear?

00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:00.180
Well, the Bible tells us it's here in Psalm 111.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:04.180
Psalm 111 and verse 10.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:13.000
It says, The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
All those observing his orders show good insight.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
His praise endures forever.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Well, that's what we do have to fear.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
We have to have a wholesome fear of our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
That wholesome fear of displeasing the Almighty God of the universe

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
is our compass.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
It shows us the way.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
It tells us what we need to do.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
No matter how much opposition may come upon us.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
No matter what form that opposition may take,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
if we are God-fearing men and women,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
we will know exactly what we need to do.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Do you agree?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:06.210
Now, brothers, this is not theory.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.210
Our brothers and sisters around the world

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.210
are living examples of the truths that we have just discussed.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:18.210
Please watch the following video that contains heartfelt comments

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:22.210
from persecuted brothers and sisters in Russia

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:30.319
and see why we have no reason to fear persecution.

00:27:30.319 --> 00:27:34.319
I was horrified when several masked officers broke down

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:38.319
two doors and burst into the home where the meeting was being held.

00:27:38.319 --> 00:27:41.319
Everything happened at once.

00:27:41.319 --> 00:27:46.319
How it sounds, noise, the order, everyone sit on the floor.

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:54.509
I was overcome with fear when they put me in handcuffs,

00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:57.509
blessed me in the police fan and took me to jail.

00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:02.509
I was afraid because I didn't know how long I would be there

00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:04.509
and what was awaiting me.

00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:06.509
When I was being interrogated,

00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:09.509
I was afraid that I might be unfaithful to Jehovah

00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:11.509
and let my brothers down.

00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:16.509
After being detained, I was mostly afraid about what I would face in prison,

00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:23.509
whom I would encounter, how to act, how others would treat me, the unknown.

00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:33.220
When one of the officers began to describe how bad life is behind bars,

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.220
I imagined that behind the officer stood an angel

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.220
just like the one who supported Daniel in the illustration.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.220
This helped me to calm down, not panic or be afraid.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.980
That's how Jehovah supported me.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.980
At the first court of hearings, when I was brought out,

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.980
the broadest feelings impelled them to show supports on how

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.980
and they began implawning.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.980
How that encouraged me that they were with me.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.980
It was kind of so safe.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.980
Fervent and sincere prayers to Jehovah

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.980
helped me to cope with these fears.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.980
Isaiah 30-15 gave me much support.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.980
I realized that tranquility and trust in Jehovah

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.980
are now the most important things,

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.980
understanding this made things much easier for me.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.980
We took the elevator down to the first floor,

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:28.980
the doors open, and there stood a large crowd of our brothers and sisters,

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.980
and they all began clapping.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.980
When I saw that, my emotions just welled up

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.980
and I got a lump in my throat.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.980
I felt as if I had wings.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.980
I felt the great cloud of witnesses.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.980
I prayed to Jehovah for calmness, courage and wisdom,

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.980
and that he helped me not to bring reproach on his holy name.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.980
Almost immediately, the peace of God came over me,

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.980
and I was calm.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.980
The unpleasant sensations did not go away,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.980
but I was no longer afraid.

00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:11.859
While overcoming our fear, my wife and I

00:30:11.859 --> 00:30:14.859
tried to go out and service every day.

00:30:14.859 --> 00:30:16.859
When you don't concentrate on yourself

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:22.430
but focus on helping others, fear disappears.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:26.430
Something that helped me to cope with my fears is hope.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.430
Looking at the situation through Jehovah's eyes,

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.430
seeing what will happen next.

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.430
That this is not the end of the situation,

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.430
but only a difficult phase through which you can pass.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:45.029
I was helped to cope with my fear by the words of the song.

00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:47.029
Take one day at a time.

00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:49.029
Leave tomorrow until tomorrow.

00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:52.029
Peace is what I find.

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:55.029
I understood that it was important to solve problems

00:30:55.029 --> 00:31:00.029
as they came up and not to be troubled by what might never happen.

00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:02.029
Fear is interesting.

00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:06.029
That is, in principle, fear can be inside a person

00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:10.029
and if someone is afraid, that is not shameful.

00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:14.029
But the question is, can you overcome this fear?

00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:17.029
Can you get the fear under your control?

00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:21.029
Can you overcome the surge of negativity?

00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:24.029
And when my heart persuaded me to get scared,

00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:27.029
then I started to pray.

00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:30.029
I prayed to Jehovah to give me courage

00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:33.029
and not be afraid of anyone or anything.

00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:35.029
I still say to myself,

00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:40.029
Felix, do not fear anybody or anything except Jehovah.

00:32:01.299 --> 00:32:41.190
Brothers and sisters, we know

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:44.190
that persecution is coming to us

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.190
too.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.190
May we trust in Jehovah

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.190
and overcome any fear that we have of our opposers.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:57.190
May we be confident that any lions on our path are chained.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:02.190
Look at the chains, not the lions.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:07.190
And may we be ever guided by our wholesome fear of Jehovah God.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:13.190
Are you determined to fear nothing except our wonderful God, Jehovah?

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:27.569
Then I ask you, what do we have to fear?

00:33:27.569 --> 00:33:32.569
Thank you for answering this question about fear so eloquently.

00:33:32.569 --> 00:33:38.569
Now we are looking forward to the discussion by brother Jackson

00:33:38.569 --> 00:33:40.569
on the interesting theme.

00:33:40.569 --> 00:33:44.569
Are you completely sober?

00:33:44.569 --> 00:33:51.119
I guess so, looking at the time.

00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:54.119
Are you completely sober?

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:57.119
I know what you are thinking, really?

00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:59.119
Seriously?

00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:01.119
The answer is obvious, isn't it?

00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:03.119
We have been in this assembly hall for hours

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:07.119
and there is no opportunity to drink.

00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:11.119
So the answer to the question seems rather obvious, doesn't it?

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:15.119
But before you dismiss this question completely,

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:20.119
could there be some other meaning to this question?

00:34:20.119 --> 00:34:22.119
A spiritual meaning?

00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:25.119
The answer, of course, is yes.

00:34:25.119 --> 00:34:29.119
Because when we look at the Greek text upon which the Christian Greek

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:35.119
scriptures was translated from, we notice that literally the term

00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:39.119
to be sober occurs a number of times.

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:43.119
And yet the Christian Greek scriptures of the New World translation

00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:46.119
does not actually use the word to be sober.

00:34:46.119 --> 00:34:48.119
Now let's take an example.

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:56.119
Please turn with me, if you will, to 1st Peter, chapter 1 and verse 13.

00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:59.119
Now if you have a device, you can quickly also look at the

00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:03.119
Kingdom of Interlinear if you wish to verify this.

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:06.119
But 1st Peter, chapter 1, verse 13.

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:09.119
And just the beginning of the verse.

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:12.119
It says, so brace up your minds for activity.

00:35:12.119 --> 00:35:17.119
Keep your senses completely.

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:24.119
The Greek expression here could be translated as being sober perfectly.

00:35:24.119 --> 00:35:31.119
But notice we have the expression translated as keep your senses completely.

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:34.119
So that raises the interesting question.

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:40.119
Why didn't the New World Translation Bible Committee say to be sober,

00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:43.119
or to be completely sober?

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:47.119
Well, the answer to that question goes back to your initial reaction when you

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:49.119
heard the title of this talk.

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:50.119
Let's be honest.

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:52.119
When you heard, are you completely sober?

00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:55.119
What did you think of immediately?

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:58.119
Drinking alcohol or avoiding it?

00:35:58.119 --> 00:36:03.119
But the majority of times that this expression occurs in the Christian Greek

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:08.119
scriptures, it does not specifically refer to avoiding alcohol,

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:11.119
or becoming intoxicated with alcohol.

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:16.119
Rather, it has a larger figurative meaning.

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:21.119
So for us to follow the admonition, to be sober,

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:25.119
we need to know really what the Bible means by that expression.

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:27.119
What is included in that?

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:32.119
So what we're going to briefly do is look at four different ways

00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:38.119
that the New World Translation has covered this verse or, sorry, this expression.

00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:43.119
And by looking at the different ways in English that this has been translated,

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:49.119
we'll see what really is involved with this expression to be sober.

00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:50.119
So let's start.

00:36:50.119 --> 00:36:55.119
If you turn with me, please, to 1 Timothy chapter 3.

00:36:55.119 --> 00:37:01.119
And immediately we remember the 1 Timothy chapter 3 is talking about the qualifications

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:06.119
for overseers, and also it mentions what sisters should do.

00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:11.119
Now in verse 2 and verse 11, we won't read it, but glancing at it,

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:17.119
in Greek, the word to be sober literally is there.

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:20.119
And you can see it in the Kingdom of Interlinear.

00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:21.119
But how is it translated?

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:23.119
We don't see the word sober, do we?

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:28.119
The expression there is to be moderate in habits.

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:31.119
Now why did the brothers translate it this way?

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:37.119
Because although it could refer to being avoiding being intoxicated,

00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:44.119
it has this wider meaning of having good sense when it comes to things like conduct and speech,

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:48.119
or the choice of entertainment or recreation.

00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:54.119
It means not going to foolish extremes or being erratic in our thinking

00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:57.119
or unbalanced in our opinions.

00:37:57.119 --> 00:38:02.119
So all of that is involved in this figurative meaning of the expression

00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:04.119
to be moderate in habits.

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:08.119
Let's take an example by looking at another verse in the Bible

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:12.119
as to what is involved in not being extreme.

00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:16.119
Let's turn to 1 Corinthians this time.

00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:21.119
1 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 31.

00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:24.119
Now this doesn't use the term in Greek to be sober,

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:30.119
but it gives us further information as to what's involved with being moderate in habits.

00:38:30.119 --> 00:38:33.119
So verse 31 says,

00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:40.119
those making use of the world as those not using it to the full.

00:38:40.119 --> 00:38:42.119
Now what does that mean?

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:46.119
Well maybe we could use this illustration to highlight it.

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:51.119
Imagine a hungry person who wants to pick fruit from a tree.

00:38:52.119 --> 00:38:56.119
Now a person who's not unbalanced doesn't go to extremes,

00:38:56.119 --> 00:39:01.119
perhaps would be happy just to get enough fruit to satisfy his hunger.

00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:07.119
Or maybe to get a few extra pieces of fruit so that he could take home.

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:11.119
But a person who was to use it to the full

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:17.119
is that type of person that after they've collected everything they can get

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:19.119
more than they could ever use.

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:22.119
They see the one piece of fruit right up at the top

00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:24.119
and they have to have it,

00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:28.119
even if it involves a certain risk.

00:39:28.119 --> 00:39:32.119
So when the apostle Paul said under inspiration

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:36.119
that we shouldn't use the world to the full,

00:39:36.119 --> 00:39:39.119
symbolically we could say it's just like this,

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:43.119
not trying to get everything out of this world.

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:47.119
Now what sort of symbolic fruit might we be tempted with?

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:51.119
Well there are so many opportunities today for education,

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:57.119
recreation, entertainment, travel, vacations, employment and business.

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:02.119
Are we truly sober when it comes to those things?

00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:07.119
Or are we like the person who's trying to grab every opportunity

00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:10.119
and use the world to the full?

00:40:10.119 --> 00:40:15.119
Well let's look at a second example of this Greek word being used.

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:20.119
First Peter chapter four and verse seven.

00:40:20.119 --> 00:40:23.119
First Peter four seven.

00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:26.119
It says, but the end of all things is drawn close.

00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:31.119
Therefore be sound in mind and be vigilant.

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:36.119
Now notice the footnote says, or alert or awake.

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:41.119
But if you look at the kingdom in Thelinia it says be you sober.

00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:47.119
So in this case the brothers translated the literal term in Greek sober

00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:51.119
to be vigilant or alert and awake.

00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:53.119
With regard to what?

00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:55.119
With regard to our prayers.

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:59.119
It's interesting that the apostle Peter was inspired to say these words.

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:03.119
No doubt he remembered the time when he wasn't vigilant with regard to prayers.

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:08.119
When Jesus said keep praying constantly in the Garden of Gesemini

00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:13.119
and of course Peter would have remembered what resulted because of that lack

00:41:13.119 --> 00:41:16.119
of being sober in a spiritual sense.

00:41:16.119 --> 00:41:18.119
So what about us?

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:21.119
Are we vigilant with regard to prayers?

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:27.119
Do we pray to Jehovah constantly whenever we have an opportunity right through the day?

00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:31.119
Or do we only just pray when we wake up in the morning, when we eat

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:34.119
and before we go to bed at night?

00:41:34.119 --> 00:41:38.119
Well for us to be vigilant with regard to prayers,

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:41.119
if we constantly have Jehovah in our minds,

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:46.119
then we can truly say that we are in a symbolic sense sober.

00:41:46.119 --> 00:41:52.119
Now a third example, first Corinthians chapter 15.

00:41:52.119 --> 00:41:59.119
Of course all of us remember very clearly the words in verse 33 about bad associations.

00:41:59.119 --> 00:42:04.119
But this verse is verse 34 in the same context.

00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:06.119
And how does it start?

00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:11.119
It says come to your senses in a righteous way.

00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:17.119
Again if we look at the literal rendering of the Greek it says sober you up.

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:20.119
Now what is this talking about?

00:42:20.119 --> 00:42:26.119
Well the study note of our Bible and of course you can only get this in the electronic form at the moment.

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:29.119
It says come to your senses.

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:34.119
Paul here uses a Greek word that literally means to sober up

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:39.119
because some of the Corinthian Christians gave ear to apostate teachings

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:42.119
such as the denial of the resurrection.

00:42:42.119 --> 00:42:49.119
They were in a spiritual stupor of sorts, confused and disoriented as if drunk.

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:53.119
Paul thus urges them to wake up to shake off their confusion

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:58.119
by getting a clear understanding of the teaching of the resurrection.

00:42:58.119 --> 00:43:05.119
They needed to do so before their stupor led them to spiritual sickness and even death.

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:09.119
So do we see why the brothers translated this way?

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:14.119
Come to your senses. It's not just looking talking about drinking wine or beer

00:43:14.119 --> 00:43:22.119
but it's talking about avoiding bad associates and those that give wrong ideas.

00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:27.119
So could it be that we may be affected by the opinions of some,

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:32.119
maybe even within the congregation who say is the end really so close?

00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:37.119
Or is what the world offers really that bad?

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:43.119
Or if we were to be tempted to believe every account or report on the Internet

00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:47.119
with regard to those taking the lead in the organization?

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:50.119
Do we just quickly believe those things?

00:43:50.119 --> 00:43:55.119
Or were still do we search the Internet looking for juicy stories

00:43:55.119 --> 00:43:58.119
about other Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:43:58.119 --> 00:44:01.119
We need to remember Satan is a father of the lie.

00:44:01.119 --> 00:44:07.119
He's an expert at lying and he makes sure there are plenty of lies first to come across.

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:16.119
But if we are sober spiritually, this means we won't get fooled or tricked by false stories.

00:44:16.119 --> 00:44:22.119
Now the fourth and final example we want to share with you is in 1 Thessalonians.

00:44:22.119 --> 00:44:27.119
1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 6.

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:31.119
And here again in the Greek text we see the word sober,

00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:35.119
if it's literally translated into English.

00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:39.119
Verse 6 says, so then let us not sleep on as the rest do,

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:45.119
but let us stay awake and notice this is the expression, keep our senses.

00:44:46.119 --> 00:44:49.119
So what is the context of this verse?

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:52.119
It's talking about Jehovah's Day coming as a thief.

00:44:52.119 --> 00:44:56.119
It's talking about those saying peace and security.

00:44:56.119 --> 00:45:01.119
So in this sense to be sober means we know the time we're living in.

00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:04.119
We're not only spiritually awake but we're alert.

00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:06.119
I think of this illustration.

00:45:06.119 --> 00:45:11.119
There could be a God and that God is totally awake.

00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:17.119
But he's watching the tournament on the television, maybe it's the football.

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:23.119
Something he's excited with, he's not alert to the dangers that are lurking.

00:45:23.119 --> 00:45:31.119
So in a similar way, we need to be totally awake spiritually and alert to what is happening,

00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:39.119
to the dangers that present themselves, such as getting involved with the political issues that we see in the world today.

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:42.119
To do so would make us part of the world.

00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:47.119
Yes, we have to focus on God's kingdom as the only true solution.

00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:50.119
That's what it means to be sober.

00:45:50.119 --> 00:45:59.119
So we've seen those four aspects of this literal word when it translated into English as being sober.

00:45:59.119 --> 00:46:01.119
But why is that so important?

00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:06.119
Brothers and sisters, as has been already presented on this program,

00:46:06.119 --> 00:46:11.119
we know challenging times are in front of us.

00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:18.119
Yes, we need to be completely sober when we face those challenges.

00:46:18.119 --> 00:46:27.119
This year is a special year, it marks 100 years since the appointment of the faithful and discrete slave.

00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:35.119
That slave, when we look back over the 100 years, has remained awake spiritually speaking and alert

00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:39.119
and keeping on reminding us of the need to do that.

00:46:39.119 --> 00:46:44.119
Now it's true, some might say, well, yes, but at times we look back over the 100 years,

00:46:44.119 --> 00:46:50.119
there were times I got excited about a certain year of time and the end didn't come at that time.

00:46:50.119 --> 00:46:56.119
But just imagine if you had a watchdog and that dog barks in the middle of the night

00:46:56.119 --> 00:47:02.300
and you get up and there's nothing there, do you shoot the dog?

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:07.300
It only proves that the dog is doing what you want it to do.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:11.300
So in a similar way, realize the faithful slave.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:18.300
Yes, in the enthusiasm, sometimes we have said things that maybe disappointed others.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:26.300
But remember, the role of the faithful and discrete slave is to feed us, to keep us awake spiritually and keep us alert.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:35.300
And thinking about it, when that day comes, when Jesus brings destruction on this wicked system of things,

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:46.300
where do you want to be on a beach drinking a martini, climbing a symbolic tree to get the last bit of fruit from this world,

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:53.300
or do you want to be busy in Jehovah's service, whether it's building and preaching and all the things we need to do, we know the answer.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:59.300
Yes, but to do that, we have to remain sober spiritually.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.300
And one final point.

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:07.300
If we look in the inside volume under the heading sobreness, there's a very interesting point.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:13.300
Because Peter and Paul use this expression in Greek.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.300
And the inside volume makes this very interesting comment.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:25.300
In keeping his senses, Timothy was to realize that Paul would not be on the scene much longer.

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.300
Then it says about Peter.

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:33.300
Peter likewise knew that he and his fellow apostles would not be on hand much longer.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:40.300
Then he goes on to say, knowing the seriousness of the times, with growing persecution from the world,

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:52.300
they should be sound in mind, watchful, vigilant, and should not neglect serious prayer to obtain the strength that they would need for endurance.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:58.300
Yes, the faithful slave has been serving us with spiritual food for 100 years.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:04.300
But friends, remember, the faithful slave will not always be here.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:11.300
Soon will come the time when the remaining ones of the anointed will be taken to have their reward.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.300
Of course, Jehovah will continue to care for us.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.300
He always has a provision in place to care for us.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.300
But what is the important thing?

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.300
What is it that the faithful slave wants to convey to us?

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:30.300
Just the same as Paul and Peter wanted to convey to those to whom they wrote.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:39.300
We want to convey to you the importance of each one of us, being moderate in habits, vigilant with regard to prayers,

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:46.300
keeping our senses not being distracted by false stories and being alert to the time in which we are living.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.300
So we leave you with that question.

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.300
Are you sober?

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.300
Are you completely sober?

00:49:53.300 --> 00:50:06.750
Well, we certainly appreciate this sobering talk.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:17.750
We will now be interested to hear what Brother Kenneth Cook has to say on the topic, will you care for it?

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.750
We care for the things that are important to us, don't we?

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.750
And there are many of such things.

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.750
For example, we care for our families.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.750
We care for our friends.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:31.750
We care for our ministry.

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:35.750
And above all, we care for our worship of Jehovah.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:39.750
And we do this faithfully to the very end.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:43.750
When others need us, we're there for them, as we've seen today.

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:52.750
During times of natural disasters, civil unrest and severe opposition to our work, we are there for one another.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:51:03.750
In addition to all of that, our love must also, though, be great enough to care for those whom we try to reach in our public ministry.

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:08.750
In this, Jesus set the example for us.

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:10.750
We can feel His caring attitude.

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:16.750
And what He said in Matthew, chapter 9, and verses 36 to 38.

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:22.750
So please follow along at Matthew, chapter 9, and verse 36.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:32.750
It says on seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:40.750
Then he said to his disciples, yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:46.750
Therefore, beg the master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:50.750
Jesus felt pity for the people, didn't he?

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:53.750
What does pity mean in this case?

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:58.750
The pity mentioned here stems from heart-felt love.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.750
He loved the people. We loved people.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:08.750
It's a tender feeling toward persons in a state of need or suffering.

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:17.750
Like Jesus, our love for others must include genuine care for them, even pity for them, so that we're moved to help them.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:24.750
See, hoping that they respond to God's word and will desire to do Jehovah's will.

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:32.750
And we must do this because caring for others is an important part of following the Christ, right?

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:43.750
In a few minutes, we will look at how we can remain focused on compassionately carrying out our ministry and helping people to dedicate their lives to God.

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:52.750
And this will include revealing what our year text is for 2020, so as Brother Lett said earlier, stay tuned.

00:52:52.750 --> 00:53:06.750
Before we get to that, though, we'll draw out some Bible principles from long ago that will help us today in caring for the people that we must yet reach in this important ministry or work.

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:13.750
Since ancient times, Jehovah has taught his people how to care for others.

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:20.750
In fact, the Israelites were told to show consideration even for the animals under their care.

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:29.750
For instance, when they were about to leave Egypt, Jehovah gave them this command at Exodus chapter 12, verses 5 and 6.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:31.750
Please follow along.

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:35.750
Now, here is the setting.

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:40.750
Jehovah gives instructions about selecting the Passover sacrifice.

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:51.750
Verse 3 tells us that the Israelites were to select the sheep on the 10th of the month, with this in mind, notice what verse 5 states,

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.750
Your sheep should be a sound one-year-old male.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:59.750
You may choose from the young rams or from the goats.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:11.750
You must care for it until the 14th day of this month, and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel must slaughter it at twilight.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:20.750
Why was it important for them to not only select the sheep but to care for it until the 14th?

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:28.750
To answer that question, let's draw out two principles that we will then apply to our ministry, and they do apply.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:38.750
First, we know that the sacrificial sheep needed to remain unblemished to be acceptable to Jehovah.

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:44.750
Verse 5 said, Your sheep should be a sound one-year-old male.

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:56.750
If an Israelite selected a sound sheep but then neglected it and the sheep was injured in some way, that sheep would no longer be acceptable to Jehovah for sacrifice.

00:54:56.750 --> 00:55:02.750
The principle, keep the sacrifice acceptable.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:11.750
Don't neglect it just because the end is close, and we can apply that principle to our ministry.

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:21.750
Now, principle number two, we can also be certain that a measure of compassion was involved in what Jehovah told them there.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:31.750
In this case, the sacrificial sheep was no less important just because its time, so to speak, was short.

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:40.750
As we'll see in this discussion, this too can apply to our ministry, and we're wise to remember these principles.

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:51.750
Fittingly, it is Jehovah who sets the example for us in showing compassion and caring for what is important to the very end.

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:58.750
Foremost in this is how Jehovah cared for Jesus right up to the end of his earthly ministry.

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:05.750
For instance, Jehovah showed his support for Jesus by answering Jesus prayers.

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:12.750
At one point, Jesus even said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:17.750
Also, Jehovah voiced his support for Jesus.

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.750
At his baptism, Jehovah, Jesus heard Jehovah speak from heaven stating,

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:28.750
this is my son, the beloved whom I have approved.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:31.750
Imagine how that encouraged him.

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:39.750
And then later, as Jesus was an agony during the hours before his death, an angel of God comforted Jesus.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:45.750
And no doubt that angel was a friend whom Jesus knew well.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:54.750
Yes, from the beginning to the very end, Jehovah cared for Jesus the sacrificial Lamb of God.

00:56:54.750 --> 00:57:02.750
We benefit when we apply such principles to what we have been given to do today.

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:06.750
For instance, the time is short, yes.

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:14.750
Yet our public ministry is no less important now just because the end is close.

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:21.750
In fact, it's even more important that we continue caring for this ministry as the end approaches.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:28.750
We must care for this sacrifice of praise to our Heavenly Father right up to the end.

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:36.750
That is right up to the time when Jehovah makes it clear that this part of our service to him has come to an end.

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:43.750
Until that time, what should be the focus of our public ministry?

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:49.750
Jesus stated what it should be at Matthew 28 and verses 18 through 20.

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.750
So please go to those verses.

00:57:53.750 --> 00:58:11.469
Now starting at Matthew 28 and in verse 18, Jesus said, there we go, Jesus approached and spoke to them saying,

00:58:11.469 --> 00:58:15.469
all authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.

00:58:15.469 --> 00:58:26.469
Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:31.469
teaching them to observe all the things I have to commanded you.

00:58:31.469 --> 00:58:39.469
And look, I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.

00:58:40.469 --> 00:58:47.469
So now with these words of Jesus in mind, what should be the focus of our public ministry?

00:58:47.469 --> 00:58:58.469
Well, the focus must be to make disciples of Christ among people of all the nations, teaching them and baptizing them as Jesus stated.

00:58:58.469 --> 00:59:03.469
Notice that Jesus' statement was more than just a command.

00:59:03.469 --> 00:59:08.469
Jesus started off saying, I command you go, right?

00:59:08.469 --> 00:59:13.469
Rather, Jesus said, all authority has been given me.

00:59:13.469 --> 00:59:15.469
Go therefore.

00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:24.469
Jesus' true disciples would see beyond the command embedded in those words and go forth with conviction.

00:59:24.469 --> 00:59:25.469
Why?

00:59:25.469 --> 00:59:35.469
Because they would know that Jesus was empowered, authorized to oversee this great work that they were now commissioned to do.

00:59:35.469 --> 00:59:42.469
He would be with them and he is with us today. We're absolutely confident of that fact.

00:59:42.469 --> 00:59:54.469
In view of that, how can we help our Bible students so that even more of them become baptized disciples as Jesus there directed?

00:59:54.469 --> 01:00:06.469
This is important to consider, because while many get baptized each year, our yearly baptism figures have remained at about the same level for some time.

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:11.469
Now, are these good figures? Yes, they are. Absolutely.

01:00:11.469 --> 01:00:19.469
But what can we do to help even more people take this vital step before the end comes?

01:00:19.469 --> 01:00:25.469
To answer that question, let's briefly consider four ways to reach the heart.

01:00:25.469 --> 01:00:29.469
There's much that we can do, but we'll just consider four ways here.

01:00:29.469 --> 01:00:43.469
We do it through what we emphasize about Jehovah, what we teach our students about prayer, how we help them get to meetings, and how we help them handle problems.

01:00:43.469 --> 01:00:51.469
Let's consider that first way. We reach the heart through what we emphasize about Jehovah.

01:00:51.469 --> 01:00:57.469
Our goal is to help our students see that Jehovah cares for them.

01:00:57.469 --> 01:01:00.469
He cares about them. He loves them deeply.

01:01:01.469 --> 01:01:14.469
As we use our publications, such as the Teach Us book with our students, we should prepare well and highlight the scriptural answers to questions such as, does God care about us?

01:01:14.469 --> 01:01:22.469
How does God feel when people suffer? And is it possible to be Jehovah's friend?

01:01:22.469 --> 01:01:35.469
Just the answers, draw out the meaning that brings us joy and identify the principles that improve our life and help the student to grow ever closer to Jehovah.

01:01:35.469 --> 01:01:37.469
Now, the second way.

01:01:37.469 --> 01:01:42.469
We reach the heart through what we teach our students about prayer.

01:01:42.469 --> 01:01:51.469
We show him or her how to pray properly with meaning and from the heart as we pray with them at each study session.

01:01:51.469 --> 01:02:01.469
Explain that in our private prayers, we can really open up to Jehovah and express feelings that we might not share with other humans.

01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:07.469
We can also ask for God's help to love only what He loves.

01:02:07.469 --> 01:02:17.469
Why can we do this with confidence? Because Jehovah cares for us and we should make that very clear as we teach our Bible students.

01:02:17.469 --> 01:02:19.469
Next, the third way.

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:25.469
We reach the heart through how we help our students get to meetings.

01:02:25.469 --> 01:02:29.469
Invite your Bible student to attend meetings as soon as possible.

01:02:29.469 --> 01:02:34.469
What a student sees in our meetings may touch his heart and help him to progress.

01:02:34.469 --> 01:02:40.469
Very early on, show the video what happens at a kingdom hall.

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:48.469
Then, warmly invite him to attend with you, appeal to him, also offer transportation if it is needed.

01:02:48.469 --> 01:02:54.469
I really appreciated getting a ride to the first meeting that I attended and I still remember it.

01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:57.469
Finally, the fourth way.

01:02:57.469 --> 01:03:07.469
We reach the heart through how we help our students handle problems, including problems that may develop if someone offends him or her.

01:03:07.469 --> 01:03:12.469
This is all part of reaching the heart and preparing and helping them.

01:03:12.469 --> 01:03:19.469
Our Bible students need to experience Jehovah's love as they benefit from applying Bible principles.

01:03:19.469 --> 01:03:22.469
See, this helps them to know Jehovah better.

01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:35.469
To help them show your students how to use tools such as the JW Library app, the Research Guide for Jehovah's Witnesses and JW.org.

01:03:35.469 --> 01:03:46.469
When our students are trained to search for answers before baptism, they will be better prepared to handle problems and get along with others.

01:03:46.469 --> 01:03:56.469
When we do these things for our Bible students, we show that we are really caring for what Jehovah has entrusted to us.

01:03:56.469 --> 01:04:08.469
Both Jehovah and his son desire that we help as many people to the point of dedication and baptism while there is still time.

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:14.469
To succeed, don't spend time conducting an unproductive study.

01:04:14.469 --> 01:04:25.469
Rather, focus on those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life and care for them with Jehovah's blessing on your efforts.

01:04:25.469 --> 01:04:31.469
So then, with all of this in mind, what is our year text for 2020?

01:04:31.469 --> 01:04:46.969
It is taken from Matthew 28, 19, go therefore, and make disciples aptizing them.

01:04:46.969 --> 01:04:56.969
Now, for those of you who listened to Alexa earlier in the program or read your daily text for today, you know that this is also the scripture text for today.

01:04:56.969 --> 01:05:07.329
October 5, 2019. That's just a coincidence. Don't expect it next year.

01:05:07.329 --> 01:05:17.329
Now, with that text in mind, keep putting your heart into your ministry and into helping people and be certain to take care of this ministry.

01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:22.329
With those principles, we considered to the very end.

01:05:22.329 --> 01:05:33.019
Thank you very much, Brother Cook, for your presentation.

01:05:33.019 --> 01:05:48.300
Looking back on the program that we were able to enjoy, we certainly felt encouraged by being reminded that we have no human leader but that it is Jesus who is our leader.

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:52.300
Remember what it says in Matthew 23, 10.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:58.300
Neither be called leaders, for your leader is one, the Christ.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:08.300
We enjoyed also listening to Brother Stephen Let, who emphasized that our relief ministry is overseen and directed by Jehovah.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.300
I'm sure you also enjoyed the four videos.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:20.300
The first one was entitled The Good Hand of our God is upon us. Let us get up and build.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:32.300
The next video provided a historical look at property acquisitions followed by another video related to the new construction project that is being planned.

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:46.300
The fourth video was about the new application for processing applications, followed by a presentation on a new way to access JW.org audio files.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:56.300
After that, we enjoyed the scriptural discussion and attack coming from the north presented by Brother David's plane from the governing body.

01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:07.300
Brother Samuel Hurd next encouraged us to study the Bible with a study Bible and how we appreciate the study Bible.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:18.300
After singing a song together and listening to greetings from brothers in other places and countries, Brother Anthony Morris reminded us that we have worked it out.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:30.300
As indicated in the news media, there are increasing problems in the world. In certain areas, we can also see increasing hostility against God's people.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:40.300
Brother Mark Sanderson of the governing body showed that we do not have to be fearful because the Almighty is on our side.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:53.860
Next we heard the talk by Brother Jeffrey Jackson. Are you completely sober? We are if we keep our senses.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:08:01.860
And finally, Brother Kenneth Cook from the governing body raised the question, will you care for it?

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:09.860
Brother Cook reviewed how Jehovah cared for Jesus, the sacrificial Lamb of God, until the very end of his life on earth.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:25.859
Likewise, in harmony with the 2020 year text that's taken from Matthew 28.19, he highlighted how we must care for our ministry and our sacrifice of praise until the very end.

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:35.859
This includes our efforts to help those who are rightly disposed to dedicate their life to Jehovah and to get baptized.

01:08:35.859 --> 01:09:00.470
Well, we have had an encouraging time together, haven't we? Well, we enjoyed the various videos also, the video presentations, and we all benefited from the scriptural talks delivered by members of the governing body.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:11.470
And then we also appreciate the discussion on the year text for the coming year. Go there and make disciples, baptizing them.
