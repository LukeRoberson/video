WEBVTT

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:08.230
Always allowed Jehovah to direct your steps as a theme brother Jeffrey Jackson a member of the governing body

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.470
We'll now share with us

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.910
Well, it's a real privilege and pleasure for me to stand before you again

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.570
It just seems like a few days ago when I had the privilege of giving you the first lecture

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.309
That I give you a gillian and now here it is you're very special day of graduation

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.310
Before you go on to your assignments after graduation

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.310
We'd like to leave you with a question

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.310
Are you willing to allow Jehovah to direct your steps?

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.310
Now we all know how you're going to answer

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.310
Because we know that you've been willing to allow Jehovah to direct your steps right up to this moment

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
That's why you dedicated yourselves to Jehovah

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:02.310
Why you ended full-time service, special full-time service, and that's why you're here having attended gillian

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:10.310
And that's why we love you and we're proud of you because you are willing to allow Jehovah to direct your steps

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:23.310
But you know, perhaps it seems a little presumptuous on our part to ask the question about are we willing to allow Jehovah to do anything?

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.310
Well the reason behind that question is of course that Jehovah doesn't force himself on us

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.310
It doesn't automatically happen that Jehovah directs our steps

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.310
In fact, something is required of us and this in a sense allows Jehovah to work with us

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.310
Let's have a look in our Bibles at an interesting scripture in the book of Psalms

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.310
It's Psalm 37, a section of scripture that we all use over and over again in the service

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.310
But this time we're going to look at verse 23, Psalm 37 verse 23

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.310
Jehovah guides the steps of a man when he finds pleasure in his way

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.310
Now if you were just listening to that and you didn't have a printed or electronic copy in front of you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.310
It would be easy to misunderstand this verse

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.310
Why?

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:30.310
Well if you hear it read, when he finds pleasure in his way, you naturally assume when the man finds pleasure in Jehovah's way

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.310
But you notice a new world translation capitalizes the he

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.310
When he finds pleasure in his way

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.310
So now if we were to substitute the pronouns there, what does it really say?

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.310
Jehovah guides the steps of a man when Jehovah finds pleasure in the man's way

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.310
Isn't that an interesting concept?

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.310
So for us to have our steps guided by Jehovah

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.310
We have to do things that bring pleasure to Jehovah and when Jehovah finds pleasure in our way

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.310
Then he directs our steps

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.310
Isn't that a profound thought?

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.310
So in that way once we do things in accordance with Jehovah's will

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.310
It's as if we figuratively allowed Jehovah to direct our steps

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.310
Now that doesn't come automatically just because we pray to Jehovah, please direct my steps

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.310
Let's think of two examples from the Scriptures

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.310
Two negative examples that help us in this regard

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.310
First of all, let's think about Balam

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.310
Now remember this is in the 15th century BCE

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.310
When the Israelites were about to go into the Promised Land

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.310
The Moabites were very worried about it

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.310
Balam was a man who had some connection to the worship of Jehovah

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.310
And now all of a sudden these messengers come to Balam

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.310
And they ask him to curse God's people

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.310
And do you remember what happened? What did Balam do?

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.310
He didn't automatically answer, did he?

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.310
He said, wait here overnight I want to hear from Jehovah

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.310
And what did Jehovah say to him?

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.310
Basically, don't go

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.310
Now that's not hard to understand isn't it?

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.310
Don't go, it's simple, you don't need a lawyer to try and work out what that means

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.310
But then what happened? Well the pressure intensified, didn't it?

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.310
And more messengers came, this time princes and more offers of material gain

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.310
Now what did Balam do? Well he had clearly heard Jehovah's direction, don't go

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.310
But what did he do? Well you see his heart was already leaning in a certain direction

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.310
So he was hoping this would change a little

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.310
So he said, well let's just wait and see what Jehovah says

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.310
Now this time what did Jehovah say?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.310
Go but don't say anything I don't tell you to say

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.310
In other words, I'll only say what I tell you

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.310
Now was this because Jehovah was directing Balam's step?

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.310
Or was it because he allowed Balam to go his own way?

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.310
Well we see what happened three times, resistance

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.310
But then what happened? Well notice if we turn across to numbers 22

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.310
We hear a very clear statement, in fact Nellie is clear as the statement, don't go

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.310
Numbers 22, 32

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.310
Then Jehovah's angel said to him, why have you beaten your donkey these three times?

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:58.310
Look, I myself came out to offer resistance because your way is in defiance of my will

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.310
So then we see the answer, don't we? It wasn't Jehovah directing his steps

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.310
Jehovah was resisting what he was doing

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.310
So what do we learn from this?

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.310
Well even though Balam initially wanted to get Jehovah's direction

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.310
Jehovah didn't force himself on Balam

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.310
And when Balam was determined to go down a certain course

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.310
Yes, Jehovah gave him signals of don't go again, don't go

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.310
But Jehovah allowed him to go and of course eventually he ended up dying because of that

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.310
And of course many others died because of that as well

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:41.310
So what's the lesson for us? Well sometimes we may feel that at a certain point in our life

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.310
We say Jehovah, what do you want me to do? What's your will?

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.310
And that's good that we pray that Jehovah that way

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.310
But what do we need to do? We need to do what Jehovah wants us to do

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.310
Then when he finds pleasure in what we're doing, he directs our step

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.310
So that's a good lesson isn't it?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.310
The second example we want to use is of the unnamed prophet

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.310
Do you remember the one that's mentioned in 1 Kings chapter 13

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:19.310
Who was instructed to go up to Israel and to utter a pronouncement there to King Jehovah

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.310
Now remember the instructions, again Jehovah gave him

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.310
Go up one way, come back the other way

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.310
Don't eat or drink

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.310
Even when the king said come and eat and drink what is on him

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.310
I know what you have wants me to do

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.310
But then what happened?

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.310
Although he was doing very well up to that point

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:45.310
Remember the old prophet tricked him by saying, oh don't worry

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.310
An angel spoke to me and said it's okay

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.310
What did the unnamed prophet say?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.310
Let me check with Jehovah again, I mean he did actually tell me

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.310
Okay, let's see

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.310
Well, again it resulted in disaster didn't it?

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.310
What's the lesson we learned there?

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:10.310
Well, although he'd started a course that was allowing Jehovah to direct his steps

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:15.310
He didn't continue to follow the direction that Jehovah had given him

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.310
Now that's a good lesson for us too isn't it?

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.310
We may do the same

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.310
There could be friends, could even be people we respect

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:28.310
They give us advice contrary to what Jehovah is telling us

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.309
And that could also lead to disaster

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:36.309
What would have helped in both those situations?

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.309
Well, I'd like to read you a quote from the watch tab

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:44.309
Back in 1950 before any of you were ever born

00:08:44.309 --> 00:08:48.309
And incidentally before I was born too

00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:50.309
But I'm sure brother heard read it

00:08:50.309 --> 00:09:00.350
Anyway, the quote says

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:07.350
It is far better to take a few moments for quiet reflection

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:13.350
Fully considering God's requirements before rushing into an action

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.350
That might bring God's reproof

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.350
Let me read it again

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.350
It is far better to take a few moments for quiet reflection

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:30.350
Fully considering God's requirements before rushing into an action that might bring God's reproof

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.350
So how could we summarize that in a nice little expression?

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.350
Well, we could say don't rush in

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:46.350
Pause, ponder, pray, and prove

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.350
Prove to yourself what Jehovah really wants you to do

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.350
So with that in mind as you go to your assignments

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.350
You're going to find all sorts of challenges

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.350
But how can you apply this principle of

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.350
Don't rush in

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.350
Pause, ponder, pray, and prove to yourself what Jehovah wants

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.350
Well, let's consider three different circumstances

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:17.350
So we always want to allow Jehovah to direct our steps

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.350
When we're excited about something

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.350
Excited we want to get in and do something

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.350
Now let's take for example Jacob

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.350
We all remember he describes this in the scriptures

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.350
How he felt when he was told that his son Joseph supposedly had died

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.350
He was grief-stricken

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:46.350
And for years he was left with that impression that his son was dead

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:52.350
Now can you imagine, just try to imagine the joy that he would have felt

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.350
When all of a sudden his son's returned back from Egypt

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.350
There's wagons, I mean not just your average wagons

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.350
I'm sure they were pretty fancy wagons

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.350
They're coming to pick him up, he finds out Joseph is alive

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.350
Not only that, he's in Egypt, he's got a very high position there

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.350
How do you think, do you think excited is the word?

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.350
Of course, he was extremely excited and overjoyed

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.350
So he left Hebron, went down to Beashiva

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:28.350
But what did he do before he left the Promised Land to go into Egypt?

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.350
Well, let's have a look at Genesis chapter 46

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:38.350
Genesis chapter 46 and we'll read verse 1 through 4

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.350
So Israel or Jacob took all that he had and departed

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.350
When he arrived at Beashiva, he offered sacrifices to God

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:52.350
You see, he stopped, he paused, he pondered

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:58.350
Yes, verse 2, then God spoke to Israel in a vision by night and said

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.350
Jacob, Jacob to which he said, here I am

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:07.350
He said, I am the true God, the God of your Father

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.350
Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.350
For there I will make you into a great nation

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:20.350
I myself will go down with you to Egypt and I myself will also bring you back from there

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.350
And Joseph will lay his hand on your eyes

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.350
Do you see what happened?

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.350
You see, he stopped, he paused, he pondered

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.350
He wanted to prove to himself what Jehovah wanted

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.350
And Jehovah gave him the go ahead, he had Jehovah's blessing

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.350
And we know how that turned out

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.350
So do we see the lesson for us?

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.350
Perhaps at times we get all excited about something

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.350
It appears good, it appears that we should do it

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.350
What should we do?

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:54.350
Pause, ponder, pray, improve to yourself

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.350
That that's really what Jehovah wants you to do

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.350
Now let's think of a second example

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.350
Imagine the time when the Israelites were entering the Promised Land

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.350
Or about to conquer the land

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.350
How exciting it must have been to them

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:17.350
They were busy with an assignment that Jehovah had given them

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.350
But still, even if we are in the middle of an assignment

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:27.350
We have to pause, ponder, pray, improve to ourselves

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.350
What Jehovah wants us to do

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.350
For example, in Joshua chapter 8

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.350
When we look there, you'll notice we won't read it

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:38.350
But they were able to capture Jericho

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.350
Then AI, there was a problem, wasn't it?

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.350
They had to sort that out

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:46.350
They went back, they were able to defeat the inhabitants of AI

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.350
What did they do next?

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.350
You see, here they are, poised to conquer the whole Promised Land

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.350
They went up to Mount Ebo, not Mount Ebo

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.350
Just so we got that right

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.350
They went up to Mount Ebo

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.350
And what did they do?

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:10.350
They paused, pondered, prayed, and proved to themselves what Jehovah wanted them to do

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.350
They read the whole law

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.350
Yes, they stopped the military campaign

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:20.350
Took time to make sure what Jehovah wanted them to do

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.350
And then they went ahead to complete that military campaign

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.350
So again, what lesson for us?

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.350
You've received many assignments, you will receive more assignments in the future

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.350
But just because you're in the middle of an assignment, you've started

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:40.350
Doesn't mean to say that you'll continue to allow Jehovah to direct your steps

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:48.350
You have to pause, ponder, pray, and prove to yourself what Jehovah wants

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.350
Now the third situation as a reminder

00:14:52.350 --> 00:15:00.350
We still need to be extra careful to allow Jehovah to direct our steps when we have special privileges

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:06.350
You see, it's very easy for us to think, well, now I've been to Gilead

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:11.350
I can probably miss a few meetings for a few months anyway

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.350
I've got a bit of spiritual fat

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.350
You see, all those other brothers, they need to go to the meetings

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:24.350
But I've got plenty to keep me going for a while

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.350
Really?

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.350
Well, we have an example in the scriptures to help us in that regard

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.350
Let's look at Luke chapter 2

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.350
And this, of course, is the account dealing with Joseph and Mary

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.350
Enter Jesus' birth

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.350
So Luke chapter 2 verses 22 through 24

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:52.019
There it says, also when the time came for purifying them according to the Lord of Moses

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:56.019
They brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to Jehovah

00:15:56.019 --> 00:16:04.019
Just as it is written in Jehovah's law, every firstborn male must be called holy to Jehovah

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:13.019
And they offer the sacrifice according to what is said in the Lord of Jehovah, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons

00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:15.019
So what happened here? When?

00:16:15.019 --> 00:16:25.019
Well, remember this was 40 days after Jesus' birth, Mary needed to go to the temple to purify herself according to the law

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:32.019
And we notice verse 22 and 24 refers to that, the law says to do that

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:35.019
But verse 23, what's that referring to?

00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:39.019
You see, if you look at the marginal reference where this is taken from

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:43.019
It's not talking about the purification of Mary

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:45.019
What is it talking about?

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:54.019
Well, possibly it's talking about where the man, the husband, would have to present the child to Jehovah and pay the five shekels

00:16:54.019 --> 00:16:57.019
And acknowledge that this child was his

00:16:57.019 --> 00:17:06.019
So if that's the case, that means both Joseph and Mary took the time to go and make these presentations

00:17:06.019 --> 00:17:14.019
Joseph was supposed to do that after 30 days after Jesus' birth or sometime thereafter

00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:17.019
But whatever the case, what do we learn from this?

00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:23.019
See, Joseph and Mary didn't say, well, you know, we had an angel come to visit us

00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:27.019
And this child is very, very, very special

00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:34.019
And remember when he was born, the shepherds came, the heavens were filled with angels

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:40.019
Surely we shouldn't have to go and pay the five shekels and offer up the birds

00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:42.019
They didn't do that, did they?

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:51.019
They didn't use the special privilege they had as an excuse not to do what Jehovah had instructed them to do

00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:53.019
Do we see the lesson for us?

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:56.019
You see, if that was the case with them, what about us?

00:17:56.019 --> 00:18:02.019
It doesn't matter what privileges we have, we still have to do the basic things

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:07.019
We can't use our privileges as an excuse not to do those things

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:16.019
Things such as daily Bible reading, prayer, meeting attendance, the witnessing work, and so on

00:18:16.019 --> 00:18:26.019
So yes, we need to make sure that we don't allow those things to, as it were, give us an excuse to not do what Jehovah wants us to do

00:18:26.019 --> 00:18:36.019
Well, when we think about it, how could we summarize what we personally need to do to make sure that we allowed Jehovah to direct our step?

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:40.019
Well, the last scripture I'd like to share with you is in the book of Proverbs

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:46.019
Proverbs chapter 23 and verse 19

00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:50.019
Proverbs 23 verse 19

00:18:51.019 --> 00:18:58.019
Listen by Son and become wise and direct your heart in the right way

00:18:58.019 --> 00:19:00.019
So what do we need to do?

00:19:00.019 --> 00:19:07.019
We need to direct our heart in the right way and when we go in the right way, what happens?

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:12.019
Jehovah then favors us, he's happy with us and then what does he do?

00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:15.019
He directs our steps

00:19:15.019 --> 00:19:21.019
So it's all very exciting, you're going to your assignments soon, we wish you Jehovah's rich blessing

00:19:21.019 --> 00:19:24.019
And we know that you will succeed with Jehovah's help

00:19:24.019 --> 00:19:29.019
But also remember, it doesn't matter what situation you face

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:36.019
You're excited about something, you're right in the middle of an assignment, or perhaps you have special privileges

00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:38.019
What do you need to do?

00:19:38.019 --> 00:19:43.019
Pause, ponder, pray and prove to yourself what Jehovah wants

00:19:43.019 --> 00:19:49.019
If you do that, we know you will always allow Jehovah to guide your steps

00:19:49.019 --> 00:19:59.160
Now we'll have our presentation of diplomas

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:09.059

But he's going to read the class letter to us.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:35.160
September 9, 2017.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:41.079
Do the governing body and the Beth of family, dear brothers.

00:26:41.079 --> 00:26:48.279
At Psalm 25, verse 12 and 13, David wrote,

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:53.519
Who is the man fearing Jehovah?

00:26:53.519 --> 00:26:59.480
He will instruct him about the way he should choose.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:05.140
He will experience what is good.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:11.380
The instructions we have received at Jehovah's Hand over the past five months

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.299
as far as surpassed our expectation.

00:27:15.299 --> 00:27:22.019
Indeed, our hearts have been filled with so many good things.

00:27:22.019 --> 00:27:30.420
When we started our training, Bible verses were like many isolated dots on a canvas.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.619
We have been taught how to connect them,

00:27:35.619 --> 00:27:39.059
reveal in a marvelous picture.

00:27:39.059 --> 00:27:44.579
Moreover, we have learned how to work with Jehovah even more closely.

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:52.019
We have also been taught how to display the mind of Christ more fully,

00:27:52.019 --> 00:28:00.099
especially by imitating His love when dealing with our brothers and sisters.

00:28:00.099 --> 00:28:03.940
Like Paul, we ask.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.099
Well, then, are we to say about these things?

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:13.460
We have mixed feelings, deep gratitude,

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.700
and a sense of insignificance of awareness.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.859
Gratitude to you, members of the governing body,

00:28:21.859 --> 00:28:24.660
for your loving and honest counsel,

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.980
gratitude to you, our dear instructors,

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.859
for your tireless efforts to reach and touch our hearts,

00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:36.660
and gratitude to you,

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.980
the members of the Bethlehem family.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:44.339
We will never forget your warm welcome

00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:50.180
and the way you included us in your family.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:56.500
On the other hand, we're feeling significant in view of the greatness of Jehovah's organization,

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:02.500
and significant as we begin to understand the depth of God's Word,

00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:08.259
insignificant in view of the immense task ahead of us

00:29:08.259 --> 00:29:13.940
as we strive to apply all that we have learned.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.420
Furthermore, stay in our patricin for 20 weeks,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:24.339
allowed us to feel the pose of the earthly part of Jehovah's organization.

00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:29.619
We have enjoyed the willing spirit of the many young ones,

00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:33.059
and the wonderful example of faithful service

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:36.099
of our older brothers and sisters.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.339
We're working with you.

00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:43.299
We realized how much is accomplished behind the scenes,

00:29:44.259 --> 00:29:49.059
and we were deeply touched when we personally saw how the governing body

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:54.980
genuinely cares for our dear brothers and sisters all over the world,

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.500
and especially now in Russia.

00:30:00.579 --> 00:30:06.980
However, these are more than just mere memories.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.299
It is a turning point in our lives.

00:30:11.299 --> 00:30:16.180
We understand that the biggest test is still ahead of us.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:25.059
Whatever Simon comes our way, we are determined to do our very best

00:30:25.059 --> 00:30:29.299
for Jehovah's glory and the benefit of his organization.

00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:39.140
Yes, it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one reach.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.740
We have been enriched by making new lifelong friends,

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.019
and by the wonderful heritage received at Gillette.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:31:00.740
It is now our wish and pleasure to share these blessings with others in our assignments.

00:31:02.259 --> 00:31:08.900
Your brothers and sisters, the 143th class of Giliate.

00:31:09.539 --> 00:31:41.640
It was definitely brought home to us today that Jehovah is our grand instructor.

00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:45.400
There's none like him in the entire universe.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.480
He's so patient with us and so kind and so merciful,

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.720
and the definitely so loving.

00:31:52.519 --> 00:31:59.960
He's been good to us today, and he's going to be good for us forever.

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:02.359
So we're just getting started.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:10.359
We're crawling, but one of these days we'll get up and we'll walk and we'll run.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:17.880
Jehovah ranks the highest. He was teaching not just you, but all of us today.

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:24.759
None of us as sinful humans could say our speak the words that touched our hearts

00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:27.720
without the help of Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:34.039
And there's not a brother to that, does not ask for that spirit, our sister,

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:43.880
who steps out here before God's sheep, and gives any kind of encouragement or instruction.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.559
Jesus gave us the promise of John 1926.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:59.930
And this is what he said, those of you who have your pads, you're already there.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.930
I'm just getting there. That's the 1426, John.

00:33:06.569 --> 00:33:11.690
He says, but to help her, the Holy Spirit, which the Father will send in my name,

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:20.089
that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds, all the things I told you.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:25.049
So the Holy Spirit is going to help you remember,

00:33:25.049 --> 00:33:33.900
without it you couldn't remember, but we pray for the Holy Spirit,

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.740
and it's sent to us, and we remember.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.539
Sometimes we're shocked at how much we can remember at a given time.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.099
Well, it's not us, somebody's helping us to remember.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.579
And we must never forget that.

00:33:51.099 --> 00:33:55.180
That promised that Jesus gave way back then,

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:02.460
held true, not only for Jesus' disciples, back then, who loved him very much,

00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:08.619
but it holds true today for those who love him as we do.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:15.019
And we definitely love him. There's just no doubt in our minds about him.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:21.820
The love that we have in our hearts for Jehovah God and Jesus is there.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.889
Jehovah opens our minds and hearts to receive His Word.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:34.730
Just think of the things that we've heard from this platform today.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:37.690
Things that touched the heart,

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.809
warmed the soul.

00:34:42.329 --> 00:34:45.289
Jehovah was with us today, and by the means of His Holy Spirit.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.400
Of course, this happened years ago to a worshiper of Jehovah.

00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:54.119
It wasn't a male, it was a female.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:00.650
In Acts chapter 16, verse 14, we find His Lydia.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.420
It reads, and a certain woman named Lydia,

00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:08.460
a cellar purple of the city of Thyatira,

00:35:09.179 --> 00:35:15.980
and a worshiper of God was listening, and Jehovah opened her heart wide

00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:20.940
to pay attention to the things being spoken by Paul.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.099
When Jehovah speaks and he opens our hearts,

00:35:25.099 --> 00:35:31.579
we must not close our hearts by failing to pay attention to the brother that is Jehovah

00:35:31.579 --> 00:35:33.420
is using to speak through.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.019
If we're not careful, we just may close to that brother

00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:42.380
because his tie is not straight.

00:35:44.219 --> 00:35:50.500
His shoes are not shined, that's dangerous.

00:35:51.539 --> 00:35:54.340
We want to listen to him, Jehovah put him up there,

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.619
and we want to listen to what he has to say.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.460
Don't be so concerned with the way he looks.

00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:07.300
If someone was concerned with the way a donkey looked, he wouldn't have paid any attention

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.739
years ago because Jehovah spoke to the donkey.

00:36:12.739 --> 00:36:21.449
Donkeys are not most beautiful animal, but Jehovah chooses what Jehovah wants to choose,

00:36:22.409 --> 00:36:26.409
and he teaches lessons for each and every one of us.

00:36:27.849 --> 00:36:30.570
Now, of course, when Lydia was opening her heart,

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:37.769
like Jehovah's hell, she's looking at Paul, but Paul may not have been the most handsome man to

00:36:37.769 --> 00:36:44.039
look at. We don't really know. Some say that his eyebrows matched.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.860
Others say he couldn't see good. Some say he was bald-headed.

00:36:53.539 --> 00:37:04.039
We don't really know. One of these days, we'll know. Well, you're no longer Gilead students.

00:37:04.599 --> 00:37:16.489
You're ex-Gilead students, but may you never become ex-students of Jehovah, your grand instructor.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:23.369
They didn't give me too many minutes, you know, to talk to you. That's all the time I've got.

00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:34.019
Isn't this a beautiful group, though?
