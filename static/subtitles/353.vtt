00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.519
Now, when you think of it, the Apostle Paul was a very humble man.

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.720
He was flexible.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.199
He says, to the Jew, I became as a Jew.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.160
And to those under law, I became as under law.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.640
But there were limits to Paul's flexibility, and we're going to talk about that in just

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.920
a few moments.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.719
First of all, though, when Paul came down to Jerusalem, the elders explained that thousands

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:36.200
of Jews had become believers, and they were all zealous for the law.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.880
Now, they had heard a rumor about Paul.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.960
They had heard the rumor that Paul was telling the Jews not to circumcise their children,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.240
and the elders were worried about it.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.039
They had a plan.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.200
We read about that plan in Acts chapter 21, if you would like to turn there, Acts chapter

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:07.780
21, verses 23 and 24, here's their plan.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.459
So do what we tell you.

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:15.939
We have four men who have put themselves under a vow.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.019
Take these men with you, and cleanse yourself ceremonially together with them, and take

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:27.060
care of their expenses, so that they may have their heads shaved.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.420
And everyone will know that there is nothing to the rumors they were told about you, but

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:42.359
that you are walking orderly, and you are also keeping the law.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:48.159
Now it says, they have heard a rumor about you that you were telling Jews not to circumcise

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.159
their children.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.640
Paul was probably not telling Jews not to circumcise their children.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.640
Paul has already been mentioned, Paul took Timothy and circumcised him so as not to stumble

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.959
the Jews.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.560
Paul realized that there was nothing wrong with circumcision per se.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.520
It was when people proclaimed that circumcision was necessary in order to gain salvation,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.080
that the problem arose.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.280
So this was a rumor, but some brothers and sisters were willing to believe a rumor about a faithful

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.639
brother rather than to trust Paul.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.840
Just as today some believe everything they read in the newspaper and they don't even ask

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.360
any questions.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.319
So now here's the question.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.159
What were they going to do about it?

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.000
The elders had a suggestion.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.800
They said, we have four men who have put themselves under a vow, and they wanted Paul to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.120
take these men to the temple and pay their expenses.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.120
Paul agreed.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.840
Now that took humility.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.960
We all know how strongly Paul felt about keeping the law.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.960
And yet Paul was willing to see the bigger picture.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.680
He had strong feelings, but at the same time these Jews were probably new in the truth,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.960
and Paul wanted to go as far as he could go so as not to stumble those new in the truth.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.280
Now the vow.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.759
What was the vow?

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:25.400
First scholars agreed that the vow was a probably a Nazarite vow.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.919
And if it was, that was going to be tricky for Paul.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.159
Because you see in Nazarites we're required to offer a sin offering when their vow came

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.159
to a completion.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.159
Now Paul would never have agreed to that.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.639
It would have shown disrespect for the sacrifice of Christ.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.840
So Paul and those four men were going to have to be very careful about how far they would

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.960
go in the completion of this vow.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.159
And we can be sure that they would never do anything that would go against their conscience.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:04.120
Now we can see that on this occasion Paul went a long way so as not to stumble the Jews.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.159
But on another occasion he refused to cater to the Jews.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.560
We read about that at Galatians chapter 2.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.639
Let's turn there.

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.800
Galatians chapter 2.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.699
And we'll read verses 11 to 14.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.139
Galatians 2, 11 to 14.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:36.620
However, when Seifas came to Antioch, I resisted him face to face because he was clearly

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.660
in the wrong.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.980
For before certain men from James arrived, he used to eat with people of the nations.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.259
But when they arrived he stopped doing this and separated himself, fearing those of the

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.740
circumcised class.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.860
The rest of the Jews also joined him in putting on this pretence so that even Barnabas was

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.540
that along with them and their pretence.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.300
But when I saw that they were not walking in step with the truth of the good news, I said

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.139
to Seifas before them all, if you, though you were a Jew, live as the nations do and not

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:17.019
as Jews do, how can you compel people of the nations to live according to Jewish practice?

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:20.180
So we see what was happening here.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.540
Up till the time when men from James came down to Antioch, Peter and Arnebus and the other

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.620
Jewish Christians were happily eating with the Gentiles.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.980
But now a man from James came down and suddenly Peter starts to separate himself from the Gentiles

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.100
and following his lead, other Jewish Christians began doing the same thing.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.660
Now who was probably new in the truth?

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.019
In this case it was probably the Gentile Christians.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:58.740
In Acts 21 it was probably the Jews who were newer in the truth and Paul didn't want

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.339
to stumble the Jews, but at this point Paul could not be all things to all people.

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:09.660
He couldn't please the Jews, he couldn't please the men from James and also please the

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.500
Gentiles.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.819
He was either going to have to stumble, if you will, the men from James or he was going

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.980
to have to stumble the Gentiles.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.139
He had to make a choice and so Paul made his choice.

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.259
And what did he do about it?

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:31.699
He followed the advice that he recorded in this same book of Galatians.

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.060
Can you think of what that was?

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.060
Galatians chapter 6.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.980
Was it saying, if a man takes a false step before he is aware of it?

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.740
What did Paul say about Peter?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.660
He was not walking in step with the good news so Peter was taking a false step.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:59.540
You who have spiritual qualifications, that would be Paul, try to readjust such a man

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.540
in his spirit of mildness.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.180
And that's what the Apostle Paul did.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.980
Now we love to pick on Peter.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.819
But let's give the poor man a break.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.019
Let's give him credit for what he was doing right.

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:16.620
This was Antioch.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.540
Now what do we know about Antioch?

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:26.259
It was in Antioch when the whole matter of keeping the law blew up in the first place.

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:29.660
And who was it who were stirring things up in Antioch?

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.740
It was men from Jerusalem, men from James.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.100
Now up until this point, Peter and Barnabas and the others, they're happily eating with

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:46.019
the Gentiles until men from Jerusalem come down and start stirring up trouble.

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:50.019
You kind of think that if they'd stayed home once in a while, there would have been

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:53.259
a lot less trouble in the Christian congregation.

00:07:53.259 --> 00:08:00.860
So Peter was doing the right thing up until the men from James came down.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:07.660
Now Peter knew how critical men from James could be or men from Jerusalem could be.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.980
He might say he'd seen that movie before in 36 CE.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:19.620
Just after the conversion of Cornelius, notice a detail in Acts chapter 11, verses 2 and

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.339
3.

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:29.819
And this might help us at least understand Peter's concern and perhaps a misguided effort,

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:32.340
not to stumble the men from James.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.860
Acts chapter 11 verses 2 and 3.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.740
So when Peter came up to Jerusalem, this is in 33 CE.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.059
The supporters of circumcision began to criticize him, saying, you went into the house of men

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:52.860
who were not circumcised and ate with them.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:59.299
Well Peter knew how sensitive Jews were about eating with the Gentiles, but he was moved

00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:06.139
by the fear of man and the Apostle Paul did right to approve him.

00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:09.500
Because after all, he was going to have to make a choice.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.659
You stumble the Jews or you stumble the Gentiles.

00:09:13.659 --> 00:09:14.659
The lesson?

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:16.659
The take away?

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:19.899
There are times when you can't please everyone.

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:24.539
There are times when you cannot be all things to all people.

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:27.539
Our young people have to realize that.

00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:33.299
You have to take a stand for what is right and let the ships fall where they may.

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:38.980
Now you have to appreciate the wisdom that Jesus used in selecting Paul as an Apostle

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.620
to the nations.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.379
And note to the elders, Paul was flexible.

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:50.100
He didn't insist on his own ideas, even when he felt strongly about a matter.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.899
And he didn't create unnecessary issues.

00:09:53.899 --> 00:09:59.899
Paul looked at the big picture, what a marvelous example for us.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:03.899
And we can say that humble Paul was the right man for the job.
