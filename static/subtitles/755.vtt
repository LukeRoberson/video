00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:11.099
The year was 608 BCE, the Prophet Jeremiah had already served nearly 40 years faithfully.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.699
And now he was confined in the courtyard of the guard in Jerusalem.

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.100
Jerusalem's walls were being battered by the Babylonians.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.500
Unless then a year the entire city would be completely destroyed.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.100
But Jeremiah had to weather this storm.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.100
There was no way out.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.179
There was no place for him to go.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.310
He was under lockdown.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:39.229
Will have you ever felt like Jeremiah as if the world was caving in on you?

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:42.109
Maybe it was a serious health scare.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.350
The health of a loved one.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.369
The death of a loved one.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:51.969
Maybe COVID-19 has made you feel boxed in.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.969
Some of our brothers just like Jeremiah have faced persecution or imprisonment.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.689
And that might be our lot before the end of the system of things.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:06.849
But what will help you students, in fact all of us, during these critical last days

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:13.530
when we face personal trials or adversity, I invite you to open to Jeremiah chapter 32.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.209
Let's consider a dramatic illustration in the life of Jeremiah.

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.170
Now Jeremiah is under lockdown.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.810
Jeremiah 32, let's read verses 6-8.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.689
Jeremiah said, the word of Jehovah has come to me saying,

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.689
Here, Hannah Mel, the son of Shalom, your uncle, will come to you and say,

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.409
Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth because you have the first right to repurchase it.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.489
Verse 8, Hannah Mel, the son of my uncle came to me just as Jehovah had said into the court

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:49.250
yard of the guard and he said to me,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.049
Please buy my field in Anathoth and the land of Benjamin for you have the right to take

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.290
possession of it and to repurchase it.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.930
Buy it for yourself.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.890
At that I knew that this was by the word of Jehovah.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.489
What was Jehovah's instruction to Jeremiah?

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.329
Buy a field.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.289
Buy a field right now with the Babylonians beating on the door?

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:19.289
Jeremiah might have thought, I need an escape plan, not a field of all places, Anathoth?

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.490
Where was Anathoth?

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.250
Well, Jeremiah knew exactly where it was just a few miles north northeast of Jerusalem.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.969
He was born there into a priestly family.

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:35.330
Did he have pleasant memories of his past and Anathoth as a youth?

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.330
Very likely.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.569
But now that was a distant memory.

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.610
More recently, men of Anathoth, possibly some of Jeremiah's own relatives, threatened

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.050
to kill him because of his prophesy.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.409
Well, did Jeremiah obey in spite of any personal feelings he might have had?

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.330
Jeremiah always obeyed.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.409
Even previously, when Jehovah told him not to take a wife or to have children, well,

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.009
what did he do in this situation versus nine and ten?

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:09.569
So I bought the field in Anathoth from Hannibal, the son of my uncle.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.050
I weighed out the money to him, seven shekels and ten silver pieces.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.490
When I recorded it in a deed, I fixed the seal called in witnesses and weighed the money

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.169
in the scales.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:25.090
Jeremiah could have worked in the legal department.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.569
Well, he carried out the legal transaction, the legal requirements of the transaction.

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.169
He recorded the transaction in two deeds, one sealed, one unsealed, complete transparency

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.569
in this situation.

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.370
Why did Jehovah ask Jeremiah to buy a field in Anathoth?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.969
Jeremiah already had complete faith that, yes, Jehovah's Word would be restored.

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:53.449
When seven years had transpired, the Jews would return to their homeland.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:58.889
But now, Jehovah reinforced Jeremiah's faith by giving something specific to think

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.210
about.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.370
Jeremiah could imagine the time when buying and selling would again occur in Israel.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.810
Well, was Jeremiah's faith well placed in Jehovah's promise?

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.610
Absolutely.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.689
Ezra, later documented that 128 men of Anathoth were among the first group of those returning

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:26.930
from Babylonian exile, and Jehovah's Word always comes true.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.529
Well, how might we, how might you buy a field in Anathoth?

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.970
Well, we're not expecting you to go out and purchase a piece of property and a place

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.970
called Anathoth.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:50.680
No, we find a clue, though, in Hebrews chapter 11, Hebrews chapter 11, verse 1, faith is

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.360
the assured expectation of what it's hoped for.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.540
The evident demonstration of realities that are not seen, the simple English Bible renders

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.379
this, faith is the title deed up to the things that we hope for.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.220
And on most of us in special full-time service, we don't own property.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.860
But we may have the title to a car.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.860
What does that mean?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.819
That means that that car, that vehicle, belongs to us personally.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.100
Our faith is the title deed of good things to come.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:33.339
A guarantee of future realities, Jeremiah had a title deed, we have a title deed of faith.

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.339
So how do we buy a field in Anathoth?

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:40.699
It's not a type, anti-type situation, it's just an illustration.

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:47.860
In the context of our discussion, it means we exercise faith in Jehovah's promises.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.939
When facing a trial, we can search Jehovah's word for promises regarding the future.

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:57.459
And that gives us strength to keep on enduring.

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:04.259
For example, if we're facing a serious illness, God's word promises, no resident will say,

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.379
I am sick.

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:12.660
If we're grieving the death of a loved one, the Bible assures us there is going to be

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.420
a resurrection.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:21.860
The trial doesn't disappear yet, but exercising faith in Jehovah's promises helps us to endure.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.019
Now, there's something else that we can learn from that dramatic illustration in the life

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:28.019
of Jeremiah.

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:34.060
Back in Jeremiah 32, notice please, verses 13 through 15.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.300
Jeremiah was inspired to write, he said, I now commanded Baruch in their presence, saying,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.899
this is what Jehovah of Armies, the God of Israel says.

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:50.019
Take these deeds, this deed of purchase, the sealed one, and the other deed left unsealed

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:55.259
and put them into an earthenware vessel so that they may be kept for a long time.

00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:01.500
For this is what Jehovah of Armies, the God of Israel says, houses and fields and vineyards

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:06.129
will again be bought in this land.

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:12.250
Jeremiah involved Baruch in the legal proceedings when he bought the field in Anathoth.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.449
Jeremiah's faith influenced Baruch for the good.

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.449
We can almost hear the confidence and conviction in his voice.

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:24.970
This is what Jehovah of Armies, the God of Israel says.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.250
Jeremiah used that expression, Jehovah of Armies, more than any other Bible writer.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.569
It was like Jeremiah said, our God will certainly overturn the Babylonians.

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:34.889
These promises are real.

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:40.930
You can take them to the bank, they're not counterfeit, they're completely true.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.689
What's the lesson for us?

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:47.610
Our faith can strengthen fellow believers.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.850
A sister named Joyce, while she herself was fighting cancer, she made what she called

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.529
shot in the arm cards.

00:07:56.529 --> 00:08:02.129
They were collections of Bible verses, pictures from our publications, quotes from theocratic

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:07.410
songs, or watched our articles, and she would give them to those in need of encouragement.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.290
One of her favorites was Psalm 112, 7 and 8.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.970
And there it says, he will not fear bad news.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.490
His heart is steadfast trusting in Jehovah.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.810
His heart is unshakable, he is not afraid.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.610
In the end, he will look and triumph on his adversaries.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.449
Sister Joyce had a lot of bad news in her life.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:34.929
But her faith in Jehovah's promises was powerful.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:41.970
Sadly Joyce lost her fight with cancer a few years back, but she bought a field in Anathoth,

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:47.649
and she will witness the fulfillment of Jehovah's promises.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:52.129
Even now she's given us a shot in the arm, encouragement from Jehovah's Word strengthened

00:08:52.129 --> 00:08:54.129
us with her faith.

00:08:54.129 --> 00:08:58.169
And so dear Gilead students, what have we learned?

00:08:58.169 --> 00:09:01.610
Faith is like a title deed of things hoped for.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.929
Faith in Jehovah's Word helps us to endure trials and adversity.

00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:09.889
Our faith can have a power effect on those around us.

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:14.269
So when faced with persecution, buy a field in Anathoth.

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:18.210
When faced with a grievous health problem, buy a field in Anathoth.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.769
When grieving the loss of loved one, buy a field in Anathoth, and someday soon your faith

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:29.370
will be rewarded, you'll walk in that field when Jehovah's Word comes true.
