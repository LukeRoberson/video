00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:15.019
In today's media, much of what's presented as fact is often colored by emotion and personal opinion.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:27.730
Jehovah's Witnesses, however, remain committed to defending God's word the Bible as the standard for truth.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.729
As Jesus said at John 17-17, your word is truth.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:42.729
The wide-ranging subject matter contained in the publications of Jehovah's Witnesses is painstakingly researched by their writing research department.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:48.729
Their research methods are modeled after that of Bible historians such as Luke and Jeremiah,

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.729
reliance on reputable first-hand sources.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.729
We're not looking just for someone's opinions or what someone believes about a topic.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.730
If the material is socially or politically biased, for example, we can't rely on it. We look for objective material.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.730
We cover everything from historical, scientific, geographical, flora, fauna, space.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.730
So before the script is even written, we'll provide a research package and we'll follow the project to final delivery,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.730
to make sure that everything that is said, everything that is shown, is solidly based in fact and it's well researched.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.730
There's a lot more research than what the viewer or the reader will ever see.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.730
Jehovah, one page article on the other, you end up with like 12 references to back up every statement that's made.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
It seems very simple, the height of Mont Blanc.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.730
And with the height of Mont Blanc, we found out number one was 4807 meter.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.730
Then we found another source, 4810.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.730
Let's check a third one, 4808. So what is now real?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.730
In that case, we had to consult the French National Institute of Geography and Forestry Information.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.730
One of our main research tools is our own library system.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.729
We have about 65,000 books and other research materials.

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:22.729
If we're researching something about ancient history or archaeology, we may consult a specialized encyclopedia,

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:26.729
like an encyclopedia of archaeological discoveries, for example.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:36.729
Museum websites usually have pictures of what they have in the museum and we can find these visuals and then send those off to production teams as well and say this is a good example of a first century lamp.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:44.729
Things that you think are true because they are commonly known may not actually be totally accurate.

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:50.729
So the research work we're doing, sometimes it takes a lot of time, a lot of effort.

00:02:50.729 --> 00:03:02.729
Sometimes we don't find what we're expecting to find, but it's very gratifying because we're helping produce accurate information that our readers can rely on.

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.729
Reliable information will help us make good informed decisions.

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:16.729
Anyone who reads our journal, who sees our videos, can be confident, well, this was thoroughly researched. These are facts, this is the truth.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:28.729
So when you consider the printed publications of Jehovah's Witnesses or peruse the JW.org website, you can be confident that the material is carefully researched and accurate.

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:35.729
Why? Because Jehovah's Witnesses are a people who love and respect the truth.
