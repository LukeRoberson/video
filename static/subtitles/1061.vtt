00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.490
Do you own a car, or a motorbike, or some other type of vehicle?

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.490
If you do, you realize that it brings with it a serious responsibility.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.489
Initially, it costs quite a bit of money to buy a vehicle, but also you need to keep on spending money to keep it running.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:28.489
In addition to that, there is another serious responsibility that comes with owning a vehicle.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:41.490
And that is the responsibility to maintain it safely, so that it doesn't break down, doesn't cause accidents, and most importantly doesn't cause loss of life.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:51.490
Of course, if you have a maintenance program, you're not just going to wait for something to fall off the vehicle, or perhaps for it just to stop.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:59.490
But rather ahead of time, you have to have a checklist to see that everything is working properly.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:09.489
Well, in a similar way, spiritually speaking, each one of us needs a maintenance program with regard to our spirituality.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:13.489
What sort of maintenance program are we talking about?

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:22.489
Well, let's take our Bibles, please, and turn to the second book of Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 5.

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:28.489
Second Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 5.

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:34.489
There it says, keep testing whether you are in the faith.

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:38.489
Keep proving what you yourselves are.

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:46.489
Or do you not recognize that Jesus Christ is in union with you unless you are disapproved?

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:53.489
So notice right in the beginning of that verse it says, keep testing, keep proving.

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.489
What does that really mean?

00:01:55.489 --> 00:02:02.489
Well, if you look at this study note associated with verse 5, it tells us this.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:13.490
One lexicon states that the word Paul here uses for testing means to endeavour to discover the nature or character of something.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:25.490
They could discover the nature of their own spiritual standing by comparing their daily conduct, attitudes and decisions with the sacred truths they were taught.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.490
Doing such testing would help them to keep proving that they were true Christians.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:41.490
For proving, Paul uses a word that could refer to testing whether something is genuine as one might test metals.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.490
Do we see the point of what this verse tells us?

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.490
As Christians, we need to keep testing continually that we are in the faith.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.490
But now, what does this word faith mean in this context?

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:08.490
It's not just referring to the quality of faith, but rather it involves all the Christian teachings that we find in God's Word of the Bible.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:21.490
So having that in mind, keep testing, keep proving, really means that we need to look at ourselves and see if we're really living up to what the Bible tells us to do.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.490
Now that's a very serious maintenance program.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:38.490
But just as we do a maintenance program for a vehicle and we might have a checklist, is there a checklist that we can use when we're testing and proving that we're in the faith?

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.490
Yes, there is. We can say there are three things.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:50.490
First of all, we need to ask heart-searching questions about our relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.490
That's the first point. Ask the questions that will search through our heart.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.490
Secondly, we have to answer honestly.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.490
Yes, whatever we see is an answer to those questions, then we need to have a correct answer.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:26.490
And then finally, we need to seek Jehovah's help in making whatever adjustments we need to make so that we can maintain a spirituality strong and in good standing so that our relationship with Jehovah is good.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.490
So with that in mind, let's go back to the illustration we started with, a vehicle, a car or a motorbike.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:49.490
If you were to compare our Christian faith or our belief, our conduct to a vehicle and the need to maintain it, what sort of things would you make as a comparison?

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.490
Well, perhaps the first thing we might think about is the engine.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:01.490
You certainly need to make sure the engine works correctly because that's what gives the vehicle the power to keep moving.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:12.490
So it's good for us to ask the question, what is it that moves us or motivates us so that we serve Jehovah acceptably?

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:22.490
Well, the answer is found in the scriptures, and if we turn together to the first book of Timothy, chapter four and verse eight.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.490
That's first Timothy, chapter four and verse eight.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.490
See if you can discern what it is that we could liken to the engine in a car.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:53.490
It tells us, for physical training is beneficial for a little, but godly devotion is beneficial for all things as it holds promise of the life now and the life that is to come.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:00.490
Did you see what the scripture tells us is so important, godly devotion.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.490
But we need to understand what godly devotion is.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.490
In fact, we also need to appreciate this beautiful expression in the New World translation.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.490
Many other Bibles just simply translate this as godliness.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:30.490
Godliness is beneficial or perhaps they say godly training or being religious or even one version says mental training.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:42.490
But the New World translation captures the meaning of the original word here because you can train or program a robot to do a certain job.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.490
But you can't program it to have godly devotion. Why not?

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.490
Because godly devotion involves how we feel about your hover.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:59.490
It means our loyalty to him based on a heart full of love and appreciation.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:10.490
So when it says godly devotion is important, it really involves why we do things, not just what we do.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:18.490
Well, let's think back to our illustration of the vehicle and you want to test the engine.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.490
What would you do to check the engine to see if it's okay?

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:31.490
Well, one thing you might do is keep an eye on the temperature gauge because if the engine is overheating, you know there's a problem.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.490
Or perhaps you might check the oil to see if there's enough oil.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.490
Or you may check to see if you've changed the oil regularly enough.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:50.490
Or when the engine is idling, you might listen carefully to it to see if it's running smoothly or roughly.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:55.490
And of course you'd be interested if there's any strange sounds or noises.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:04.490
So that's the type of thing you would have on a checklist when you're trying to see if an engine is working properly.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.490
Now, none of that applies to godly devotion, does it?

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:17.490
But what could be on our checklist for us to test godly devotion to see if it's healthy and strong or not?

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.490
Well, again, the Bible helps us.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:28.490
If you turn with me this time to the book of Psalms, let's look at Psalm 40 and verse 8.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:33.490
That's Psalm 40 and verse 8.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:40.490
Here it tells us, to do your will, oh my God, is my delight.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.490
And your law is deep within me.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:50.490
Now, this is a test of our godly devotion. How so?

00:08:50.490 --> 00:09:01.490
Well, we need to ask ourselves, is my service to God something that I really delight in or is it simply a chore?

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:08.490
Is it something that I do as a mere routine, something that I just keep on doing regularly,

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:14.490
but don't really have a strong desire to accomplish it?

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:21.490
Well, if we were thinking that our godly devotion was not so good, not so strong,

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:29.490
perhaps we were just doing things out of routine rather than for our love for Jehovah, we need to take action.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:37.490
Just the same as if we heard that the engine had a knocking sound or if we saw that it was overheating.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:45.490
And that's exactly what Jesus told the brothers back in the first century in the congregation in Ephesus.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:53.490
Please turn with me to the book of Revelation 2.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:10:02.490
And you'll remember in this section of the book of Revelation as a series of messages that Jesus gives different congregations.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.490
Now, the first congregation mentioned is in Ephesus.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:15.490
If you look at chapter 2 of Revelation, and if we glance through verses 2 and 3, what do you notice?

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:22.490
Well, Jesus says to the brothers, I know your deeds and your labor and endurance. That sounds good, doesn't it?

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.490
Then he goes on to say that they didn't tolerate bad men.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:34.490
And then in verse 3, he mentions that they persevered, that they had not grown weary.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.490
So what do we assume from these two verses?

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:45.490
That our brothers back then in the first century in the congregation in Ephesus were busy doing the work of Jehovah.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:50.490
Yes, they were active, they weren't giving up.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.490
But then what does Jesus say in verse 4?

00:10:54.490 --> 00:11:02.490
Nevertheless, I hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.490
Do we see the point?

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:16.490
Clearly, it shows us that Jehovah and Jesus are not just interested in what we do, but also why we do it.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:25.490
Yes, they want us to serve our God, Jehovah, in a way that shows that we love Him and that we are loyal to Him.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.490
Just the same as Jesus loves His Father and is loyal to Him.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.490
And this is so important.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:40.490
The Apostle Paul highlighted this, if you turn with me, please do 1 Corinthians chapter 13.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:50.960
1 Corinthians chapter 13, and notice what Paul says under inspiration in verse 3.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:12:04.960
And if I give all my belongings to feed others, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but I do not have love, I do not benefit at all.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:17.500
Now, if we look across at this study note on this verse, notice that it says, speaking hypothetically, Paul says that,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:33.500
even instead of love, such pride were his motive, he would give everything he owned to feed others, or would even die a martyr's death as a witness to the truth, but he would not benefit at all.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.500
Isn't that food for thought?

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:46.500
So thinking about this expression, godly devotion, it's interesting that one Bible scholar defined the original word this way.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:54.500
He said, it is a very practical awareness of God in every aspect of life.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:07.500
So if we were to check our godly devotion, and we see that perhaps it's not really working as well as it should, maybe it needs maintenance.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.500
What sort of maintenance would we give it?

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:20.500
Well, surely we would need to think of Jehovah more often every day to see him as part of our life.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:33.500
Also meditating on what Jehovah has done for us builds up appreciation and love for him, and that motivates us to do what Jehovah wants us to do out of love.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.500
Yes, our heart full of appreciation.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:45.840
And of course, offering prayers regularly to Jehovah helps to strengthen that relationship.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.840
So what have we learned so far in our discussion?

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:56.840
Well, just like the engine of a vehicle needs to be maintained, we need to be aware of whether or not it's operating correctly.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:08.840
In a similar way, we need to ask ourselves honest questions, questions that search our hearts with regard to our godly devotion.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:17.840
Is our service to Jehovah by simply on routine and a sense of duty? Do we view it just as a chore?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:24.840
Or does our heart show that it's filled with appreciation and love for Jehovah?

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:34.840
Well, if we build up that appreciation and love, we can be sure that our godly devotion is good. Yes, it's well maintained.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:44.840
So that's the first point of comparison that we'd like to make in the maintenance schedule for a vehicle and for our spirituality.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:52.840
So let's think of another comparison, another very important part of any vehicle, the other breaks.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.840
Now, when we think of the breaks, they're absolutely necessary, aren't they?

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:10.840
Because someone could jump in front of your vehicle, there could be someone who perhaps is coming too quickly and you have to avoid them and you need to use those breaks.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:19.840
So what do you think we could compare the breaks to with regard to our service to Jehovah and our relationship with Him?

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:28.840
Well, the Bible gives us a clue. As we read Psalm 111, we'll see the answer to that question.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:37.759
So as we turn there to Psalm 111, let's see what verse 10 tells us.

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:42.759
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:52.039
All those observing His orders show good insight, His praise endures forever.

00:15:52.039 --> 00:15:57.039
So do you see what could be likened to the breaks of a vehicle?

00:15:57.039 --> 00:16:03.039
What is it that stops us from doing something that displeases Jehovah?

00:16:03.039 --> 00:16:06.039
It's our fear of Jehovah.

00:16:06.039 --> 00:16:19.039
So just as you need to maintain the breaks in a vehicle, we also need to make sure that our love for Jehovah and our fear of Jehovah is strong and well maintained.

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:23.039
Now, of course, we need to think, what do we mean by fear of Jehovah?

00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:28.039
Do we mean shaking all the time, worried that He's going to do something wrong to us?

00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:35.039
No. Perhaps we could liken it to a chef who has a razor sharp knife.

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:42.039
Now, this knife, when used properly, can help him to attain all sorts of wonderful things.

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:46.039
But if he misuses it, then he has a problem.

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:53.039
So in a similar way, if our relationship is strong with Jehovah, there's no need for us to be shaking in our boots as it were.

00:16:53.039 --> 00:16:58.039
But rather, we need to remember always that Jehovah is with us.

00:16:58.039 --> 00:17:06.039
And so a healthy fear of Jehovah means that we don't want to displease Him in any way.

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:19.039
So a fear of Jehovah helps us so that as we're moving along, if anything comes our way, we're ready to stop if we shouldn't engage in that activity.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:25.039
So let's think for a few moments about the maintenance check for the breaks.

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:30.039
What would you do? How would you check if the breaks are okay or not?

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:37.039
Well, mechanics tell us that if you're applying pressure to the breaks and you find the steering wheel is starting to shake,

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:40.039
that's a sign that maybe they need attention.

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:51.039
Or if you apply pressure to the breaks and the vehicle starts to veer off to one side, again, not a good sign.

00:17:51.039 --> 00:18:01.039
Or as you press the brake pedal, if you find there's very little resistance and you have to start pumping it, again, that's a problem.

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:11.039
And of course, like with the engine, if you start to hear strange grinding noises, that is never a good sign isn't.

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:15.039
Well, what about our fear of Jehovah?

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:22.450
How can we test whether or not our fear of Jehovah is at the right level?

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:31.450
Well, we know that Satan and his world constantly throw things at us, temptations, wrong thinking, and so on.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:41.450
So it's just like you're driving in a vehicle and someone jumps out in front of you on animal runs across the road, that's when we need those breaks.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.450
But how do we apply them?

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.450
How does our godly fear help us?

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:56.450
Well, let's turn to the book of 2 Corinthians and see a very interesting point that is mentioned to the brothers back there in Corinth.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:03.450
So 2 Corinthians chapter 10, and we're going to look at verse 5.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:09.450
Now, the context of this chapter is where Paul is talking about wrong teachings.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:19.450
But the principle, as outlined in this verse, can be applied also to our reaction to wrong thoughts and immoral thoughts,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:24.450
or all sorts of things that are not in harmony with Jehovah's will.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.450
So let's see if we can see what the principle is.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:32.819
2 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 5.

00:19:32.819 --> 00:19:39.819
For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God.

00:19:39.819 --> 00:19:47.819
And we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:50.819
So do we see the point?

00:19:50.819 --> 00:19:55.819
No matter what sort of thought it is, if it's an immoral thought,

00:19:55.819 --> 00:20:02.819
a temptation to do something wrong, something that's not neutral with regard to the political situation,

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:09.819
what does it say here? We have to react quickly. It's just as if we put on the brakes.

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:15.819
Yes, we have to overturn all these sort of things that could be going on in our mind.

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:22.819
So obviously it's important for us to test our Godly fear in the sense of thinking,

00:20:22.819 --> 00:20:25.819
how do I normally react?

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:30.819
If I'm faced with a situation that perhaps tempts me, am I quick to react?

00:20:30.819 --> 00:20:37.819
Do the brakes work properly or is my Godly fear compromised?

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:40.819
An interesting question.

00:20:40.819 --> 00:20:48.819
Also another illustration, just imagine that in your car you find a whole lot of poisonous spiders.

00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:50.819
Well that's not good, isn't?

00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:54.819
Of course you get someone to help you get rid of those spiders.

00:20:54.819 --> 00:20:59.819
Now after you've paid that person to do the job, how would you feel if they said,

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:02.819
well we got most of them, it could be one or two left.

00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:04.819
I don't think you'd be very happy, would you?

00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:09.819
Because you won all of those poisonous spiders out of the car.

00:21:09.819 --> 00:21:12.819
But what does it tell us here in verse 5?

00:21:12.819 --> 00:21:21.819
It says we have to get all the things that are out of harmony with Jehovah under control.

00:21:21.819 --> 00:21:27.819
Yes, we could find that even though most of the things are under control,

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:33.819
there could be just a few areas where we haven't got them under control.

00:21:33.819 --> 00:21:38.819
It could even be that as if we're going in the wrong direction.

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:44.819
Well what do you need to do if you find out you're driving on the highway in the wrong direction?

00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:48.819
Stop, turn around and go the opposite direction.

00:21:48.819 --> 00:21:55.819
So isn't that exactly what we should do when it comes to this matter of checking our Godly fear?

00:21:56.819 --> 00:22:01.819
Yes, if we see that in any way we're a little slow in reacting

00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:05.819
when immoral temptations come our way or other wrong thinking,

00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:09.819
then we need to strengthen our fear for Jehovah.

00:22:09.819 --> 00:22:14.819
Yes, our fear of Jehovah helps us to resist these things.

00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:19.819
Now what's something that can help to strengthen our fear of Jehovah?

00:22:19.819 --> 00:22:22.819
Well again the Bible gives us an indication.

00:22:22.819 --> 00:22:26.819
This time we find it in the book of Proverbs.

00:22:26.819 --> 00:22:30.819
Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13.

00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:36.819
And you'll notice this is a little definitional formula for us.

00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:39.819
Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 13.

00:22:39.819 --> 00:22:48.230
The fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.230
So what is it that can help us strengthen our fear of Jehovah?

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.230
We need to hate what is bad.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.230
Now for a moment let me ask you this question.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.230
Is there some type of food that you really hate?

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.230
I know I can think of a couple of things that I just,

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:11.640
I really can't eat and I hate them.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.640
If someone tries to tempt you to eat that food,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.640
are you going to give in easily?

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.640
Of course not, because you hate that type of food.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:28.640
Well how much more important it is for us to develop within ourselves a hatred for what is bad.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.640
Yes we have to make sure that when we see things that Jehovah hates,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.640
that we feel the same way, that we don't accept them.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:46.640
Never would we allow gradualism to change our feelings with regard to what Jehovah says is wrong.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.640
Now as we read on looking back at Proverbs chapter 8 verse 13,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.640
notice it says the fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:06.640
Then it says, I hate self-exaltation and pride and the evil way and perverse speech.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:13.640
So we need to make sure that we take out of our hearts any sort of pride

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.640
that could interfere with our relationship with Jehovah.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.640
That's very important and that's part of hating what Jehovah hates.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.640
Just think for a moment, as we're doing this checklist to see how our fear of Jehovah is,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.640
is it strong or weak?

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:37.640
We need to think about what things do I really feel proud about?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.640
Is there something that deep inside you you feel?

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.640
Yes, I feel really proud about this.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.640
We'll never forget David's son Absalom.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.640
He was proud about his hair.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.640
But in the end it was his hair that goes into the problem and he ended up dying

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.640
because of his hair being caught in the branches.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.640
So never would we want to be like Absalom

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:11.640
and allow the thing that we are proud of to actually cause us a serious problem.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.640
So that's been interesting, hasn't it?

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.640
Looking at a second comparison between the maintenance of a car

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.640
and the maintenance of our Godly fear.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:29.640
Just like the brakes, Godly fear can help us to stop before we do something

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.640
that would displace Jehovah.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:38.640
Now of course, when we're thinking of this matter of comparing the maintenance of a vehicle

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.640
with the maintenance of our spirituality,

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.640
there are so many different comparisons that we could make.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.640
And your mind's probably already going there thinking of,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.640
well, will we make this comparison or that one?

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.640
But we only have time for one more comparison.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.640
And you probably won't think of the one that we're going to talk about.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.640
That is the horn.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.640
You see in some parts of the world drivers say the horn is just as important as the brakes.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.640
Why?

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.640
Because they need to let people know they're driving along the road.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.640
It could be someone is beside them and they're about to change lanes and crash into them.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.640
Well, the horn can help.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.640
Or it could be someone is distracted and they're crossing the road.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.640
Again, the horn will help.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.640
The horn used correctly can save lives.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.640
So what do you think we're going to compare the horn to with regard to our spiritual activities?

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.640
Well, if we read 1 Timothy together,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.640
1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 16,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.640
we'll see what the comparison is.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.640
1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 16.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:01.980
Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.980
Persevere in these things.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:10.980
For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:16.980
So we could say that just as a horn is important with regard to a vehicle,

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.980
likewise, our sounding out the message of the good news,

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:30.980
out teaching others and telling them about the nearness of your harvest day can result in lives being saved.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.980
But now, if you were to check a horn,

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:38.980
what would you be looking for or pass more importantly listening to?

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.980
Well, for a start, you'd try to test the horn and honk it.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.980
Now, if the no sound comes out, you know you have a problem.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:52.980
Or on the other hand, if the sound is too soft that nobody can hear it,

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.980
that likewise is a problem.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.980
So what about us?

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.980
Do we need to think about how our proclamation of the good news is?

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.980
Yes.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:09.980
Let's take not just the normal activities we're involved with without preaching work,

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.980
but what about informal witnessing?

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.980
Do you see the opportunity?

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:20.980
Do you think, yes, I need to talk to this person and nothing happens.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.980
The horns are working in a symbolic sense.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.980
Or perhaps we do have the opportunity and we take it,

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.980
but the message is not clear.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.980
So persons don't really understand what we're saying.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.980
So if either of those were the case,

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:45.980
we'd need to see that maintenance is required with regard to this symbolic horn.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.980
What would we do?

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.980
Well, it could involve praying to Jehovah for courage,

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.980
here's boldness to be able to witness to others,

00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:00.980
whether it's informally telephone witnessing or other forms of witnessing.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:07.980
And then if we're not so clear or coherent with regard to how we present the message,

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.980
how important it is for us to practice ahead of time,

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.980
to have special sessions where we practice what we'll say,

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:21.980
and then this way we can be ready to give a clear message to those who listen.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.980
Well, that's been a very interesting exercise, hasn't it?

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.980
What did we see?

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.980
If we're using this comparison, this illustration of a vehicle,

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:36.980
we could say that the engine of a vehicle is like our godly devotion.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.980
Our devotion of Jehovah needs to come from our hearts.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:45.980
And the brakes of a vehicle we could liken to our fear of Jehovah.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.980
Yes, if we hate what is bad the same as Jehovah does,

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.980
it will stop us just like brakes do.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:58.980
And then finally we discuss this matter of having a horn that sounds the message properly.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:04.980
Yes, we need to make sure that we ask Jehovah's help to maintain our witnessing

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:09.980
in such a way that we can clearly help others to hear the message.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.980
So as we've gone through this, I'm sure, as we've already mentioned,

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.980
you can think of many other comparisons.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:25.980
But the point is, a wise driver does not just drive his car or motorbike

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.980
or whatever vehicle it is.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:35.980
A wise driver also checks to make sure that the vehicle is safe to use.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:41.980
So likewise, for us as 2 Corinthians 13 verse 5 says,

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.980
we need to keep testing.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.980
Yes, we need to keep proving that we are in the faith.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.980
In other words, keep checking that we really are Christians,

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:57.980
that we are really living up to what we believe and what we teach others to do.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.980
But remember, what is it that can be a problem for us?

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.980
Well, again, if we turn to the book of Corinthians this time,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:11.980
1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 12,

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.980
we'll see what the problem can be.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:20.980
That's 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 12.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:26.980
Let the one who thinks he is standing aware that he does not fall.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.980
Yes, just thinking everything is okay.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:34.980
There's no problems thinking that we're just going on fine

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.980
without testing ourselves and proving that we're in the truth.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.980
That can be a problem.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.980
Just like lack of maintenance to a vehicle can result in not only damage

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.980
with regard to the vehicle, but also loss of life.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.980
How important than it is that we continue to keep testing.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:00.980
Whether or not we are in the faith or in the truth.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.980
So if we do these tests regularly and we check to see,

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.980
how is our godly devotion going, how is our fear of Jehovah,

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.980
our hatred for what is bad, how is our sounding out of the message going?

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:19.980
If we see some weaknesses, what do we need to do?

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.980
Well, our final scripture takes us back to our theme scripture.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.980
Remember that was 2 Corinthians chapter 13.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:32.980
And verse 5 is where it says keep testing, keep proving

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.980
that you yourselves, what you yourselves are.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:41.980
But then if we look down a little further to verse 11,

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:47.980
we'll notice what it tells us that we need to do if we see some problems.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:59.980
In verse 11 it tells us finally brothers continue to rejoice to be re-adjusted.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.980
Now what does this mean to be re-adjusted?

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:09.980
Well, if you look up at verse 9 you see the same expression is used there at the end of verse 9.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.980
And the study note to that verse tells us this.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:20.980
It says the word is used to describe the restoring of something to a proper condition.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:26.980
For instance at Matthew 421, the word is used to describe mending nets.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:32.980
So nets that are damaged or have holes in them, mending them is just like re-adjusting them.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:42.980
Ecalation 6.1 the same verb is used of the need to re-adjust spiritually a fellow believer who has taken a false step.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:51.980
The term is sometimes used in medical text to describe the setting of a barn, a limb or a joint.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.980
So what's the point?

00:33:53.980 --> 00:34:02.980
If we do this checklist, go through it and we see that somehow our godly devotion is not as strong as it should be.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:07.980
We're just doing things out of routine but our love for Jehovah is no longer strong.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:13.980
Or if we find that our fear of Jehovah is not stopping us from doing what is wrong.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:19.980
Or if we're finding that we just are not thoroughly bearing witness to the good news.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.980
Then we need to take action.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.980
What does it involve?

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:35.980
Well, as it says here, first of all identifying what the problem is, then re-adjusting, repairing and in some places replacing activities.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:44.980
Now brothers and sisters, let's always remember no matter how long we've been in the truth, no matter what privileges we have.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.980
We need to keep looking at that checklist.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:53.980
Yes, we need to keep testing and proving that we are in the faith.
