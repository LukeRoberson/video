WEBVTT

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:15.910
When you and I received new literature at conventions or in the Kingdom Hall, we always marvel at the work that goes into producing our magazines and other publications, the well-written articles, the beautiful artwork and how it builds our faith.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.910
But how often do we think about the efforts involved in getting the literature from Bethel to the hands of the publishers?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.659
Join us as we visit the shipping department at the Canada branch to learn more.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.659
If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will reach his mind.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:44.659
But if you talk to him in his mother tongue, you will not only reach the mind, but the heart.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.659
That's why we print our magazines in so many different languages.

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.659
For example, someone in your congregation may request a magazine in Subwano.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.659
In Canada, we print dozens of languages, but Subwano isn't one of them.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:11.019
It's printed in Japan. After it's printed, it's put into a box.

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:19.019
Customs paperwork is filled out, and it travels thousands of miles on a boat where we receive it in Canada.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:25.019
And that's the journey of just one magazine.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:32.579
We have hundreds that have to take the same trip.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.579
Each magazine is hand-picked by five or six people.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.579
They'll fill over 20,000 congregation orders in a couple of weeks.

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.579
Every order is checked for accuracy.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:02:00.650
You don't forget the fact that each order you fill represents a person that has specifically asked for that magazine.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.650
Hundreds of thousands of personal orders will be filled.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.650
No other organization does this.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:15.650
Goes to these lengths and to this expense to fill a handful of orders in some exotic language.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:24.650
But Jehovah's people do because we care about every single person who wants to hear the good news.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:36.219
Along with those finished cards, many items are printed and set aside to be merged together later.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.219
It all starts in local congregations.

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:46.689
Orders are placed and are later submitted online.

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.689
They're processed and automated machines count them out.

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:59.719
This is where our work starts.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:06.719
In order to complete each request, it takes a team of about a dozen people working together.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:11.719
First of all, a worker cartons and puts a label on the box.

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:21.719
The label contains all the information that's needed for that order and each person references it as the work is done.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.719
The foreign magazines that were prepared earlier are added.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:36.719
Then we add Kingdom Ministries, study edition watchtowers, as well as CDs and large print magazines.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:41.719
The work is hard and it doesn't let up.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.719
It's challenging to maintain the focus that you need.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.719
You want every order to be perfect.

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.719
We all do.

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:58.159
At the same time, you realize that everyone else is relying on you to keep up.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:05.159
It would be easy to look at the work as just a production line filled with hard workers.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.159
But there's a camaraderie here.

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:16.160
And a recognition that what we're doing will have an impact on people's lives.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:35.790
The first watchtower had a total circulation of 6,000 copies.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.790
One palette today may contain up to 50,000 magazines.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.790
One palette.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.790
In our warehouse during the peak periods, many hundreds of palettes will be stored.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.790
Waiting to be shipped?

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.790
We have well over a million pounds of literature during that time.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:02.259
There can be as many as four trucks a day leaving with finished palettes,

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.259
blanketing all of North America.

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:11.259
Others will go by train, plane, and boat to lands all over the earth.

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.600
The growth of the work is staggering.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.600
And you get to glimpse the scope of it when you work here.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.600
It's a privilege to be the last ones to work with the literature before it leaves for its destination.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.600
But we're just one branch out of many doing work on this scale.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:41.600
In the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Nigeria, Germany, Britain, Australia,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.600
Japan, India, and Korea, palettes and containers are going out to the field every day.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.009
And all of this starts with a single roll of paper.

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.009
Paper that was transformed into life-changing material.
