00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.750
We begin with an archived interview of Brother Allen Boyle.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.750
Among his many assignments, Brother Boyle spent 37 years in the art department at World Headquarters.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.750
The beautiful and accurate illustrations produce their enhanced hour study,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.750
helping us to visualize and meditate on what we are reading.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.750
An assignment to create these pictures is exciting,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.750
but it requires that a person have spiritual qualities.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.750
Artists collaborate and must humbly listen to each other's comments.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.750
They must apply direction from the faithful and discreet slave to prepare artwork

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.750
that we can take in as spiritual food.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.750
As you'll hear Brother Boyle describe, a person must be an avid student of the Bible.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:01:07.909
Listen to Brother Boyle's story and note what he said was needed for him to do his assignment well.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.909
I was born in 1933.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.909
I got to the age of 18, and one supper time my mother had invited the company servants,

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.909
as they were called back then, to come for supper.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.909
He asked me what I was going to do with my life.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.909
I said to him, well, I'm going to pioneer.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.909
The three weeks later, the convention in London, I got baptized,

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.909
and then went pioneering six months after that.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.909
I was 21 when I was on the circuit work, and that was a wonderful experience.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.909
And in those days, of course, you didn't have a car.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.909
I used to have a motorbike, and I'd go around the motorbike and my briefcase

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.909
and my typewriter and the clothes in the other case on the back.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.909
Yeah, that was very exciting.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.909
I was invited to go to Gilead, and that was wonderfully exciting.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.909
We had 103 in the class.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.909
Little did I know at that time that I would be sent as a missionary to Ireland.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:14.159
My friend had been invited to go down to London Bethel to do the artwork there.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.159
I'd always wanted to be in Bethel.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.159
I thought, well, why don't I just call him up and congratulate him?

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.159
So that's what I did.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.159
And he told me that he decided not to go in.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.159
So he said, if you're still interested, why don't you call him up and let them know?

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.159
So that's what I did.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.159
The next morning, I called up London Bethel, and within a week, I was in London Bethel.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.159
Doing the graphics work for the magazine.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.159
It was a wonderful thrilling experience.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:47.469
I was in London Bethel for a couple of years in 1977 to 1979,

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.469
and Brother Barry invited me to come over to Brooklyn Bethel.

00:02:51.469 --> 00:03:01.759
You know that you're doing something that's going to be beneficial and helpful to other people,

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:05.759
to people even in different languages and different cultures.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:11.759
Little painting that you do is going to help them to get a memory of something significant.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:19.330
One of the most beautiful things about working in the art department and doing paintings

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
is that it makes you do research.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
You have to investigate, is this the right time of the day?

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
Is it night? Is it day?

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
What's the sky looked like?

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.330
What was it like before the flood when Noah built the ark?

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
How did he paint underneath the ark?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
How did he waterproof it?

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330
Because that's the worst important part, isn't it?

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.330
He used bitumen.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
Okay, how did he get underneath the ark?

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.330
Maybe put it on still. You have to come up with all these little questions in your mind.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:04:16.410
To do the research was very rewarding.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.410
This is a little model of a boat.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.410
And underneath the deck they used to keep a ballast sack of 110 pounds of sand.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.410
It says in the scriptures that Jesus was a sleep on a pillow.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.410
Apparently this was the ballast sack that he was a sleep on.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.410
And actually in the Kingdom into linear translation,

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.410
it doesn't say he was a sleep on a pillow.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.410
It says he was a sleep on the pillow.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.410
So apparently back 2000 years ago in that area,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:49.569
everybody knew what the pillow was.

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.569
I remember meeting a brother once who'd been to Siberia.

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.569
And he'd taken a snapshot of somebody's kitchen in Siberia.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.569
And to my amazement on the wall,

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.569
pinned with drawing pins on the wall,

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.569
was one of the pages or the publications that we'd produced here at Brooklyn.

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.569
And so remarkably, it's wonderful to feel that whatever we do here,

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.569
if it's support work, if it's the painting,

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.569
and of course we need a lot of support work for the paintings,

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.569
all what we do here has an effect upon the brothers and sisters out there in the world,

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.569
wherever it might be.

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.569
And you really feel that your time is well worth spent.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.860
You're adorning the word of truth,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.860
you're helping other people to be taught something from the Bible,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.860
which is going to be to that benefit.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:50.199
It's been very rewarding and thrilling to be in Jehovah's service,

00:05:50.199 --> 00:06:11.730
and I've really enjoyed it.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.730
Alan Boyle finished his earthly course in 2016.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.730
Those in the art department who worked with him,

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.730
remember his enthusiasm and his thorough attention to detail.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.730
What Alan brought to his assignment was rooted in his own personal study

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.730
of the Bible.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.730
He founded Rewarding to do the research needed to illustrate Bible scenes.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.730
Today, the writing department supplies a team of researchers to assist the artists.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.730
But did you recall what Alan said helped his research?

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.730
He asked questions about the scenes he was painting.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.730
These same kinds of questions are part of the study methods

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.730
Gilead students learning class.
