00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:11.500
Are you amazed when you see the work Jehovah is accomplishing through the earthly part

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.699
of his organization?

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.780
Each year, more individuals are being reached with the good news.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.300
We're blessed with a variety of new spiritual food.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.460
Worldwide construction work is ongoing, and relief aid is provided to victims of disasters.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.299
The government has asked me to convey their deep appreciation for the gifts you give

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:39.619
of your time, energy, and resources to assist with this work.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:45.219
You may wonder, how do we make sure that we have the financial means needed to care for

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.060
all of this activity?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.380
Following the principle at Luke 1428, each year branch offices of Jehovah's Witnesses calculate

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.619
the expense of the projects needed and prepare a budget to ensure funds will be available.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:09.140
Your kind donations play a significant role in this budgeting process.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.420
You're following the principle at 1 Corinthians 16-2.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.980
Here the 1st century congregation was encouraged to plan their financial contributions.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.739
They were told, on the first day of every week, each of you should set something aside

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:28.620
according to his own means.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.019
Your generous and consistent practice of setting something aside helps us to be confident

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:39.900
that the work that's planned can be accomplished with Jehovah's blessings.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.219
In the following video, notice how throughout the history of Jehovah's modern-day organization,

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:53.340
brothers and sisters have benefited from the practice of setting something aside.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.739
Throughout the years, various arrangements have been used to set something aside.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:05.939
Starting in the early 1890s, an insert was provided in the December 15th issue of the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.939
Watchtower.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.139
Brothers and sisters could send this insert to the branch office to indicate how much they

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:18.139
hope to be able to contribute to the Good Hope's Fund in the coming year.

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:24.939
Starting this method of giving, the Watchtower of December 15, 1896 stated,

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:31.819
knowing in advance what the friends wish and hope to do enables us the better to regulate

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.620
the work economically and efficiently.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.780
However, the Watchtower of May 1, 1959, made it clear that this indication was not an obligation.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.020
It said, this is not a pledge, but merely a statement of what one hopes to be able to

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.620
contribute during the coming year.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.180
Today, using Donate.jw.org, there are various donation methods available to contribute what

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.419
one has set aside.

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:10.659
Recurring donations help to provide an indication of funds that are available.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:17.300
There's also an arrangement where one can set up a legally executed will to stipulate

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.259
what they wish to give to the organization, and this helps the organization plan better

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:23.740
for the future.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.419
They can cancel or change the arrangement according to their circumstances, but it gives them

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:37.020
an opportunity to experience Jehovah's Joy and give it.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.539
When I participated in the disaster relief work, I was really moved to see with my own eyes

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:45.819
how the donations were actually being used.

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:53.229
Because I wanted to express my appreciation for these activities, I set up an online donation.

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:57.870
From the monthly appreciation letters, we learned that the real needs of our brothers around

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.270
the world are being cared for through our donations.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:09.969
Those letters made me feel that I'm working unidently with Jehovah's organization.

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:17.129
The important decision we made was to follow the advice of the Apostle Paul to really put

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:20.129
aside a specific value.

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:26.290
So we planned, we calculated our costs, analyzed the situation, we prayed on the subject, and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.850
then we saw the importance of making a will.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.329
Jehovah gave us everything.

00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:37.810
So I think we're just returning what Jehovah gave us.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:47.920
I've come to realize that in general that contributions are not a pocket condition but a heart condition.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.720
Contributing to Jehovah's organization makes me happy.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.920
It helps me to set a reminder each month to contribute because there's a lot that could

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.839
cause me to forget.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:06.800
So setting the reminder helps me to remember to contribute towards Jehovah's organization.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.680
It doesn't matter whether we contribute a lot or a little but what is important is that

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.079
we contribute with our whole heart.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:20.819
That makes Jehovah very happy.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:26.899
It is heartwarming to see how Jehovah's people follow the principle at 1 Corinthians 16

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:34.220
2 and set something aside regularly to show their Christian love for the worldwide association

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.220
of brothers.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:43.139
These last days are bringing economic challenges to many of us, but please be assured that

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.939
Jehovah values what you do in his service no matter how small it may seem in your own

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.139
eyes.

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:57.699
It's our prayer that Jehovah continues to bless your practice of setting something aside.

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.220
Thank you for all you've done and continue to do.
