WEBVTT

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.690
Well, here's a question, do you see people as Jehovah's

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.690
system?

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.490
Now, that's a very practical question that comes up when we

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.289
read in the scriptures that they describe Noah as being

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.570
faultless among his contemporaries.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.489
Now, we all know that Noah was an imperfect human.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.809
So why would the Bible make the comment that Noah was

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.649
faultless?

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.890
Well, if you go to the insight volume two and page

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.890
a 604 under the article Perfection, there's a very, very

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.409
interesting discussion of this.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.409
And I want to read some of it to you.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:45.490
It says when talking about men like Noah and Job and others,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.770
it says it is clear that such men were faultless and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.170
blameless in the sense of measuring up fully to God's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.969
requirements for them, requirements that took into account

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.770
their imperfection and disability.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.849
Now, even as a potter, this is the illustration the

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.969
insight book uses, even as a potter would not expect

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.409
the same quality when molding a vase from common clay as

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.609
he would when forming one from special refined clay.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.010
So Jehovah's requirements take into consideration the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.530
weakness of imperfect humans, though committing errors

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.129
and wrongs because of their fleshly imperfection, such

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:35.170
faithful men nevertheless manifested a complete heart

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.769
toward Jehovah.

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:41.010
Thus, within the limits possible for them to attain,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.730
their devotion was complete, sound, satisfying the divine

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.290
requirements in their case.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.769
Since God, the judge was pleased with their worship, no human

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:58.689
or spirit creature could rightly find fault with them.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.010
Isn't that an interesting quote from the insight volume?

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.409
The June 1st 2008 watch tower just adds one more thought.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.210
It says notice that the Bible says he was faultless among,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.770
not from the viewpoint of his contemporaries.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.689
In other words, he was faultless in the eyes of God.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.569
But to the people of the pre-flood world,

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.490
Noah was odd.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.050
Well, that's an interesting comment, isn't it?

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.810
Well, maybe even the members of Noah's family might have

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.530
had some interesting comments about Noah.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.889
Maybe that's some of the questions, Sister Denise

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.330
Akri mentioned, some questions her Bible student would

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.169
like to ask.

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.009
Maybe we'd like to ask some questions like that about Noah.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.969
Did he have some annoying habits?

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.370
Did he snore?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.689
Noah was imperfect, right?

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:54.490
But from Jehovah's standpoint, he was faultless.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.810
He did everything that Jehovah expected him to do

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.449
given his imperfection.

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.729
Well, that highlights a very important truth,

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.289
which is that there is a difference

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:10.370
between the way that Jehovah sees people

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.770
and the way that we see people.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.490
But it should always be our desire to try

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.169
and see people the way that Jehovah can see them.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:26.889
When I think of some examples, let's start with King David.

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.969
Now, if you had to describe David's life course,

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.169
what would you say?

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:38.210
Well, would you begin by describing some of the major sins

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.370
that David had committed during his life?

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.370
See, maybe that's our human tendency

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.370
to right away think of the failure that we know about David.

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.729
But what does First Kings chapter 15 say?

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.330
Let's read this together.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.409
First Kings chapter 15 and verse five,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.340
it says, for David did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.580
and he did not turn aside from anything

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.139
that he had commanded him all the days of his life,

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.459
except in the matter of your eye of the Hittite.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.220
Now, isn't that an interesting description of David?

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.860
Probably for us, that's a pretty big accept, isn't it?

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.139
And yet, how did Jehovah see David?

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.660
How did he view him?

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.660
Well, again, let's look at First Kings chapter 11 and verse four.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.339
It says, in Solomon's old age,

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.699
his wives inclined his heart to follow other gods

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.220
and his heart, no, no, this and his heart

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.500
was not complete with Jehovah, his God,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.420
like the heart of David, his father.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:01.939
So from the standpoint of Jehovah,

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.420
David had a complete heart.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.579
Now, why was that?

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:08.540
Why was it that Jehovah could see David

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.019
as having a complete heart?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.259
Inside volume one, page 1211

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.259
under the article on integrity that says this,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.980
David committed several serious wrongs,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.420
but he nevertheless walked with integrity of heart

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.100
for he accepted, reproof and corrected his way.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.180
He thereby proved that his heart

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.819
still retained genuine love for Jehovah God.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.139
Well, whether we're speaking about Noah

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.259
or we're speaking about David,

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.300
Jehovah could see good in these men.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.579
He could view Noah as faultless and David

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:51.259
as having a complete heart.

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.139
When how do we view others?

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.980
We know how Jehovah sees people,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.420
but how do we view them?

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.180
Well, the human tendency is always to look for flaws

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.339
and imperfections and then to focus on these.

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.220
Well, now let me show you this.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.779
What do you see here?

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.339
One of those two ways you could answer,

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:16.899
you could say a piece of paper

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.259
or you could say a spot.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.579
When our human tendency would be to answer, I see a spot.

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.379
And that's the way we tend to look at other people.

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:32.180
We tend to immediately identify their weaknesses

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.180
and by focusing on those spots or blemishes,

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:38.379
what happens?

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:43.779
Well, often they tend to get bigger and bigger and bigger

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:47.860
so that now instead of seeing the good things

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.740
about our brothers, we become completely focused

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.180
on their negative qualities.

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.660
Yet if we were to actually speak to the individual involved,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.939
the actual person, maybe how do they see themselves?

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:03.980
Well, maybe it's sort of like this.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.620
You see, they see themselves as all black

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.980
with just that one, one small spot,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.300
maybe just one small bright spot in their life.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.980
And by focusing constantly on negatives and imperfections,

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.379
what's the effect?

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:24.259
Well, we could even close out that one bright spot.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.980
Brothers, what's the solution?

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.420
We have to learn to see people

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.060
the way Jehovah sees them.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.100
We have to learn from our Heavenly Father

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.819
and work very, very hard to be able to see them as He does.

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:43.620
That means we have to look for the good.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.699
We have to emphasize the good.

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:49.100
And if we don't see it initially or immediately,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.339
then we have to work hard to get to know our brothers better

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.819
so that we can identify clearly

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.819
their beautiful qualities.

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:00.899
So we come to see them the way Jehovah does.

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:02.819
What, when I served in the Philippines,

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.259
I was deeply moved by the experience

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:11.139
of a brother named Miguel, who while preaching in a prison,

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:16.139
met a man named Esmeraldo who had killed Miguel's own grandson.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.019
Now, Miguel was afraid when he met Esmeraldo in the prison

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:24.660
that he would try to kill him.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.579
So immediately when Esmeraldo approached him,

00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:31.660
Miguel began to explain to him truths from the Bible.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.419
Well, Esmeraldo was so moved by what he heard

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.899
that he admitted that he had committed the murder

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:42.899
and he apologized to Miguel for doing so.

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:47.379
Another brother was watching this scene from a distance

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:52.379
and he encouraged Miguel to start a Bible study with Esmeraldo.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.460
The brother had no idea of the connection

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.299
between the two men.

00:08:57.299 --> 00:09:02.299
Well, even so, Miguel did agree to study the Bible

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.659
with Esmeraldo and on April 1, 2010,

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:11.259
Esmeraldo was baptized as our Christian brother.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:14.700
Can you imagine, can you imagine how much effort

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.139
it would have taken for Miguel to be able to see Esmeraldo

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:22.059
in the way that Jehovah would come to see him,

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:24.299
but he was willing to make the effort?

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:28.299
Although it will never ever be easy,

00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:32.940
if we can learn to see others in the way that Jehovah sees them,

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.620
we'll focus on their good qualities,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.019
we'll be eager to help them to improve

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:42.340
and we may even have the joy of being able to serve

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.419
our wonderful God, Jehovah forever along with them.
