00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:27.539
Well, today we have the very great privilege to get acquainted with five faithful Christian women who share something unique.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.539
Each one was married to a member of the governing body who has now gone on to his heavenly reward.

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.539
There are nine such dear faithful sisters with us at Bethel.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:46.539
Sisters Lucille Henshel, Audrey Hyde, Margaret Klein and Charlotte Schroeder could not be with us today for this interview.

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.539
We treasure their faithful example as well.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.539
Now these sisters had a very demanding schedule while supporting their husbands in their work.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.539
But what were some of the blessings that they enjoyed?

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:59.539
Let's find out.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.539
So let's begin with Sister Sydney Barber.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.540
Sister Barber, could you tell us how you began in the full-time ministry?

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.540
Well, I was blessed to have parents who were faithful and diligent and they raised me with the idea that full-time service was to be my career.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.540
However, when I got out of school, I was offered a pretty good job that I really enjoyed.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:32.540
I took it and then thought about what reasons could I give to Jehovah while I was working full-time and not pioneering.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.540
Well, of course, I couldn't come up with any reasons and so I knew I had to quit this job, which I did.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.540
And the five years later, I was invited to Gilead and that's where I met my husband.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.540
All right, so we understand it was in 1956 that you married for the Kerry Barber.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
Can you tell us a little bit about some of his outstanding qualities?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.540
Well, first thing that attracted me to him was that he already had a long history in the full-time service.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.540
He had gone to Bethel in 1923, some 30 years before that.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.539
So I knew I had to marry, if I was going to marry, I had to marry someone with the same goal of full-time service.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.539
And then he was easygoing.

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.539
He didn't get easily excited or upset about things.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.539
He had a marvelous sense of humor.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:31.539
And all of this helped me a great deal because the very day after we were married, we started in the circuit work.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:39.539
And then for the next 22 years, I lived out of a suitcase, lived in the homes of the brothers and moved every week.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.539
Wonderful. Wow.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:45.539
That sounds like a demanding schedule, Sister Barber, but of course there were blessings.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:47.539
Oh, there were many blessings.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:59.539
Although at times I did feel very sorry for myself, but the blessings and the happiness, the joys were way far outweighed and he difficulties.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:14.539
One of the joys was to find interested people in the service and then find years later that whole extended families had come into the truth from that person that I contacted.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:18.539
Then when we came to Bethel, we did more international travel.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:25.539
Now often we went to maybe an exotic country, but we only saw the road from the airport to the branch and back again.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:31.539
And we didn't see the tourist attractions that most people would go to see.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.539
But we did see the desirable things, the precious things of the nations.

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.539
And that is Jehovah's people.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:51.539
It was such a thrill to go to a country like Myanmar and there meet perhaps sisters from the chin hills, little sisters that had learned the truth back in their own language,

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:59.539
the way out in the sticks you might say, or to go to the Andes and meet a little catch who a speaking brother.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:04.539
And to know that these are part of our family, that they're worshiping Jehovah.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.539
It's always been dear to my heart.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:08.539
Very nice.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:14.539
Well now Sister Barber, as you look back, what is it that you especially treasure?

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:20.540
Well, I'm very thankful that I was married to one of Christ's brothers.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:30.540
Just to hear his expressions on spiritual matters and to hear his appreciation for his service to Jehovah.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.540
He was a humble man and he didn't speak private or publicly about being one of the anointed.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:45.540
But privately he expressed great awe of that calling and great appreciation for it.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.540
So I'm very thankful that I was able to have 51 years of marriage with him.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:04.459
Thank you so much, Sister Barber.

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:08.459
Well, next on our program is Dear Sister Melba Berry.

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:15.459
Sister Berry, we'd like to know a little bit about how you got into the truth and how you started full-time service, please.

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:20.459
Well, I'm an Australian lassie born and raised in Australia.

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:29.459
Way down there in 1935, my mother accepted the truth and the brother that was going from door to door when he met her.

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:36.459
So being the eldest of three girls, I happened to be the only one that showed any interest and accepted the truth.

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:40.459
And that was I was baptized in 1939.

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:49.459
But in the small local congregation where I served, I was appointed as the company servant since no qualified brothers were available.

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:57.459
Brothers were assigned from Bethel to give talks in the congregation.

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:02.459
And so one brother came to the congregation for such an assignment.

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:15.459
And when he returned to Bethel, he told his buddy Lloyd Barry to come out to the congregation, give a talk and to look me over.

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:24.459
Eventually he came. Meanwhile, I applied to be a pioneer but was accepted to Bethel in Sydney in September 1939.

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:28.459
So began my 72 years of full-time service.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:35.459
Beautiful. Well, then in 1942, you married that brother who came to check you out.

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:38.459
What were some of his outstanding qualities, Sister Berry?

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:46.459
Well, he truly loved you over and the brothers. He was serious, he had a kind and courageous spiritual man.

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:52.459
But I thought a spiritual giant since I was such an immature person at that time.

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:59.459
And I thought I needed someone to help me get through him again that was so close at that time.

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.459
And Lloyd was a very decisive person.

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:11.459
And when he'd learned the truth in his teenage years, he came to appreciate that serving Jehovah is a cause to lifelong success.

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:17.459
And so he began full-time service to Jehovah in January 1939.

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:26.459
And he made it the center of his life. I liked that about him and of course he was handsome, he was the best.

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:33.459
Now Sister Berry, of course, you had this same very demanding schedule, but what were some of the blessings?

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:37.459
The Christian life must be in submission to her husband.

00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:43.459
And when he's busy in theocratic activities, she also has to be flexible.

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:51.459
For example, we were called to the 11th class of Gilead in 1948 and were assigned to Japan.

00:07:52.459 --> 00:08:01.459
During our very first months in Japan, Lloyd and I were assigned to separate congregations in opposite parts of the city of Kobe.

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:08.459
We had so few publishers that we all spread out each going our separate ways to get the territory worked.

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:13.459
When we arrived, there were just three Japanese witnesses in the whole country.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:20.459
Our language was very limited and hardly anyone understood English but Jehovah blessed our efforts.

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:28.459
In fact, one woman I met on my first day preaching, she accepted the truth and served Jehovah faithfully for 50 years as a pioneer.

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:35.460
But in time, more missionaries came to help and about nine years we had 1,000 publishers or so.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.460
In 1975, we were up to 33,000 publishers.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:46.460
But in 1995, over 200,000, that was a rich blessing.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:54.460
A wonderful blessing. Well, Sister Barry, as you look back, is there a memory that you especially treasure?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:00.460
Yes, there is one that touched me very much for the last 24 years of his life.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.460
Lloyd was used extensively for conventions and zone work.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.460
And in that time, we traveled together to some 80 countries.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:15.460
One highlight that especially treasure is that of the District Convention in Cuba in 1998.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:28.460
After each talk, the dear brothers and sisters actually all stood up and gave each speaker standing ovation, clapping their hands vigorously over their heads.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:37.460
Such happiness and gratitude and joy for Jehovah's provisions left a very lasting impression on me and I'll never forget it.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.460
So over the years, we could see how Jehovah blessed us in bulltime service.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.460
And we found much joy in that.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:55.460
So it has been a treasure and a great privilege to have lived alive of nearly 60 years with such a devoted brother and a faithful servant of Jehovah.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:03.460
And another treasure and privilege to continue serving Jehovah in my advanced age, I keep trying with Jehovah's help.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:20.509
I think you're succeeding, Sister Barry. Thank you so much.

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:24.509
Next, we have the privilege to interview Sister Melita Jarris.

00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:31.509
Sister Jarris, we understand that you're from Canada. So please tell us about your early days in the truth there.

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:37.509
Well, I was six years old when my parents learned the truth after they read the booklet, Where Are The Dead?

00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:47.509
Reading that booklet was all that it took my mother and dad to learn the truth about what happened to their first son who had died in the hospital.

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:54.509
And my relatives were fiercely opposed to my parents becoming Jehovah's witnesses.

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:57.509
However, they did not waver.

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:01.509
We left Saskatchewan to go to British Columbia.

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:15.509
And that's when us children read that had the wonderful opportunity to participate in the meetings in English and also go out in the service and comments at the meetings, making comments at the meetings.

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:24.509
But all of a sudden, no meetings and no service. How's the house work? The band came on.

00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:32.509
And we were still young. So immediately announcements were made, we're going to go from door to door.

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:40.509
And they paused and they said, but only with the Bible was us children. That was good for us.

00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:48.509
As young people learned to use the Bible from door to door. And that's when I really was convinced that I wanted to become a pioneer.

00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:57.509
Fascinating. Well, then in 1956, you married brothers, Theodore Jaros. What were some of his outstanding qualities, Mr. Jaros?

00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:04.509
Well, he was 13 when he started to study the Bible and with the family. But the family didn't want to continue. So he did.

00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:14.509
And none of them ever came into the truth of his family. However, he started pioneering the 17 at 20 became a special pioneer.

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:23.509
And at 20, he went to Gilead. It was invited to go to Gilead. And he was in the traveling work when he was 21.

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:37.509
I was hearing a lot about this Ted Jaros. So he had fine reputation. It didn't take me long to appreciate that his goals involved around serving your whole soul. And that was my goal.

00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:46.509
As we got to know each other, I learned that brother Jaros was very dedicated and serious in his devotion to serve Jehovah.

00:12:46.509 --> 00:13:00.509
And first, I appreciated these things. And I found out that he was very serious in his devotion, very kind, friendly. Brothers seemed to be very friendly with him and he with them.

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:08.509
And he became friendly with me. I'd rather appreciate that.

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:12.509
Well, it's just a joke. I was very glad to become his wife.

00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:18.509
Very good. Well, now, you had this very, very busy schedule too. But what were the blessings?

00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:26.509
Well, eight weeks after we were married, we got a brother nor assigned us to the traveling work, starting with the area in Arkansas.

00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:33.509
It was a good thing I was a country girl. I knew what an outhouse was. And we had quite a few of those.

00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:41.509
However, for the next 19 years, we lived with friends in different homes each week, of course.

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:50.509
And it was sometimes little rough, but it was then discomforts weren't that bad.

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:57.509
But we had such wonderful experiences in the ministry that it made up for everything.

00:13:57.509 --> 00:14:05.509
And my husband in 1974 was invited to become a member of the governing body.

00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:12.509
And so we were going to live in Bethel. That was my first home after 19 years, and I love it.

00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:19.509
Of course, my husband had many demanding schedules, but we were always together for morning worship, lunch, and dinner.

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:31.509
And since he was often had to work overtime, I've had much to do as far as my spiritualality at home and as well as duties that I had to perform.

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:37.509
I got busy with my spiritual things, but we were always had time together and I appreciated that.

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:42.509
In fact, 54 and a half years, I'm very grateful for it.

00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:48.509
So, Sister Jarrah's now, as you look back through all those years, what is it that you especially treasure?

00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:54.509
Well, I treasure those 54 and a half years for the reason that we spent together serving our living God.

00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:59.509
It was a blessing to take care of one of Jehovah's sons by being a wife to him.

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:05.509
And of course, it took a power beyond what is normal to see that I met his knees and fulfilled them.

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:12.509
I also treasure that I had the privilege of going to with my husband on many zone visits.

00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:23.509
And to see the joy that it brought him to serve our brothers in many lands, especially in bands under band, like, for instance, Russia, Ukraine,

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:25.509
and Poland.

00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:28.509
Each of these countries was like home to us.

00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:30.509
We were always in a family.

00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:35.509
We just went from the airport to the branch or wherever.

00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:39.509
And we enjoyed having that association together.

00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:43.509
So, these memories bring me much happiness and contentment now.

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:51.509
And I'm grateful to Jehovah for them and thank him that he still gives me the power beyond what is normal to continue to serve here in Bethlehem.

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:54.509
What I can, that I'm assigned to.

00:15:54.509 --> 00:16:08.000
Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Well, next on our program, we have Sister Edith Souter and Sister Souter.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
We'd like to know how you got started in the full-time ministry, please.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Well, I was raised in a truth and my parents always took us to all the meetings and the conventions.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And my father always talked to us about the truth at the supper table and we had to be there.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And as we grew older, we were out in a service every Saturday and Sunday.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000
The service was not easy then because the war was on and mobs would form and they would run us out of town.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
But they never hurt us.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I think they were more afraid than we were.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And at the convention in 1946, pioneering was stress.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And that's when I decided that's what I wanted to do.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So I started pioneering October 1946.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Well, now Sister Souter, we understand it was 1956 when you married by the grant Souter.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Can you tell us about some of his outstanding qualities?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Well, he was very kind, caring person.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And he was very generous, always wanting to help someone in need.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And he began full-time service in 1928.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
He was a very hard worker.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
He was very loyal to Jehovah in his organization.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And he really loved Bethel as I do.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And he never complained and he too, he had a good sense of humor also.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
He very serious about his assignments at Bethel.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Well, now you had this demanding schedule as well as the other sisters.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
What were the blessings that you enjoyed?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Well, we had many blessings. I had many blessings of course.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And I especially enjoyed traveling with my husband to different branches and working the branches with the sisters there.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
See how they hated the work, different in other countries.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And then I, in the ministry, that was a great joy to me to go out in the ministry with some missionaries and see how they did the work.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And I really appreciated the work my husband was doing and was for Jehovah.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And when he was very busy, I would find things to do that I never had time to do.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I never had time to do it any any time because of the busy schedule that he had and I had.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And that kept me very busy too.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
So also we found, but he did find time for me too.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And I really appreciated that.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
That's very touching.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Sister Souter, is there a memory that you particularly treasure?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Oh, yes. I really enjoyed this one.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Grant was scheduled to give a talk at the Cadise prison in Spain where a hundred brothers were incarcerated for their neutrality.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
But the officials said no.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So, but we got there two days early and the brothers said, well, let's try it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So we went into the prison as visitors.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And the brothers have discovered in their workshop an unused door that led into their dormitory.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
It was hidden behind wallpaper.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:31.000
So the brothers decided to camouflage the door completely by covering it with a backless cover.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So you could step into the cover door, open the door behind and enter the dormitory.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And once we were in the prison, we were invited to visit the workshop.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And in this workshop, we stepped into the cupboard and through the door.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And here there were a hundred brothers waiting to see him.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So he was able to give the talk to them.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
They were so excited to have a member of the governing body visit them in prison.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
He was so heartwarming, so exciting.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Well, you know, my life in full-time service has been a very happy one.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Even though there were hardships and there were also challenges.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And I appreciate so much the priorities of serving it, having served the Bethel with my husband.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
And I still love and I'm happy to be at Bethel serving Jehovah.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:38.109
Thank you so much, Sister Serving.

00:20:38.109 --> 00:20:41.109
So now we have the pleasure to get acquainted with Sister Marina Sidlik.

00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:46.109
And Sister Sidlik, would you tell us about how you got started in the full-time service?

00:20:46.109 --> 00:20:50.109
Well, my parents started studying the Bible in the mid-50s.

00:20:50.109 --> 00:20:59.109
And my mom gave my sister and me our first few studies in the Let God Be True Book in the kitchen dining room of our home.

00:20:59.109 --> 00:21:03.109
My first day in field service was when I was 10 years old.

00:21:03.109 --> 00:21:09.109
And from that first day, I still remember the big smile on the face of the anointed brother that was taking us out.

00:21:09.109 --> 00:21:11.109
He was a special pioneer.

00:21:11.109 --> 00:21:17.109
And it soon became evident to me that the happiest people are those in the full-time work.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:21.109
In time, my dad, my sister and I were all baptized.

00:21:21.109 --> 00:21:27.109
And then about 10 years after our first initial contact with the truth,

00:21:27.109 --> 00:21:30.109
Dan Sidlik started visiting our family.

00:21:30.109 --> 00:21:36.109
And it was due to long conversations around our dinner table during his visits

00:21:36.109 --> 00:21:40.109
that my mom saw the beauty of the truth and began making it her own.

00:21:40.109 --> 00:21:44.109
I pioneered in later teenage years without a partner,

00:21:44.109 --> 00:21:50.109
which meant that after a good call there was no one to share the joys with, except Jehovah, of course.

00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:55.109
And so my relationship with Jehovah really blossomed during that time.

00:21:55.109 --> 00:22:02.109
I have some nice memories from London Bethel where I waited through the immigration process to come to the US.

00:22:02.109 --> 00:22:05.109
I sat at Brethren's sister bar's table.

00:22:05.109 --> 00:22:09.109
And my London Bethel roommate, Joey Arrim and I,

00:22:09.109 --> 00:22:11.109
have kept up our friendship to this day.

00:22:11.109 --> 00:22:16.109
We still have a little phone call each Saturday morning before I leave for Field Service.

00:22:16.109 --> 00:22:18.109
It's wonderful.

00:22:18.109 --> 00:22:22.109
Well, we understand now in 1970, who married Brother Daniel Sidlik,

00:22:22.109 --> 00:22:25.109
can you tell us some of his outstanding qualities?

00:22:25.109 --> 00:22:29.109
Well, Dan was known for his genuine love of people,

00:22:29.109 --> 00:22:35.109
his great love of Jehovah and the truth and his innate love of life.

00:22:35.109 --> 00:22:41.109
That combination really gave me a wonderful life to live with him

00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:45.109
and have many memories, of course, from it.

00:22:45.109 --> 00:22:50.109
But some of the memories that treasure our conversations after the supper meal,

00:22:50.109 --> 00:22:54.109
sometimes we'd sit and talk about a Bible topic.

00:22:54.109 --> 00:22:59.109
And it's those spiritual conversations that I missed to this day.

00:22:59.109 --> 00:23:01.109
It's understandable.

00:23:01.109 --> 00:23:04.109
Now, of course, you had a demanding schedule, but there were blessings.

00:23:04.109 --> 00:23:06.109
What were those, Sister Sidlik?

00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:10.109
Yes, the schedule was demanding and for a rather reticent person like myself,

00:23:10.109 --> 00:23:14.109
I found the crowds and the attention overwhelming.

00:23:14.109 --> 00:23:19.109
But the wonderful friendships we made with some brothers and sisters around the world

00:23:19.109 --> 00:23:22.109
are what I treasure to this day.

00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:27.109
Now, when I think of a country like France or Poland or China,

00:23:27.109 --> 00:23:30.109
it's not the topography of the country that comes to mind,

00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:34.109
but the faces of the dear brothers there.

00:23:34.109 --> 00:23:39.109
For example, in Poland, we went there when it was still in Japan,

00:23:39.109 --> 00:23:42.109
and we visited the brothers in their homes.

00:23:42.109 --> 00:23:45.109
But then years later, to go back and see those same brothers

00:23:45.109 --> 00:23:49.109
in their beautiful new branch and assembly halls.

00:23:49.109 --> 00:23:51.109
Well, I was just so happy for them.

00:23:51.109 --> 00:23:53.109
Indeed.

00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:56.109
When I was you look back, Sister Sidlik, at this rich life,

00:23:56.109 --> 00:24:00.109
is there a memory that you particularly treasure that you'd like to share with us?

00:24:00.109 --> 00:24:04.109
Well, this may be an unusual memory to treasure,

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:07.109
but recalling it now may help some other sisters.

00:24:07.109 --> 00:24:09.109
It was when Dan was in hospital,

00:24:09.109 --> 00:24:13.109
one of those many days when I was trying to help him with something.

00:24:13.109 --> 00:24:16.109
And he began grumbling, almost fighting me.

00:24:16.109 --> 00:24:21.109
So I just said, babe, I know this has been terribly hard

00:24:21.109 --> 00:24:25.109
and you've been so brave and you've endured so much already.

00:24:25.109 --> 00:24:28.109
But just please hang in there a bit longer.

00:24:28.109 --> 00:24:31.109
And immediately he softened and he stopped resisting.

00:24:31.109 --> 00:24:33.109
He never resisted me like that again.

00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:37.109
He just needed that word of commendation

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:42.109
and just a little bit of kindness like that,

00:24:42.109 --> 00:24:44.109
approval like that.

00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:47.109
Sisters often give compliments to other sisters

00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:49.109
and receive compliments.

00:24:49.109 --> 00:24:52.109
It's just a little pleasant moment in the day.

00:24:52.109 --> 00:24:55.109
It boils us up. It's a little something we share.

00:24:55.109 --> 00:24:59.109
But that's not the way things work among brothers.

00:24:59.109 --> 00:25:03.109
And it may seem that husbands who give talks and travel

00:25:03.109 --> 00:25:07.109
with the society get enough compliments and praise.

00:25:07.109 --> 00:25:11.109
But that praise is a very limited value to a husband

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:14.109
compared to a word of approval from his wife,

00:25:14.109 --> 00:25:16.109
a word of commendation from his wife.

00:25:16.109 --> 00:25:20.109
And it's just as Paul said about a married man,

00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:23.109
how he's anxious to gain the approval of his wife.

00:25:23.109 --> 00:25:27.109
And so without commendation from a husband,

00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:31.109
a husband is missing a little moment of being void up,

00:25:31.109 --> 00:25:33.109
of being appreciated.

00:25:33.109 --> 00:25:36.109
It's a simple gift a wife can give a husband.

00:25:36.109 --> 00:25:38.109
And as we know from James words,

00:25:38.109 --> 00:25:41.109
every good gift and every perfect present

00:25:41.109 --> 00:25:44.109
comes from above from the Father of Celestial Lights.

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:46.109
Yes, thank you so much, Sister Siddler,

00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.109
for sharing that with us.

00:25:48.109 --> 00:26:19.990
Well, how heartwarming to learn how each of you,

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.990
unselfishly and lovingly supported your husbands

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.990
and Jehovah's service and how richly you were blessed

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.990
for doing so.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.990
Your fine example as faithful Christian women

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.990
is a gift to all of us.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.990
And we thank you so much for sharing your beautiful memories

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.990
with us today.
