00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:09.080
Many in the world highly value a university education and one reason is because it can

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:18.269
qualify them for a desired profession such as a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:24.420
But what does your Gilead training qualify you to do?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.120
To answer that question, let's look at the example of Jesus Christ because isn't it true

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.759
Jesus received extensive training for his important assignment that he would have on the

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:35.759
earth.

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:43.960
And in John 828, he said, just as the father taught me, I speak these things.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.560
Well, certainly the training that Jehovah gave to Jesus prepared him to know what to

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.840
accomplish when he was on earth with his assignment.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.399
And so there was fulfilling scores of prophecies.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.960
There is the selection and training of his disciples of making Jehovah's name and personality

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.439
manifest and of course laying down his life as a sacrifice which would sanctify Jehovah's

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.000
name and provide a way for salvation to man.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.439
But the training Jesus received not only prepared him to know what to do with his assignment

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.120
but also how to carry it out.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.680
And this is really the focus of our talk.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:38.180
Read with me please, our key scripture in the book of Matthew, chapter 20, in verse 28.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.019
This reveals really the attitude, the approach that characterized everything that Jesus did

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:49.219
on earth, Matthew 2028.

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:58.780
This as the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life as

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.540
a ransom in exchange for many.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.019
Jesus came to minister.

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:12.580
His training prepared him to minister to others and that humble approach characterized his

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.780
entire ministry.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.939
It permeated everything that he did on earth.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.099
There are a couple of examples.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:27.860
First he preached and taught others even when he was tired and exhausted.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.860
One example is in the book of John.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.680
I invite you to turn there with me, John chapter 4 in verses 6 and 7.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.800
So Jesus and his disciples are on the way to Galilee and they take this route through

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.759
Samaria and Jesus is there.

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:49.039
They stop at the well and he sends the disciples off to get food and we pick up the account

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.039
John 4.6.

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.680
In fact, Jacob's well was there.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.319
Now Jesus tired out as he was from the journey was sitting at the well.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.400
It was about the sixth hour.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.680
Now interestingly the Bible indicates that this is the only or the study note indicates

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.639
that this is the only place in the scriptures where Jesus is said to be tired out.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.680
Now that's more than just tired.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.520
He was spent, wasn't he?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
But what happens?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.439
Verse 7, a woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.240
What would Jesus do?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.080
Here we see him in the illustration.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.479
Would he take a pass?

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.479
How witness to the next one?

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.159
I am just exhausted.

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.560
No.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.800
He ministered to her.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.240
Please, give me a drink.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.240
He says.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.680
And that we know leads into a wonderful witness that he gave to her.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.080
It leads to them staying there for a couple of days and witnessing to others and many become

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.080
believers in that area.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.840
He ministered to others even when he was tired out.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.960
Now the other account that might come to your mind when you think about Jesus teaching

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.560
others when he was tired is the account in Mark 6.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.560
We won't read it.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.080
But we remember this is when the 12 apostles had just come back from a preaching campaign

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.080
and they're excited but understandably tired.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.599
In fact Mark 631 says that they were so busy, there were so many people coming and going

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.519
that they didn't even have time to eat a meal.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.040
Now interestingly it was also around the same time that Jesus learns about the death

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.279
of John the Baptist.

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:30.399
So understandably he recommends to his disciples, let's go to a lonely place and let's get

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:32.560
a bit of rest.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.319
But what happens?

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.600
The crowd finds out where they're going, runs ahead of them and is waiting for Jesus asking

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.240
for more when they arrive at the other side of the shore.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.360
Well, what would Jesus do?

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.079
He's tired, he's hungry, he's grieving, but he ministers to them.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:55.959
Mark 634 says he started it to teach them many things.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:02.240
The parallel account in Luke 9 says he received them kindly so he truly ministered to them

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.639
even when he was tired.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.959
Here's a second way, we see Jesus ministering to others throughout his ministry.

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:16.279
He kept patiently teaching his disciples.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:21.399
His disciples were a little slow to grasp, some important lessons weren't they?

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:26.680
How often did they argue over which one of them seemed to be the greatest?

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.720
Yet Jesus never gave up on him, he never lost his temper, never raised his voice, never

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.000
be raided them, but instead he kept looking for new ways to teach them this important

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
lesson.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.079
Up until the night before his death, what did he do?

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:43.480
Turn to John 13.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:52.079
Please, John 13 verses 4 and 5 at the evening meal.

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:56.600
He says he got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.879
After taking a towel, he wrapped it around his waist.

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:06.319
After that, he put water into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:11.839
and to dry them off with the towel that was wrapped around him.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:15.519
Here we see in our image Jesus doing this remarkable feat.

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:18.079
The study note says this was the slave's job.

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:22.160
The slave would have normally done this, but here he takes that towel, he wraps the towel

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.519
around him, girds himself essentially, he puts on the slave's apron, doesn't he?

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:31.319
And he washes their feet one after the other.

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.920
He truly ministered to them.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:41.000
And in verse 15, he says, I set the pattern for you that just as I did to you, you should

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.040
also do.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.839
So this is the pattern that they too should minister to others.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:54.839
Now, finally, in a superlative expression of his love, he surrendered his life as a ransom

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.920
for sinful mankind.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.279
And here we see him on the stake, a torturous death of paying that ransom.

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:07.480
Like our theme scripture says, the Son of Man came to minister and to give his life a

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.319
ransom in exchange for many.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:15.680
Could anyone minister in a greater way than that?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.800
Millions, perhaps billions, will inherit everlasting life because of Jesus ministering to

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.009
others in such a self-sacrificing way.

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:28.769
Jesus came to minister.

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:33.810
Jesus training prepared him to minister to others and we see that humble approach of

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:39.189
serving others and everything that he did.

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:42.230
So now we come back to our original question.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.990
What did your Gilead training prepare you to do?

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.589
You know the answer.

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:52.069
It prepared you to be ministers.

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:53.550
So how can you do that?

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:58.149
When you arrive at your assignment, how can you use the things that you learned in Gilead

00:07:58.149 --> 00:07:59.790
to that end?

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.949
When you arrive at your assignment, how can you show the friends that you have come to

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:04.949
minister?

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:09.709
Well, to answer that question, let's first talk to the sisters.

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:15.029
How can you put on your slave's apron and minister to others in your assignments?

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:18.069
We'll consider two ways.

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:21.230
The first way is by your example.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.189
Isn't it true?

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:29.470
We don't often know when someone is observing us or our example is instructing or encouraging

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.670
or helping others.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.309
And yet it is a powerful way to minister to others.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:43.240
Let's look at an example in the book of Mark chapter 12.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.000
Mark chapter 12 and we'll look at this account in verses 41 through 44.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.220
So it's the final week of Jesus' life and he goes to the temple in beginning Mark 12

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.220
41.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.220
He sat down with the treasury chests in view and began observing how the crowd was dropping

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.340
money into the treasury chest and many rich people were dropping in many coins.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:15.139
Now a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins of very little value.

00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:20.340
So he called his disciples to him and said to them, truly I say to you that this poor

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.779
widow put in more than all the others who put money into the treasury chests, for they

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:32.899
all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her want, put in everything she had,

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:36.460
all she had to live on.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.379
The example of that poor widow encouraged Jesus, but also provided a lesson that he could

00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:48.299
use to teach his disciples and then, by including it in God's word, it instructs everyone

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:51.340
who would read the Bible in the future.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.940
But you think about the widow, here we have her in the picture, does she know that the

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.019
son of God was observing her?

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.620
Likely not, we don't know, but often we don't notice that.

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:07.419
Here he was observing her, but this certainly isn't why she did what she did.

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:10.259
She wasn't doing it because well maybe the son of God will see me.

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:15.220
Rather, she was a spiritual person and so she did the right thing for the right reason.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:21.059
In her mind, it was her privilege and her responsibility to contribute toward Jehovah's

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:22.059
work.

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:24.659
And so he did what was right.

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:30.139
Well, the fact was though that Jesus was observing her and he could use her example

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:32.019
to teach others.

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:39.019
Well, similarly, you may not know when your example is being observed by others, but you

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:40.740
are spiritual women.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:46.100
And so you do the right thing for the right reason, whether people observe you or not.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:52.980
But invariably, as you follow this course day by day, day by day, humble ones will observe

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.820
your example and they will benefit from it.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.220
And it may be even a little thing, like even if they just happen to see you stoop down

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.139
and pick up a little trash that fell in the hallway on accident, someone didn't notice

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:08.899
and you stopped to pick it up.

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:14.419
Or maybe when you steer the conversation to the positive, maybe they'll see you take

00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:19.179
an interest in others when they know that you're tired or they see you support your husband

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.340
without complaining.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:26.539
Whatever it may be, the friends might notice these things and benefit from your example.

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:30.379
And it really is a powerful way that you can minister to others.

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:35.210
Here's a second way that you can minister to others.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.730
And this is by your words.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:50.820
Now, speaking of the capable wife, Proverbs 31, in verse 26 says this, Proverbs 31, 26,

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.460
she opens her mouth in wisdom.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:00.779
The law of kindness is on her tongue, isn't that beautiful to think that our speech could

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:04.620
be marked by wisdom and kindness?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:10.419
But the truth is, mature spiritual sisters are known for their kind, insightful advice.

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:15.539
And I think every one of us could cite examples in our life of mature sisters who helped

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:22.019
us along the way with their interest in us and their sharing their insightful words

00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:23.860
of guidance.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.139
And when we think about women like that, we can't help but think about Abigail.

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:35.659
So here she is, humbly on her knees before David, speaking words of wisdom to him.

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:40.980
She's using principles that she gleaned from the law and helped him to see that his actions,

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.379
if he moved forward, would incur blood guilt.

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:49.700
She also tactfully reminded him that Jehovah had anointed him to be the future king of Israel.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.700
So he wouldn't want anything to solely his record or to cause him regret.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:02.179
And even in David's emotionally charged state, her words of wisdom made him stop in his

00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:05.340
tracks and change his course.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:11.460
Well, how can you use words to minister to others like that?

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.659
Well, it's not uncommon in talks like this at Gilead that we're reminded.

00:13:16.659 --> 00:13:20.620
We may not want to quote Gilead all the time that in Gilead we learn this and Gilead we

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.220
learn that and we know that you won't do that.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.980
We understand why.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.940
But the fact is, your Gilead training has deepened your well of good things to share.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:36.179
And so humbly after listening, you may find opportunities where you can share these good

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:38.779
things with others.

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:43.779
And it's often those informal, spontaneous one-on-one conversations where we get an opportunity

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:45.179
to do this.

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:49.700
Maybe they crop up at work or in the hallway on the way home from work or between doors

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:55.379
in the ministry or before and after the meetings at the Kingdom Hall where we can just take

00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:59.860
the time and listen to others, listen to what is on their hearts and mind.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.379
And then we just, not preach to them, we just share Jehovah's thinking on the matter

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:05.860
at hand.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.460
And that has a tremendous impact.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.740
And we truly love you, sisters, for your kindness and your spiritual insight.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:20.299
It really is a beautiful way that you can minister to others.

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:26.220
So those are two ways our sisters can minister to others by your example and by your words.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.299
Now what about you, brothers?

00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:33.860
How can you put on your slave's apron and minister to others in your assignment?

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.460
Well, certainly all the things that we said to the sisters would apply to you as well.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.860
You can minister to others by your example and your words as well.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.700
But Jehovah has also determined to use the brothers in positions of oversight to take

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.220
the lead in his organization.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:54.820
So when you arrive to your assignment, likely you will have some responsibility or oversight

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.940
in your work.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:05.659
But as Jesus example taught us, those in authority should also be ministers.

00:15:05.659 --> 00:15:10.419
So how can you use your Gilead training then to minister to others the way you carry

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.100
out your assignment?

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.220
Here are two ways.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:21.779
The first way, approach your assignment as a shepherd.

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:24.179
Approach your assignment as a shepherd.

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:30.220
David set a fine example in this way because David, as a young shepherd boy in the field,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.340
learned many things that would become very useful to him later in life and in his service

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.340
to Jehovah.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.700
He learned how to play the harp.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.980
He learned how to use the sling.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.860
He learned how to live outdoors.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:46.259
But notice how his time as a shepherd affected his approach to the kingship.

00:15:46.259 --> 00:15:49.100
Terminate me, please, to the book of Psalms.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:58.470
And let's read Psalm 78 verses 70 through 72.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.789
Psalm 78, 70 through 72.

00:16:02.789 --> 00:16:09.029
He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pins, from tending the nursing

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.389
use.

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:18.029
He made him the shepherd over Jacob, his people, and over Israel, his inheritance.

00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:25.429
He shepherded them with integrity of heart and with skillful hands, he led them.

00:16:25.429 --> 00:16:27.950
So in time, David did become king, didn't he?

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.389
He was given theocratic authority over all of the people of Israel.

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:35.350
But he didn't approach that assignment as a dictator.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:41.509
He never lorded it over the people of Israel, rather he approached it as a shepherd.

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:48.990
And he viewed those precious sheep as just that sheep who needed to be fed and protected

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.389
and cared for.

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:52.710
And it characterized his kingship, didn't it?

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:58.629
The verse says that he shepherded with integrity of heart and with skillful hands.

00:16:58.629 --> 00:17:03.389
He truly ministered to them.

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:11.910
Just like David, minister to those whom you oversee, approach your assignment as a shepherd.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:18.190
And when they sense that you are truly concerned about their well-being, about their workload,

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:22.829
about their training, when they see you often because you get out of your office and you

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:29.150
visit them regularly and you shepherd them, then they will feel secure.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.430
They will know that they have an overseer who loves them and is watching out for them

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.789
and they will find joy in their assignment.

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:42.470
And they'll even be able to endure a difficult work situation for a time because they know

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.950
they have a way out.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:49.269
They know they have an overseer who is aware of their situation and is doing what he can

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:50.269
to assist them.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:57.240
Here's a second way that you can minister to those whom you oversee.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.039
And that is by showing honor and respect for them.

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:09.069
Termeth me please to the book of Romans chapter 12.

00:18:09.069 --> 00:18:11.509
Romans 12 and let's read verse 10.

00:18:11.509 --> 00:18:21.559
Romans 12, 10, and brotherly love have tender affection for one another in showing honor

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:25.319
to one another take the lead.

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:30.000
Certainly overseers should take the lead in showing honor to others.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.079
Not truly every servant of Jehovah deserves honor, isn't that true and why?

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:39.319
It's because they were created in Jehovah God's image.

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:43.000
Each one is in a dedicated relationship with him.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
They are praying to Jehovah Jehovah is listening to their prayers and answering their prayers.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.240
And also the sheep belong to Jehovah, don't they?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.839
Purchase with the precious blood of his only begotten son.

00:18:56.839 --> 00:19:01.599
And in Bethel we have an added reason to give them honor because each one has received

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.519
his or her assignment from Jehovah.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:09.119
The friends in our department, this is their sacred service, this is their assignment

00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:12.119
given to them from Jehovah and they know it well.

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:17.400
And so each one deserves respect and honor.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:23.400
Well how will they sense that we truly honor them from the heart?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:31.559
They will sense it when we take note of their work and commend them frequently and sincerely.

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:36.559
They'll sense it when we follow through on their requests promptly.

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:40.880
And they'll sense it when we listen to their suggestions to improve the work.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.079
And when they do that, if they should suggest an improvement, it doesn't mean that they

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:49.200
are challenging our authority, it doesn't mean that they're being presumptuous, it doesn't

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.000
mean that we were doing it wrong before.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.039
Even Jehovah invited suggestions from his angels in the case of Ahab, didn't he?

00:19:57.039 --> 00:20:00.480
And he approved one of their suggestions.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:06.000
Well in these and other ways we can show honor to our workmates.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.900
We show them that we have come to minister.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:16.940
So what does your Gilead training qualify you, prepare you to do?

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.180
It prepares you to minister to others.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:26.259
To what characterized Jesus ministry, may it characterize your service as well.

00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:31.579
And as we learn sisters can do that through your example and your words, brothers can do

00:20:31.579 --> 00:20:38.299
that in addition to that by approaching your assignment as a shepherd and also by truly

00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:43.500
taking the lead in showing honor and respect to others.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.220
There's no doubt that Jesus was eager to show Jehovah that He benefited from the fine

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:51.180
training that He received from Him.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:57.299
And so not only did He do what Jehovah asked Him to do, He carried it out in the way that

00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:59.539
Jehovah wanted Him to carry it out.

00:20:59.539 --> 00:21:07.059
Well we know that you too are eager to apply the good things that you learn in Gilead.

00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:11.099
And so as you begin to think about maybe some of the things that you will do differently

00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:17.140
when you arrive at your assignment, give close attention to how you will carry out your

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.779
work, show that you have come to minister.

00:21:21.779 --> 00:21:27.299
And when you do that, you will show that you truly benefited from your Gilead training.

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:32.500
The brothers will love you and above all you will have the favor and approval of our

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.740
God, Jehovah.
