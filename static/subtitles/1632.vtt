00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:14.869
The Writing Committee of the Governing Body continues to take the lead in

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:20.670
producing Bible-based publications. This includes translation of the Bible into

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.710
more languages, continued work on the online study Bible, and improvements to

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.750
magazines, including both the public and study editions of the Watchtower. Such

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.350
adjustments not only help us to accomplish our commission to preach more fully,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:46.869
but also allow us to make better use of donated funds. In 2016 and 2017, the

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:52.549
New World Translation was released in 30 additional languages. Also, translations

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:58.070
or revisions are currently underway in well over 100 languages. In many of those

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.909
languages, Bibles are not available, very expensive, or difficult to obtain. The

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.430
goal of the revised New World Translation is to use easy to understand modern

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.230
language that encourages reading. In some languages, Bibles use words that are

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.230
found only in religious or archaic literature. However, those words are not used

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.269
by people in everyday life. For example, Thai and Burmese Bibles provided by

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:33.950
Christendom use a formal, honorific language. Those Bibles use forms of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.670
address for God that would be used when speaking to a king, but since no one

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.230
speaks that way in everyday conversation, many of the words are not understood

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.189
by the general public. Also, it is difficult to view Jehovah as a loving father

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.109
when one would never speak to his own father in this way. However, now that the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.989
brothers have the New World Translation in everyday language, many readers have

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:06.030
reported that they feel closer to Jehovah. Another blessing we have

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.069
recently received is the online study Bible. Although not yet available in many

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.550
languages, this provision is already the most research publication our

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.909
organization has ever produced. While we use our regular Bible in the preaching

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:26.509
work, the study Bible is designed for personal study. Among other features, the

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:35.509
study Bible contains a media gallery with new artwork, 3D models, videos, and photos.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:41.909
This requires a considerable amount of effort to produce. Many of the

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.150
photographs and videos are from Bible lands. At times, archaeological sites

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.389
include numerous layers from different time periods. Researchers must then

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.310
determine which ruins are from the specific era being considered. There are

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.030
other challenges as well. Many historical sites are located in areas with strict

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.189
governmental travel restrictions, including no fly zones. To get aerial views

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.909
using a drone, the brothers must obtain special authorization from the

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:23.770
authorities. Since January 2018, the public editions of the Watchtower and

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.569
Awake were adjusted so that instead of each covering multiple subjects, they

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.409
now cover just one subject per issue. This gives us the opportunity to focus on

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.610
specific topics that are of the most interest and benefit to the public. The

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.289
magazines are also designed to be offered in the ministry for many months, rather

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:53.569
than just a few weeks after their release date. There will also be many new and

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.129
exciting improvements made to the study edition of the Watchtower. Starting in

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:04.210
2019, it will have a new design and layout. Each study article will be

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.889
numbered to correspond to the 52 weeks of the calendar year. Also, a somewhat

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.449
larger font will be used. Many of the brothers and sisters who use the paper

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:19.370
copy of the magazine live in locations with poor lighting conditions. With a

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.050
larger font, the magazine will be easier for them to read. The new design will

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.730
also occasionally include a picture description that explains the content of

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.769
an image. This will be of great help in the Braille field. Additionally, the

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:40.050
song numbers for the Watchtower study will include the title of the song. The

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.009
opening song of the study will appear at the beginning of the article and the

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.329
concluding song at the end of the article. Similarly, the review questions will

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:55.449
appear at the end of the article rather than the beginning. As these adjustments

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.889
are implemented, the English-simplified edition of the Watchtower will be

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:07.250
discontinued in 2019. Instead, the regular study edition will use simpler

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.769
language. This cuts in half the print design, layout, and composition work that

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:21.810
is involved. Jehovah is truly speeding up the work, enabling us to focus on what

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.089
really matters in this time of the end, helping others to learn the truth about

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.410
our loving Heavenly Father.
