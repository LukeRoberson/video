00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.910
Everyone gets sad now and then.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.260
To you, in some cases, you may know the cause.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.869
In other cases, you may not.

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:35.869
Even if there doesn't seem to be a cause,

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.869
what can you do when sadness holds you in its grip?

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:41.869
First, find someone to talk to about it,

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:46.219
such as a parent or close friend.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.219
In the midst of his turmoil,

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.219
Joe, a faithful man in Bible time, said,

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.219
I will speak out in my bitter distress.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.219
When someone knows what you're going through,

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.219
he or she can lower the rope and pull you out of the pit.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.230
Here's another idea.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.340
Why not put your thoughts on paper?

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.340
At Proverbs 321, the Bible tells us to safeguard practical wisdom

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340
and thinking ability.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.310
Writing about your feelings can help you do that.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.310
Once they're on paper, you can sort them out.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.000
And then the sadness can be less overpowering.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.750
A third suggestion.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.750
The Bible says that if you pray about your concerns,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
the peace of God that surpasses all understanding

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.290
will guard your hearts and thoughts.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.290
So don't forget prayer.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.290
Last, but certainly not least,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.290
reading the Bible can help, especially the Book of Psalms.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.290
Feeling your mind with positive thoughts

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.290
from the Bible can have a positive effect on your feelings.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.289
But what if your feelings just won't go away?

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.289
What if you've lost interest in just about all activities

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.289
that you used to find exciting?

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.289
What if you seem to have no appetite?

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.289
Have trouble sleeping?

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:27.289
And suffer from intense feelings of hopelessness.

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:31.289
If symptoms persist, why not talk to your parents

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.289
about getting a checkup?

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:38.289
A physician can help determine if your sadness has a medical cause,

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.289
such as clinical depression.

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.289
If you do suffer from clinical depression,

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.289
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.289
With treatment, many sufferers have begun to feel better.

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.289
Perhaps even the best they have felt in a long time.

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:59.289
So whether your sadness is caused by depression or not,

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:01.289
with assistance and effort,

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.289
you can get out of the deep pit of sadness.

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:11.969
Remember, feelings are temporary.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.969
They will pass.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.969
And if you can learn to deal with them now,

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.969
you'll be prepared to handle them as an adult.

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.969
By taking things a day at a time,

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.969
and relying on the support of your parents and trustworthy friends,

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.969
you can go from sad to glad.
