00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:15.189
And in production to 3 John, John wrote his third letter in or near Ephesus about 98 CE.

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:21.190
John addressed his third letter to a beloved Gaeus, a common Roman name at the time.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.500
3 John has 14 verses.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Gaeus had a fine reputation for enduring in the truth and for welcoming brothers who were strangers to him.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.500
And the Apostle John commends him for his hospitable spirit.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Diatrophes attitude contrast sharply with that of Gaeus.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Diatrophes is disrespectful of apostolic authority and what's the first place among the brothers.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.500
Diatrophes refuses to welcome visiting brothers.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.500
He even tries to hinder and expel from the congregation those who show hospitality.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.500
However, Demetrius, a Christian and dear friend of John, is spoken of favorably.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Demetrius may have been the one who delivered John's third letter.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.500
Did you know?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:32.500
At 3 John 6, Gaeus is advised to send the traveling brothers on their way in a manner worthy of God.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.500
This would mean carefully supplying the brothers with what they need for their trip.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.500
Gaeus evidently did this.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:53.500
At the end of his second and third letters, John explains that his letters are short because he hopes to see his brothers soon and speak with them face to face.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.500
As you read 3 John, note how it stresses the importance of Christian hospitality.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.500
See how it contrasts the attitude of proud Diatrophes with that of beloved Gaeus.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.500
And observe how the depth of John's love is expressed for his fellow kingdom heirs.
