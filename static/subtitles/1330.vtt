00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:33.799
As we enter Kyrgyzstan, one of the seven countries on the Eurasian continent with Stan at the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:41.240
end of its name, you'll find many hospitable and open-hearted local residents.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.920
Many people raise livestock, and so they will understand the words of David that are

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.039
recorded in the 23rd psalm.

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:59.640
The truth about the caring shepherd, Jehovah, reached this region in the 1950s.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.959
More than 20 years ago, Jehovah's Witnesses gave literature in the Russian language to

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.750
one Kyrgyz woman.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.950
Her small daughter, who stood nearby, said, Mommy, please teach me Russian, since God

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.500
talks to people in Russian.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.620
Today Bible-based publications are also translated into the Kyrgyz language, and the great

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:36.379
shepherd, Jehovah, leads many to grassy pastures.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:42.500
Jehovah uses the branch office in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, to refresh his people

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.099
throughout the whole country and lead them in the path of righteousness.

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:53.579
Fellow believers arrived from different countries to help the local brothers with the reconstruction

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.180
of the branch.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.859
All worked hand in hand to accomplish a tremendous amount of work.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.140
The brothers and sisters, who wholeheartedly supported the project, was strengthened and

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.780
encouraged very much.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.500
We were apprehensive of coming at first, but we have enjoyed ourselves thoroughly on construction.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.060
I thought that this is such a great privilege for us to give all of your strength, everything

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.740
to Jehovah, and to feel that you didn't waste your youth, and this is so important.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.300
I was touched by the fact that brothers that came from different countries, and were

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.740
of different nationalities, worked together in unity.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.620
It's yet another proof that this is Jehovah's organization.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.979
This project really strengthens my faith.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:54.780
Jehovah always gives us more than we could ever need or ever want.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.020
For me, those days were the best time in my life.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.419
I would never trade those days for anything.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:10.180
The participation in the reconstruction was a real gift from Jehovah, and Jehovah really

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.419
knows how to give good gifts.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.340
I am grateful to him for this.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.780
While construction work was coming to its conclusion, preparation for the branch dedication began.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.300
It was to take place on October 24, 2015.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:38.460
Brothers built the Yurt on the branch property several days before the dedication program.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.699
Finally, the long-awaited day arrived.

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:49.180
The many guests that came from faraway countries were invited into the Yurt and could try the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.939
local cuisine.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:58.099
In one of the talks at the program, the speaker compared the branch office to a Yurt.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.379
Shepherds caring for their flocks in the mountains leaving Yurt nearby.

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.669
They are able to hear the sound of their flock from inside the Yurt.

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:19.420
If something happens, the shepherd can immediately step in to help the sheep.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:26.019
Similarly, the branch office listens to the sheep in the field and renders needed assistance.

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:33.629
Therefore, the publishers fear no harm.

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:40.069
The Stephen lead, a member of the governing body, came for the special dedication program.

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:45.269
This program and another special meeting held the following day were streamed to meeting

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:52.069
places throughout the whole country, with a total attendance of over 6,000.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:05:00.699
Many listeners were touched, and their eyes were filled with tears of joy.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.699
Now there are more than 5,000 active witnesses in Kyrgyzstan, a country with a population

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.860
of over 6,000,000.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.980
They continue to search for honest-hearted people that are thirsty for the truth.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.699
Yes, our great shepherd, Jehovah, prepares a reach table and fills the cup until it is

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.319
well-filled.

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:32.959
The Prophet David saying, surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me all the days of

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:39.680
my life, and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah for all my days.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.600
Jehovah servants in Kyrgyzstan want to serve Jehovah, together with their brothers and sisters

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.160
Earthwide, now and forever.
