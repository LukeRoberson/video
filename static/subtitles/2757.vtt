00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.950
You and I make a lot of decisions every day.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.589
Now, some have a little impact on our lives,

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.390
others have a very big impact.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.230
And we can appreciate that we can make choices

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.630
and decisions for ourselves.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.269
Think of how life would be if you made no decisions for yourself.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.309
Someone tells you when to go to bed.

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:23.750
They pick out your clothes,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.750
and they tell you what to do for work.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.149
Well, none of us would like that.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.550
Jehovah gave each of us free will,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.350
and that's the precious gift of making choices for ourselves.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.630
Now, if you ever thought about why Jehovah gave us this gift,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.350
I mean, why trust us with free will

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.549
when he knew that we could make bad choices or decisions?

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.590
A one-powerful reason is love.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.509
The only way to give us the gift of love

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:55.549
is also to give us the gift of free will.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.549
The two are tied together.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.630
You really can't have one without the other.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.269
For example, if I program my computer,

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.790
they give me a message every day at 2 p.m.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.790
John, I love you.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.950
I think you're a wonderful guy.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.349
I think there'd be a little something wrong with me

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:14.469
if I thought, oh, isn't that nice.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.230
My computer, it loves me.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.670
Yeah, love only exists if it comes

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.750
truly from a free will expression.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.750
Now, did Jehovah place any boundaries on free will?

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.750
Yes, they were stated in the law to the nation of Israel.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.750
And Jesus later repeated them at Matthew chapter 22

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
verses 37 through 40.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.219
He said to him,

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.219
This is the greatest and first commandment.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.219
The second, like it is this,

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.219
you must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.219
On these two commandments,

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.219
the whole law hangs and the prophets.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.219
So our use of free will has love of God

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.219
and love of neighbor as its boundaries.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.219
I mean, notice, for example,

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.219
what people are doing in this picture,

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.219
both inside the circle,

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.219
boundary and outside.

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.219
See, free will allows us to do any of the things

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.219
we see in the picture.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.219
But love of God and love of neighbor

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.219
move us to reject what's outside the circle

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.219
and choose to do the kinds of things

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.219
that we see inside the circle.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.219
Now, to stay within those boundaries,

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.219
Jehovah gave us a marvelous brain

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.219
and a built-in conscience,

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.219
but he also knows we need more help.

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.219
And that's why he also gave us Bible principles.

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.219
Basic truths from the Bible

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.219
that can help us to make good decisions.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.219
And it can safely be said that any decision we face

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.219
can be guided by Bible principles.

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.219
Now, our creator, Jehovah, knows what's best for us.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.219
And he also trusts us to make decisions

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.219
based on Bible principles.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.219
Because he knows that when we do that,

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.219
then we're really truly going to be happy, content,

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
and at peace with him and with others.

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.219
So in review so far,

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.219
Jehovah gave us free will.

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.219
That's the privilege to make choices for ourselves.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.219
And he also gave us Bible principles

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.219
as the boundaries to our choices.

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:38.219
But making difficult decisions

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.219
requires that we train ourselves

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.219
to recognize Bible principles and apply them.

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:49.219
Now, let's read Romans chapter 12 and verse 1.

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.219
And let's see how this verse describes

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.219
the decision making a process.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.219
Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassion of God-brothers

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.219
to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:06.219
wholly and acceptable to God,

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:12.219
a sacred service with your power of reason.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.220
So, are we using our power of reason

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.220
to understand Bible principles?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.220
For example, young children ask lots of questions.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.220
But as a child ever asked you,

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.220
what happens when I drop a ball?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.220
A pencil?

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.220
A book?

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.220
No, they don't ask that.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.220
They know what happens to anything they drop.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.220
It falls down.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.220
See, the child doesn't need rules for every object

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.220
that has quickly grasped the principle.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.220
Anything he drops falls down.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.220
Now, what if an 18-year-old asks you,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.220
what's going to happen when I drop this pen?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.220
Well, it's obvious he's not been paying attention

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.220
to basic principles of life.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.220
So, by us paying attention to Bible principles,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.220
we can very quickly see the pattern of love of God

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.220
and love of neighbor.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.220
And know the right thing to do

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.220
without a long list of rules for every situation.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.600
Well, how can we train our power of reason?

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.600
We train it by paying attention

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.600
as we read and study the Bible.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.600
Now, we don't need rules for which movies to watch,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.600
which songs to listen to,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600
or what clothes we can wear.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.600
If we're paying attention when we're reading the Bible,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.600
we train our conscience with Bible principles

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.600
so we can make such decisions

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.600
without needing a long list of rules.
