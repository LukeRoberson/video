00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:10.869
Welcome! Here's a preview of what we'll discover in this month's program. Have

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.509
you ever wanted to turn back time and undo something you wish you hadn't done?

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.429
In this month's My Teen Life, we'll hear how T'Lilla and Jose, who would help

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:28.750
from their parents and Jehovah, made progress after a setback. If we've

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.950
strayed far from Jehovah, our own heart may make us feel like we could never

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.270
come back. This month's music video will remind us how great Jehovah's love is

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.509
for those who want to return to help. If a brother once served as an elder but is

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:51.710
not presently, what can help him to regain his privileges? We'll hear the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.149
experiences of two brothers in a segment with this thought-provoking title,

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.590
return and serve again. There's much to look forward to and this March 2023

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:28.299
edition of J.W. Broadcasting. Have you ever set a goal for yourself that was

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.900
harder to reach than your first thought? How did that make you feel? And this

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.739
dramatization, note the adjustments a sister makes to work toward her goal.

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:52.180
How is Charable? I could have answered that better. No, you did great, really.

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:01.099
I've always been hard on myself. We need strength in our faith. Then have we, um,

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:16.780
um, no, that's all. Sometimes it made me so anxious that even the normal stuff I do

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:37.180
felt impossible. So what do you think brings this out? I don't know maybe,

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:47.219
maybe lately it's because I'm thinking about Escai. If I can reach that goal, it'll be fine.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:59.080
I see. How about we read a scripture that might help? They didn't discourage me from Escai,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:10.150
but they suggested I tried to manage the anxiety first. I always on it. If I focused in my

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:35.939
goal and took care of myself, I'll get there. Maybe it was a little too much focus.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:04:01.530
Thank you, brothers. So in the right, Escai would be a lot for me right now.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:13.340
Sorry. But you get there. I tried everything to fix this. What's wrong with me?

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:23.939
Nothing. Something's just take time. Hey, I have Lily studied tomorrow morning.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:39.769
I could use your help. I want to get baptized. But I don't know. You all do so much.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:57.459
I don't think I could ever really be. I think I understand. Can I show you something?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:11.990
Micah 68, what do you read that? He has told you, oh man, what is good and what is Jehovah requiring of you

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:18.470
only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty and to walk in modesty with your God.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:27.029
That last part, walk in modesty. That's about knowing our limitations.

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:35.829
So, is Jehovah happy with what you can do or does he want what you can to do?

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:44.870
He only expects what I can do. Then why should we expect more?

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:49.750
Turns out, I gave Lily the same advice that brothers gave me.

00:05:51.189 --> 00:06:00.329
It was my turn to apply it. I had to be honest with myself. My limitation was my own high

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:09.689
expectations. I've been doing it so long that there was no quick fix. It didn't mean giving up on my

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:22.860
goals though. I just tried to focus more on what I could do in the present, like having more empathy

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:36.120
for people who feel like I do and showing them how much Jehovah values them. We could tell about

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:42.839
the student how we overcame a challenge.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:52.329
True this, I can actually do a lot for Jehovah with the reasonable expectations.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.160
Our sister learned to manage her anxiety in part by managing her expectations,

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:11.720
a crucial step to giving her best to Jehovah. That lesson is an excellent introduction to this

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:21.980
month's theme, realistic expectations, the key to joyful and successful service. When you hear

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:30.779
the word realistic, what comes to your mind? Realistic conveys the idea of something that is practical,

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:39.420
rational, reasonable, and sensible. Having expectations that are realistic is essential to

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:49.420
joy and success in Jehovah's service. In contrast, unrealistic expectations cause discouragement

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:59.420
as Proverbs 13-12 says, expectation postponed makes the heart sick, but a desire realized is a

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:07.420
tree of life. Appropriately, we often use this verse when referring to expectations that are not

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:16.620
achieved as quickly as we would like. However, expectations that are too high can also make our

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:27.259
heart sick. Notice this quote from the August 8, 1983 issue of a wake. Disappointment is often

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:35.500
not so much a matter of expectation postponed, as expectations too high. Now at times it is good to

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:43.820
have high goals to aim for the stars, but always expecting to come out on top is a surefire way

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:53.179
to beckon disappointment. To avoid disappointment, our expectation should be reasonable and sensible.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:01.259
In our discussion, we're going to answer the following three questions about our expectations.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:08.779
Number one, why must we be realistic about what we expect from ourselves?

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:16.059
Number two, why must we be realistic and what we expect from our brothers and sisters?

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:25.820
And number three, why is it realistic to expect that Jehovah will reward us for our faithful sacred

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:34.919
service? Our first question is, why must we be realistic about what we expect from ourselves?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:43.159
Of course, we love Jehovah with our whole heart, mind and soul, and we want to do everything for

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:51.720
his glory. However, the reality is that no matter how much we love Jehovah and want to obey him,

00:09:52.279 --> 00:10:00.679
we are sinful descendants of Adam. As a result, we occasionally transgress and thought word

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:10.039
indeed. Ecclesiastes 7.20 states, for there is no righteous man on earth who always does good

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:19.799
and never sins. And James 3.2 reads, for we all stumble many times. If anyone does not stumble in

00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:27.720
word, he is a perfect man. Perhaps you can relate to the feelings of the Apostle Paul at Romans chapter

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:38.600
7, verses 18-20. For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, there dwells nothing good,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.759
where I have the desire to do what is fine, but not the ability to carry it out.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:53.000
For I do not do the good that I wish, but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice.

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:59.879
If then, I do what I do not wish, I am no longer the one carrying it out,

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:08.360
but it is the sin dwelling in me. Paul struggled with his sinful flesh, made him feel miserable.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:18.039
At times, we too might feel dejected, disappointed, and frustrated over our shortcomings.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:27.559
We may begin to feel like a failure. What enabled Paul to continue serving Jehovah with joy and zeal?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:35.240
He honestly acknowledged his sinful condition and had complete confidence in the ransom sacrifice

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:41.639
of Jesus Christ. Paul went on to say at Romans 7, 24 and 25,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.919
miserable man that I am. Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:58.840
Thanks to God through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Yes, through Jehovah's undeserved kindness and his

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:05.240
loving provision of the ransom, we can confidently remain in Jehovah's love and render worship

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:14.200
that is acceptable to him, even in our imperfect state. How powerful is the ransom in allowing us

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:22.039
to have a clean conscience and retain Jehovah's approval? Acts chapter 3 verse 19 answers this

00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:29.639
question. Repet therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:37.320
so that seasons of refreshing may come from Jehovah himself. The original language word translated

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:44.919
blotted out means to cause to disappear by wiping, to remove so as to leave no trace.

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:49.320
Jehovah completely wipes out our sin.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:58.120
Till a straight. Imagine a white riding surface representing our clean standing before Jehovah.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:06.360
Now, imagine that red dots are drawn on it representing our sins. We should not view the ransom as

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:13.720
if Jehovah draws an X over each dot to cross them out. Those red dots would still be visible.

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:22.039
Rather, we should imagine Jehovah based on the ransom completely erasing the red dots

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:29.639
so that a clean white riding surface is restored. Jehovah further reassures us of the completeness

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:35.879
of his forgiveness with the words recorded at Psalm 103 verses 12 through 14.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:45.080
Jehovah remembers that we are dust and does not expect perfection from us.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:53.559
As a merciful Father, he puts our sins as far off as the sunrise is from the sunset.

00:13:55.639 --> 00:14:03.480
Even if a servant of Jehovah commits a serious sin, if he is truly repentant with godly sadness,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:15.080
his sin can be blotted out completely forgiven. Therefore, it is essential for us to maintain a

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:23.480
reasonable, sensible, realistic view of our imperfect state. We're going to make mistakes,

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:31.000
but we must have full trust in the reality of Jehovah's forgiveness based on the ransom.

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:39.159
Also, we can learn valuable lessons from our errors so that we'll be less likely to repeat them.

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:48.539
We need patience, though, because some personality flaws and bad habits may not go away overnight.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:59.580
Some of them may even be a lifelong battle. At times, we may need counsel and discipline.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:04.299
What should we realistically expect when receiving discipline?

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:13.019
Hebrews 12, 11 through 13, makes it clear that initially it will not be joyous.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:21.899
It is painful. However, when we humbly accept discipline and apply the counsel,

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.139
we can be sure that we will gain inner peace and be a better servant of Jehovah.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:34.860
Therefore, do not give up, but keep making progress.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.539
Never allow the devil to convince you that you are a failure.

00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:47.820
As stated in the September 1, 2001 issue of the Watchtower on page 18,

00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:55.610
Satan would like nothing better than to rob you of your peace. He would surely like you to feel

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.929
that your imperfection makes your service unacceptable to God.

00:16:01.049 --> 00:16:08.330
Never allow the devil to demoralize you. Our second question for consideration is,

00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:14.250
why must we be realistic and what we expect from our brothers and sisters?

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:21.769
Just as it's essential to avoid having expectations that are too high for ourselves,

00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:26.889
we must also avoid expecting too much from our brothers and sisters.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:34.809
Such unreasonable expectations create stress, disappointment, and frustration.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:42.009
The awake of September 8, 1994 quoted a factory supervisor who said,

00:16:43.929 --> 00:16:49.450
you have to accept people as they are. If you expect more than they can give,

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:55.049
you will elevate the stress level, making everyone unhappy.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.480
We should expect from our fellow workers what Jehovah and Jesus expect from them.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:11.559
Jesus' illustration of the talents recorded in Matthew chapter 25 conveys their thinking.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:20.759
The main point of this illustration is that the master Jesus expects each of his anointed brothers,

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:25.640
the slaves, and by extension those who are of the other sheep,

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:31.799
to do his or her best in the assigned work of preaching the good news.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:40.279
How did Jesus distribute the work? Matthew chapter 25 verse 15 provides the answer.

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:49.480
He gave five talents to one, two to another, and one to still another,

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.160
to each according to his own ability, and he went abroad.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:03.480
Jehovah and Jesus are pleased with, and will reward each of us when we do our best within

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:09.720
our circumstances and ability. When the slave of two talents gained two more,

00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:16.440
the master did not say to him, why did you not gain five more like your fellow slave?

00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:25.640
He gave the two talent slave the same commendation as the one who was given the five and gained five more.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:36.039
Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:45.079
many things. Enter into the joy of your master. As a result, the two talent slave could be just

00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:53.720
as successful and joyful as the five talents lay. They both met their master's reasonable

00:18:53.720 --> 00:19:01.160
expectations, and their master was joyful too. What a fine lesson for all of us,

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:09.880
including those serving as elders. In imitation of Jehovah and Jesus, we should never put pressure

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:16.599
on our brothers to do more than they're capable of doing. Failure to take this reasonable and

00:19:16.599 --> 00:19:25.880
realistic approach can result in much frustration. Another way that we show we have reasonable

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:33.400
expectations is to acknowledge that from time to time disagreements and hurt feelings will arise

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:40.839
among our brothers. Have you ever heard someone say, I expect to be treated that way by the world,

00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:47.240
but not by my brother? Is it reasonable to expect that there will not be any difficulties

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:54.759
among brothers? No. Does Jesus expect that at times his disciples will have difficulties

00:19:54.759 --> 00:20:04.839
among themselves? Yes. Why can we say this? Remember some of the expressions Jesus used throughout

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:12.380
the sermon on the mount. Happy are the peacemakers since they will be called sons of God.

00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:19.660
If you're bringing your gift to the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:28.619
against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar and go away. First, make your peace with

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:38.779
your brother and then come back and offer your gift. Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:49.099
our debtors. Stop judging that you may not be judged. These verses show that Jesus knew his

00:20:49.099 --> 00:20:57.819
disciples would have challenges among themselves. That was a realistic expectation, but it's also

00:20:57.819 --> 00:21:03.900
reasonable to conclude that these problems can be successfully resolved if godly principles

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:12.220
are applied. Then peace can be restored. Additionally, we should expect some tensions to arise

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:20.140
among the brotherhood today. But by applying Bible principles, peace can be restored and maintained.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:29.500
We'll now consider our third question. Why is it realistic to expect that Jehovah will reward

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:37.420
us for our faithful sacred service? At Hebrews 116, the Bible tells us that Jehovah is the

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:47.019
rewarder of those earnestly seeking him. And at 1 Corinthians 1558, the Apostle Paul encourages us to

00:21:47.019 --> 00:21:57.420
have plenty to do in the work of the Lord knowing that your labor is not in vain. Paul was absolutely

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:04.539
sure of his heavenly reward. Despite his sins prior to becoming a Christian and his battles with

00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:13.180
sinful inclinations, please note his confidence expressed at 2 Timothy chapter 4 verses 7 and 8.

00:22:14.859 --> 00:22:22.059
I have fought the fine fight. I have run the race to the finish. I have observed the faith.

00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:29.339
From this time on, there is reserve for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the

00:22:29.339 --> 00:22:37.420
righteous judge, will give me as a reward in that day, yet not to me only, but also to all those

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:44.539
who have loved his manifestation. We can have similar confidence and the reward Jehovah has promised.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:51.660
Whether our hope is heavenly or to enjoy everlasting life on a paradise earth,

00:22:53.259 --> 00:22:59.900
this is a realistic expectation because our reasonable and loving God has promised it,

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:10.299
and he does not lie. Therefore, may we develop and maintain realistic expectations for ourselves

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:19.099
and for our fellow workers. May we never lose sight of the reality that Jehovah will reward those

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:27.579
earnestly seeking Him. If we have realistic expectations, we can find joy and success in our

00:23:27.579 --> 00:23:41.019
service to Jehovah now, as well as have the prospect of doing so forever, young ones. No doubt you

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:48.619
have many expectations for the life that lays ahead of you. Be assured that Jehovah wants the best

00:23:48.619 --> 00:23:54.940
for you and will give you Holy Spirit and the direction you need to make good choices.

00:23:57.019 --> 00:24:04.220
But what can you do if you make a decision that in the end disappoints you or those who love you?

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:11.420
Let's watch the next episode of My Teen Life. How can I fix my mistakes?

00:24:20.619 --> 00:24:25.500
I started to make a lot of friends at school and aside from school, I began learning how to

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.059
roll a blade. So whenever I'd go out to practice, I'd meet lots of different people.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:37.660
I made some mistakes because of bad associations. We started going out at night and maybe just

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:43.660
drinking a little alcohol, but eventually we were drinking a lot. By the time I realized what was

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:49.740
happening, I was already really involved. I was 17 years old. I started being close friends with

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:56.619
them. They were everything to me and I really trusted them. They were doing some wrong things like

00:24:56.619 --> 00:25:02.460
drugs and using bad language, but I thought I'm just with them, as long as I don't do what they're

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:14.299
doing. It's not a problem. I began to make excuses saying that it didn't really matter and

00:25:14.299 --> 00:25:18.940
that there wasn't anything wrong with what I was doing. My spiritual routine was just going to the

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:24.539
meetings. I started missing some meetings. I never prayed. I didn't even know how to do personal

00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:31.819
study. I wasn't reading the Bible every day. In this group of friends, there was a boy who liked

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:38.460
me and asked me out. And since all my friends were dating, I thought, why not? So I started dating him

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:44.460
and my parents had no idea. I'd lie about where I was going, what I'd be doing, and who I'd be with.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:49.579
I was pretty much two completely different people. At home, I was one way and with my friends, I was

00:25:49.579 --> 00:25:56.539
another. I tried to pray to Jehovah, but I just couldn't. I felt ashamed because I knew inside

00:25:56.539 --> 00:26:07.059
that Jehovah wasn't happy with what I was doing. My conscience really bothered me. There was

00:26:07.059 --> 00:26:13.859
a moment when my boyfriend and then some of those friends really let me down. I began thinking about

00:26:13.859 --> 00:26:20.900
how I didn't have anyone else in my life. One time we were all drinking and this girl invited

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:26.579
us all to go to our house. I started thinking about what might happen if I said yes to that girl's

00:26:26.579 --> 00:26:35.460
invitation. I knew that there'd be drinking, drugs, and maybe even something a moral might happen.

00:26:36.259 --> 00:26:43.539
So after having not prayed for a really long time, I closed my eyes and said, Jehovah, please help me.

00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:52.819
I'm just so alone, I don't have anyone. I felt completely abandoned by everyone.

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:59.859
So right then and there, I said I prayed to Jehovah asking him that if he would help me to say no,

00:26:59.859 --> 00:27:05.059
from that day forward, I would stop associating with those friends and serve him whole-sold.

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:10.339
Many times, I asked Jehovah to forgive me. I said, Jehovah, you're the only one I have.

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:18.660
Please help me. And that's exactly what happened. After saying that prayer, I felt determined to leave.

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:25.380
I started thinking about everything that I'd done and how I was putting not only my own life at risk,

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:30.099
but also my relationship with Jehovah. I thought I'm going to talk to the elders.

00:27:30.819 --> 00:27:36.339
Since I'm a very shy person, the thought of confessing my mistakes was really difficult.

00:27:36.339 --> 00:27:42.099
I talked to them and I told them everything that happened. It was like a weight had been lifted off me.

00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:49.059
I saw that I really wasn't alone after all. I still remember a scripture that they read to me

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:55.779
at Psalm 86.5, which showed me that Jehovah's forgiveness has no limits if I'm truly repentant.

00:27:55.779 --> 00:28:00.579
So I knew that Jehovah would forgive me, but the elders also told me that I'd have to tell my parents,

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:08.420
which was very difficult. But I thought, well, I need to speak up and I just opened up

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:18.009
and told them about what happened. I decided that I was going to talk with an elder,

00:28:18.009 --> 00:28:24.329
and he read a scripture with me from Philippians 4.7, which says that the peace of God that surpasses

00:28:24.329 --> 00:28:32.089
all understanding will guard our hearts. So I was able to pray again, knowing that if I really

00:28:32.089 --> 00:28:38.410
changed, I could feel that peace that comes from Jehovah. I started studying the Bible for you.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:44.569
I stopped associating with those friends and started being more involved in spiritual things.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:50.329
I had the privilege of getting baptized and becoming a regular pioneer, and today I'm serving in

00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:55.690
Bethel. I had the privilege of being invited to help with construction projects, but my greatest

00:28:55.690 --> 00:29:01.609
privilege is the strong friendship that I have with Jehovah and also having true friends.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:09.049
I've seen that Jehovah has always been by my side, and even when I didn't want to be with him,

00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:35.539
Jehovah never abandoned me. Isn't it encouraging to see how Jehovah gives us just what we need to get

00:29:35.539 --> 00:29:46.180
back up if we stumble? Our loving father is indeed ready to forgive. Our music video this month

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:51.460
reminds us of Jehovah's loving concern for those who suffer a spiritual fall.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:42.890
Provide, get back up when you're down. You can turn this around, get back up, stand up tall,

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:54.069
you can learn, just reach out, take his hand, he'll raise you up, make you stand, and one thing

00:30:54.069 --> 00:31:18.170
that's for sure, you'll be stronger than before. You learn from a fall, the dawn is breaking,

00:31:18.809 --> 00:31:30.900
and your heart but you can't go back in time, you have to see it through. Stop and think it over,

00:31:31.619 --> 00:31:41.619
and take it to Jehovah, his word is there to guide you, to pick you up and show you what to do.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:32:01.660
Back up, you can turn this around, get back up, stand up tall, take his hand, he'll raise you up,

00:32:01.660 --> 00:33:48.680
make you stand, and one thing is love is greeders. That music video beautifully illustrates a point

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:57.880
from our discussion. We can recover from a fall with Jehovah, that's always a reasonable expectation.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:06.039
More than 20 years ago, a Wake magazine published the life story of Alina Jitnikova.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:12.199
Alina realized that pleasing Jehovah would mean rejection by this world.

00:34:13.559 --> 00:34:20.199
But in the following episode of Where Are They Now, know what she describes as perhaps an even

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:29.719
bigger test. My name is Alina Jitnikova, and I was born into a family of a zealous

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:37.000
communist. We believed that a world was coming where people would have everything they needed,

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:48.380
they'd be happy, there would be peace worldwide, and I deeply believed it. But I found paradise

00:34:48.380 --> 00:35:02.360
among God's people. As I grew up, I realized that communism had its deficits,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:13.429
because I saw its hypocrisy. People didn't practice what they preached. In high school,

00:35:13.429 --> 00:35:23.110
I'm a friend who started talking about God and the Bible. So the fact that God's name is Jehovah,

00:35:24.869 --> 00:35:32.869
that something called God's Kingdom and Armageddon will come, these were all new concepts for me.

00:35:35.139 --> 00:35:40.900
I'd never heard of these things before. I'd never even held a Bible in my hand.

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:52.940
A Bible study gradually helped me gain faith. In 1983, I was baptized in a bathtub.

00:35:53.739 --> 00:36:02.380
At that time, Jehovah's Witnesses were under ban. In 1989, the Velvet Revolution took place in

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:12.300
Czechoslovakia, that also meant a change for Jehovah's Witnesses, because we could begin to express

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:20.699
our faith publicly. The house to house ministry started, and it was something amazing and new for me.

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:29.219
I got to know Petr in our local congregation, and we got married in 1990.

00:36:30.179 --> 00:36:37.300
We entered into a full-time service, two years after the wedding. We first started serving as

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:46.500
regular pioneers, and two years later, we were invited to Bethel. Those were years full of joy,

00:36:47.699 --> 00:36:56.139
full of hard work, which greatly enriched me. We left Bethel eight years later,

00:36:56.539 --> 00:37:04.260
and I found that people had changed, and it was a challenge for us.

00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:14.489
Because now people have become more materialistic. When I learned the truth, it seemed to me that

00:37:14.489 --> 00:37:20.570
Armageddon was at the door, that it would come soon. And the world helped us in a way,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:29.289
because it didn't want us, it didn't want Jehovah's Witnesses. But today's world, with its freedom,

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:37.369
doesn't tell us that it doesn't want us. In fact, it wants us. It wants our time.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:48.500
It wants our attention. And therefore, there may be a great danger. We could feel that Armageddon

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:58.500
is delaying, so we might feel the need to fulfill our dreams already today. Jehovah teaches me to be

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:08.420
patient. Jehovah is a happy God. And even when he waits, he does not wait idly. Jehovah is hard

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:17.699
working. He's always doing something. When you feel the waiting with activity, time goes faster.

00:38:19.619 --> 00:38:24.900
The field ministry is very important to me. Sometimes it costs a little effort,

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:31.780
but my service partners are always a great encouragement to me. With Jehovah's help,

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:39.059
we have nice conversations in service. And even today, we find people who think about the meaning

00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:49.210
of life. Service does not only consist of house to house service. Service is the whole Christian

00:38:49.289 --> 00:38:57.610
way of life, including caring for brothers and sisters. I think serving my brothers and sisters

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:07.460
requires us to set aside time for them. In this way, I can promote a good atmosphere in the congregation.

00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:17.369
To be in the spiritual paradise, I must contribute something. As a result, the spiritual

00:39:17.369 --> 00:39:25.769
paradise will be bigger, deeper and more beautiful. When we do something for others,

00:39:26.969 --> 00:39:36.889
we don't think too much about ourselves, our pain. And I think life in Jehovah's service

00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:52.659
is sometimes challenging, but the result is happiness. And already today, I can say that my dream

00:39:52.659 --> 00:40:14.570
of a happy life has come true. We're encouraged to see Sister Alana Jitnikova and her husband

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:21.130
Petter remain busy in kingdom service. How wonderful that this has helped them to have

00:40:21.929 --> 00:40:30.409
realistic expectations and continue to remain joyful. In a world that wants our time and energy,

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:37.130
Alana maintains her focus by sharing her Christian hope, caring for her brothers and sisters,

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:45.690
and doing her all to encourage others. What if you want to encourage others? But you don't know what

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:52.250
to say. Notice the lessons we learned from the Apostle Paul's example, and this morning

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:59.130
worship presented by Brother David Schaeffer. If you have any word of encouragement,

00:40:59.849 --> 00:41:08.809
tell it. Who said those words? How were what did the Apostle Paul say in response? How did his

00:41:08.809 --> 00:41:15.610
audience react? And what can Paul's example teach us about encouragement? Let's open our

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:21.690
Bibles to Acts chapter 13. This is the account of Paul's first missionary tour. After a dangerous

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:28.650
journey of about 110 miles, Paul and his companions find themselves seated in a synagogue in Pesidian

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:36.489
Antioch. Verse 15 says, after the public reading of the law and the prophets, the presiding officers of

00:41:36.489 --> 00:41:42.010
the synagogue sent word to them, saying, men, brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:50.409
the people, tell it. Well, the next five paragraphs contain Paul's speech. How effective was it?

00:41:50.889 --> 00:41:58.730
Verses 42 through 44 show the results. First, the people begged Paul to come back and give another

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:06.010
talk the next weekend. Second, many Jews and proselytes became believers. Third, the following

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:13.050
Sabbath, nearly all the city turned out to hear Paul's next talk. Impressive. We have to ask ourselves,

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:21.449
what did Paul say in those five paragraphs that was so persuasive? Well, one of the first things

00:42:21.449 --> 00:42:29.050
we note is his introduction, Acts chapter 13 verse 17, the God of this people Israel chose

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:38.250
our forefathers. Now note that inclusive pronoun our, not your forefathers, not mine, our forefathers.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:43.449
Did you realize that the last time that little word was used in the book of Acts was all the way back

00:42:43.449 --> 00:42:52.329
in chapter 7 during Stephen's powerful speech. Stephen used the word our 10 times, usually in connection

00:42:52.329 --> 00:42:58.650
with the word forefathers. Paul heard that speech back when he was Saul of Tarsus. And now more than

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:05.769
decade later, he himself uses the exact same expression for the same purpose to establish

00:43:05.769 --> 00:43:14.170
common ground. Your ancestors are my ancestors. I am what you are. And that is the starting point

00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:21.130
of true encouragement. The Watchtower article from which our text is taken says that the Greek word

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:28.730
usually translated encouragement literally means a calling to one side. And yes, it's related to

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:35.929
the Greek word for comfort, which has a similar connotation. So Paul began from their perspective.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:42.250
I know where you're coming from. I grew up learning the same Holy writings as you. And then in

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:49.530
verses 17 through 31, he uses Jewish history and recent events to prove that Jesus was the Messiah

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:58.409
then and verses 32 through 37. He connects current events with fulfilled prophecy. Prophecy,

00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:05.210
they knew we do that today. Don't we? We go to the door. We read Matthew 24, 7. We ask,

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:09.449
what do you think? Are the wars, famines, and earthquakes that we've seen in recent years the same

00:44:09.449 --> 00:44:16.889
as ever or a distinct fulfillment of Bible prophecy? And what is the message that Jehovah is real,

00:44:16.889 --> 00:44:24.010
that Jehovah is alive. His word is coming true. And yet Paul went further, didn't he? He didn't

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:34.409
stop there. In verse 33, Paul said, God has completely fulfilled it to us. Yes, this is personal.

00:44:34.409 --> 00:44:41.929
Jehovah is at work in your life in my life. Then the big conclusion verses 38 through 41. In effect,

00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:48.809
Jehovah did this for you. Don't miss out. You can succeed with Jehovah's help. That was Paul's

00:44:48.809 --> 00:44:57.289
answer to a simple request for a word of encouragement. That's why Paul made disciples. And isn't that

00:44:57.289 --> 00:45:04.010
how we're counseled to fulfill our student assignments today? To strengthen and encourage your audience,

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:10.809
we should show what Jehovah has done, what he is doing, and what he will yet do.

00:45:11.849 --> 00:45:17.929
But Paul's speech was so persuasive that it also drew persecution, which followed him to the

00:45:17.929 --> 00:45:24.889
next two cities. In Listera, his persecutors thought they had killed him. But Acts chapter 14

00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:34.170
verses 20 and 21 says that on the next day, he left with Barnabas for Derby. After declaring the

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:41.849
good news to that city and making quite a few disciples, they faced a choice. You can see the choice

00:45:41.849 --> 00:45:50.090
on map B13. We're looking at the red lines, indicating Paul's first missionary tour. Derby is the

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:59.050
last stop. But notice the next town over to the east, Tarsus. Sound familiar? Saul of Tarsus. There

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:04.250
was a passageway from Derby to Tarsus. Paul would have known the road. He used it on his second

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:10.889
missionary journey and his third missionary journey, but not this time. Acts 14, 21 and the red

00:46:10.889 --> 00:46:16.809
arrows show that Paul returned to all three cities where he had been persecuted, including

00:46:16.889 --> 00:46:22.969
Pasidia and Antioch, where he first received the request for a word of encouragement.

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:27.849
Why? Why return? It would have been so easy for him to think. You know, we've had a pretty good

00:46:27.849 --> 00:46:32.489
run here. I helped the ruler of Cyprus into the truth. I performed my first miracle striking

00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:38.650
elements blind. We started new congregations in Pasidia and Antioch, Iconium, Listera, Derby. I

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:44.489
endured all manner of hardships, was beaten up and stoned and left for dead successful missionary

00:46:44.489 --> 00:46:53.210
tour, but I need to regroup. No? He didn't think that way. Why? Because the needs of the congregation

00:46:54.250 --> 00:47:02.969
outweighed his own personal feelings or fears. Do you suppose that the opposers who stoned him

00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:11.050
and left him for dead were any kinder to the new disciples in Listera? Besides, who was taking

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:17.849
the lead? Paul needed to appoint overseers. This was a weighty task, so back they went.

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:25.769
Likewise, today, our brothers are putting the needs of the disciples ahead of their own comforts.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:31.369
Do you remember these scenes from Jehovah's Witnesses, Faith in Action, Part 2, Let the Light Shine?

00:47:32.409 --> 00:47:38.570
Brother Pillar explains that when he refused to salute the flag in Windsboro, Texas, he was beaten up

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:46.809
and hanged. Thankfully, the rope broke and he survived to tell the story. What the video doesn't

00:47:46.809 --> 00:47:52.250
tell us is that Oscar Pillars was a circuit overseer, so months later, guess where it was time for

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:59.210
him to return? Windsboro, Texas. Now, in the months since the hanging incident, the brothers hadn't

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:04.170
been preaching downtown. They were preaching in the rurals. And brother Pillar's reason that

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:09.050
if he didn't preach downtown, the brothers may never get the courage to preach there.

00:48:09.769 --> 00:48:14.489
So he checked out all the territories within city limits. They worked there all morning,

00:48:14.489 --> 00:48:21.130
had a beautiful time, no negative incident, except at the very last door. A woman said,

00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:28.809
say, you're one of Jehovah's Witnesses, aren't you? He said, yes, ma'am, I am. She said, you know,

00:48:28.809 --> 00:48:35.769
we hanged one of you people here. And we'll do it again. But he didn't tell her that he was the one

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:42.489
that they hanged. But what a beautiful example of standing with your brothers,

00:48:42.489 --> 00:48:51.050
putting their needs ahead of your own feelings. And we have to say, this Bethel family is not

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:57.449
self-sparing when encouragement is needed. At times, though, it could be easy to think, well,

00:48:57.449 --> 00:49:04.730
I just don't know what to say. But is saying something always necessary?

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:13.050
How do you suppose those enlistra felt just to see Paul again, knowing what it must have taken

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:22.170
for him emotionally, simply to return? That of itself spoke volumes. Okay, but I still feel like

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:29.929
I should say something. What did Paul say? Verse 22, we must enter into the kingdom of God through

00:49:29.929 --> 00:49:38.489
many tribulations, the kingdom. Words of true encouragement always center on the kingdom,

00:49:38.489 --> 00:49:42.409
not like Job's false confidors. Clearly, you have problems here. You must be doing something wrong.

00:49:42.409 --> 00:49:49.289
No, rather, you're imitating Jesus. It brought the wrath of our enemy, well done. And that you're

00:49:49.289 --> 00:49:56.250
willing to suffer proves that this is real. You will see Jehovah back you up now. You will see

00:49:56.250 --> 00:50:05.449
him reward you in the future. Stick with it. Have you been called on to offer a word of encouragement?

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:17.210
Don't overthink it. Just go. Stand beside those who need you. And if you have any word

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:24.969
of encouragement for the people, tell it. Isn't it faith strengthening to consider both

00:50:24.969 --> 00:50:31.050
first century and modern day examples of brothers who poured themselves out to encourage others?

00:50:31.929 --> 00:50:41.079
Even in the face of grave danger, has a health condition caused you to pause and re-evaluate your

00:50:41.079 --> 00:50:47.559
goals and expectations? Please consider the following interview that was presented to the United

00:50:47.559 --> 00:50:54.199
States Bethel family. Well, we have many fine examples of those who have maintained their focus

00:50:54.199 --> 00:51:02.199
during extreme life events. But consider the experience of Felix and Myra Tarazas and the following

00:51:02.199 --> 00:51:09.380
pre-recorded interview. Well, it's a privilege to be with Felix and Myra Tarazas serving at

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:15.940
Wal-Kill. We understand it's been a very difficult year. Could you share some of the details of your

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:22.099
medical condition? Well, about a year and a half ago, I started developing an infrequent pain in

00:51:22.099 --> 00:51:30.340
my chest, which led me to seeing several doctors. Soon thereafter, I was diagnosed with a malignant

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:37.460
tumor that was only going to be treatable by its complete removal. After the surgery, we were hoping

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:44.260
to hear good news moving forward. Then a few weeks later, one of my doctors conveyed to us some of

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:51.619
the most difficult words that one can imagine hearing, a life expectancy of just a few months.

00:51:52.179 --> 00:51:57.940
Wow. That had to have been difficult to hear. How were you able to get your mind wrapped around that?

00:51:58.579 --> 00:52:04.900
Well, as you can imagine, after many intense and tearful prayers asking Jehovah to give us

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:10.260
peace of mind, to give us a comb heart and wisdom to make a good decision,

00:52:11.219 --> 00:52:17.940
we decided on a treatment to hospice care that would allow me to make the most of the time that I

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:27.139
had left and to be able to give my very best to Jehovah. That's remarkable Felix. And Myra,

00:52:27.139 --> 00:52:33.539
you're such a supportive wife. How have you been able to be so positive? I have to say it's my

00:52:33.539 --> 00:52:39.780
hope in Jehovah. That is what's helped me. At the moment, we're sharing in the sufferings,

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:45.780
mentioned the second Corinthians one seven. But the verse concludes we will also share in the comfort

00:52:46.579 --> 00:52:52.579
and we are also experiencing that right now. I have no doubt I'll see Felix again at the

00:52:52.579 --> 00:52:58.179
resurrection. When I look to the future, I can vividly picture us walking through the paradise

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:05.139
earth, enjoying Jehovah's beautiful creation. This is the life, the real life Jehovah promises.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.739
And it's this hope that gives me joy and peace.

00:53:09.699 --> 00:53:15.619
Beautifully expressed. Thank you. And Felix, how have you been able to be so joyful?

00:53:16.579 --> 00:53:21.139
My relationship with Jehovah has never been stronger than it is right now.

00:53:22.099 --> 00:53:28.260
And I believe it's this closeness and this intimacy with him that is providing me the joy

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:36.900
that I'm experiencing. Now, Philippians 4, 6 and 7 assures me that by prayer and by supplication

00:53:37.619 --> 00:53:44.900
it says that the peace of God will guard your hearts. Prayer has been so indispensable in bringing

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:50.099
me peace during this process. And it's also amplified my appreciation for the resurrection,

00:53:50.739 --> 00:53:57.940
like I have never experienced before. Proverbs 12, 25, I think perfectly illustrates our current

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:05.940
situation. There it says, anxiety in a man's heart can weigh it down. But a good word

00:54:06.739 --> 00:54:15.380
says it cheers it up. Both myron and I and I have benefited from what we feel is an enormous

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:21.380
storehouse of good words received in the way of concern, of love and compassion from the

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:29.380
brotherhood. And lastly, my current circumstances have opened up such a wonderful opportunity

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:35.699
to share kingdom truths with family members, including the beautiful privilege of being able to

00:54:35.699 --> 00:54:44.099
study the Bible with my mother during the past few months. Oh, amazing. Tell us, how is this experience

00:54:44.099 --> 00:54:49.699
affected your faith and trust in Jehovah? Well, we have seen Jehovah's hand from the very beginning,

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:56.019
but one time sticks out in my mind. It was the day we received Felix's prognosis.

00:54:57.139 --> 00:55:00.820
That evening, the Bethel family watched our study, considered the article,

00:55:01.539 --> 00:55:07.219
keep calm and trust in Jehovah. And this was followed by a lecture entitled,

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:14.579
remain in Jehovah's everlasting arms. Jehovah provided us exactly what we needed to hear

00:55:14.579 --> 00:55:22.019
that very day. We felt it was an answer to our prayers, as if to reassure us he has everything

00:55:22.019 --> 00:55:27.940
under control. This has strengthened my faith in that Jehovah will continue to more than super

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:35.059
abundantly provide for us care and guidance as we face new challenges. And without a doubt,

00:55:35.059 --> 00:55:42.469
fulfill his promises for the future. I think when you come to understand that you only have a

00:55:42.469 --> 00:55:47.829
short time to live, you know, that's something that can very easily knock you right off of your feet.

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:57.110
But we know that we've been grasped by Jehovah's carrying hands right now. And that is what stabilized

00:55:57.110 --> 00:56:05.110
us. You know, throughout this ordeal, we have seen Jehovah's love, his care and assistance in every

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:11.190
decision and every step that we've taken. From the first visits to the doctors, through surgery,

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:16.150
and into the most difficult part of the prognosis, we have lacked nothing.

00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:24.389
I absolutely know that my faith has only been strengthened by the challenges of this trial.

00:56:25.429 --> 00:56:31.190
So now, as I prepare to close my eyes and fall asleep for just a brief time,

00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:37.750
it is a privilege for me to demonstrate to Jehovah my trust in all of his promises

00:56:38.389 --> 00:56:42.789
and to maintain complete integrity right down to the end.

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:50.550
What an outstanding expression of faith. Thank you both so much for sharing those deeply personal

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:57.510
and motivating expressions. You are a living example of faith in action and we love you.

00:56:58.469 --> 00:57:03.590
I can't tell you how many times I've seen that and it's so moving each time.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:10.389
On June the 8th, 2021, our dear brother Felix went to sleep in death just seven weeks

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:17.030
after this interview. And any, frankly, that was around the trousers during this time. You would see

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:25.190
firsthand the power of faith and their focus and wanting to give Jehovah their absolute best.

00:57:25.269 --> 00:57:31.030
It was true in this. At Myra, the dear Myra continues to show that same faith and endurance

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:37.429
even now. And Felix's mother, she's continued to progress spiritually. We understand that

00:57:37.429 --> 00:57:44.789
Felix will be so happy to hear. For me personally, it's been hardwarming to see

00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:51.110
in Myra's unshakable faith and the love and support she receives from the Bethel family.

00:57:51.989 --> 00:58:01.590
Along with Myra, we long to see Felix again. Even in failing health, he used the strength he had

00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:10.710
to build up those around him. Jehovah truly appreciates shepherds with the same self-sacrificing spirit.

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:17.639
Did you want serve as a congregation elder? Can you serve again?

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:24.519
No, the ways Jehovah assisted two brothers to overcome their feelings of disappointment

00:58:25.079 --> 00:58:32.760
and qualify again to serve their brothers. I served as an elder until the end of 2014.

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.840
And that's when some problems came up and I ended up being disqualified.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:48.539
I had already been serving as an elder for 92 years. But at the time, I felt that the

00:58:48.539 --> 00:58:54.460
best thing to do would be to stop and give up my privilege of service so I could care for myself

00:58:54.460 --> 00:59:02.659
emotionally. Before I lost my privilege, my qualifications were reviewed by the elders on three

00:59:02.659 --> 00:59:10.570
separate occasions. And that ended up dampening my desire to want to serve again in the future.

00:59:11.929 --> 00:59:17.449
I began thinking, published to receive the same reward as an elder. So why should I put myself

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:23.849
through that all over again? When you resign or are disqualified from serving as an elder,

00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:34.820
you're not immune to feeling like you're a failure, feeling sad and especially feeling that you've

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:42.420
let your hover down. And it's a fight to remain active. One of the biggest things that helped me

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:49.619
during that phase was my wife's support. She believed in me and helped motivate me.

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:55.059
My wife was already a pioneer and she encouraged me to start pioneering too.

00:59:55.059 --> 00:59:58.820
So within just a few months, I had already started serving as a pioneer.

01:00:00.099 --> 01:00:05.139
It was in the ministry that I began to cultivate a desire to serve once again as an elder.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:11.940
Getting involved in activities with a congregation, helping out with the cleaning.

01:00:15.019 --> 01:00:19.980
Being with my wife in the preaching work, conducting Bible studies.

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:27.929
I had a lot of help from the brothers who cried with me when I needed to cry.

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:32.809
And who laughed with me when it was possible to laugh.

01:00:33.769 --> 01:00:38.489
A mature elder helped me to see that I needed to leave the matter in Jehovah's hands.

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:42.250
That time period when I stopped serving as an elder,

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:46.010
I can say that that may have been when I prayed the most in all my life.

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:53.369
I still wasn't an elder but I felt at peace. I remembered first John 320 that Jehovah is

01:00:53.369 --> 01:01:00.329
greater than our hearts and that he knew what I was going through. And just because I wasn't

01:01:00.329 --> 01:01:06.250
serving any longer as an elder, that didn't make Jehovah love me any less. That helped me a lot.

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:12.250
The most difficult thing to overcome was really the resentment that I felt towards some brothers

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.409
who had participated in the whole process.

01:01:16.329 --> 01:01:21.369
The scripture at Psalm 119, 165, helped me to see that when you're going through a difficult

01:01:21.369 --> 01:01:29.219
situation, that's the time that you need to show that you love Jehovah. I could see that during

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:35.059
that time of my life, that's when I had the show that I really loved Jehovah. I would pray to Jehovah,

01:01:35.619 --> 01:01:39.460
each and every day. And I would mention those brothers by name.

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:45.940
That helped me to start softening my heart to lesson and eventually to eliminate this resentment.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:02:00.489
Trusting in Jehovah was so worth it. And I felt like it was a great act of love on his part

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:07.690
to allow me once again to serve as an elder. And if as if he told me, Marcelo,

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:10.570
I trusted you are going to do a good job as an elder.

01:02:11.769 --> 01:02:16.889
We just have to trust in Jehovah. When I began to show more trust, that's when things started

01:02:16.889 --> 01:02:22.570
happening in a way that I couldn't have imagined. In less than two years, I had already began serving

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:28.409
as an elder again. And in 2016, we received an invitation to serve at Bethel.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.659
My wife and I have now been serving here at Bethel for a little more than 10 years.

01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:46.630
When you accept the discipline, then you stop thinking about privileges and start thinking

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:50.309
more about the brothers and about being more involved in the ministry.

01:02:51.429 --> 01:02:57.670
I still had the most important privilege. That of being one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:08.250
Today we learn how important it is to have realistic and reasonable expectations.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:11.289
Both of ourselves and of our brothers and sisters,

01:03:11.929 --> 01:03:19.210
instead of being discouraged with what we cannot do, we rely on Jehovah and set goals according to

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:27.369
what we can do. My teen life in our music video reminded us that Jehovah will give us the help we

01:03:27.369 --> 01:03:35.530
need to get back up if we suffer a spiritual setback. And in where are they now? We caught up with

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:42.889
sister Alana Jitnikova, who reminded us that serving our brothers and sisters can keep us focused

01:03:42.889 --> 01:03:50.920
and joyful. We end this once program with our video postcard from our brothers and sisters in

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:58.360
Costa Rica. Costa Rica is a sparkling gem that sits on the so-called Ring of Fire, a chain

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:05.719
approximately 40,000 kilometers or 25,000 miles long that contains about three quarters of the earth's

01:04:05.719 --> 01:04:15.239
volcanoes. Costa Rica has 61 volcanoes and six active ones. The weather and mountainous countryside

01:04:15.239 --> 01:04:24.039
are ideal for growing delicious coffee. The name Costa Rica means rich coast in Spanish.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:32.920
This is just a small sampling of all the different animal species here. And some are found nowhere else

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:41.480
on earth. With this country of more than five million inhabitants, both other riches that are

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:50.440
truly precious to Jehovah. Over 32,000 publishers of the good news live in Costa Rica and around

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:59.960
4,000 serve as regular pioneers. Their territory is vast and diverse. Even though Spanish is the

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:06.519
official language, there are groups and congregations in 10 languages. Let's go to the city of

01:05:06.519 --> 01:05:13.639
Limón, established near where Christopher Columbus arrived around 1502. Here we find a Creole

01:05:13.639 --> 01:05:19.880
language congregation in Costa Rica. Our brothers here love to participate in the ministry.

01:05:20.599 --> 01:05:27.400
For example, they do phone and letter witnessing and they conduct around 65 Bible studies each month.

01:05:28.119 --> 01:05:34.519
Creole speaking people have profound respect for God's word and love to learn about Jehovah.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:40.360
The publishers make good use of the publications and videos available in the police

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:46.519
Creole language. Several of these brothers have helped with the translation and audio recording

01:05:46.519 --> 01:05:54.519
of the Bible and other publications, videos and songs in police Creole. Our dear brothers and

01:05:54.519 --> 01:06:00.039
sisters from Limón, Costa Rica, send their love and greetings to the worldwide brotherhood.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.920
And we send all of you our love as well. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:06:07.559 --> 01:06:18.679
this is JW Broadcasting.
