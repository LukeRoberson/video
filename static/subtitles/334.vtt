00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.990
Many of us are concerned about how to care well for aging parents, not only because of

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.470
what it says in the quoted portion of today's text, but also because of the phrase at the

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.830
end of 1 Timothy chapter 5 and verse 4. If you tap the citation at the end of today's

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.829
text, you get the rest of the verse, namely, for this is acceptable in God's sight. And

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.789
that tells us just how important a matter this is. Notice the interlinear rendering. The

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.869
term translated God, the devotion is literally to be revering well, which could denote being

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.829
generally virtuous toward anyone. And perhaps that's why a number of translations in our

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.070
list here in J.W. Library simply say to show piety. Still others, such as the Jerusalem

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.829
Bible, render the term to do their duty. But honoring our parents is more than just our

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.070
duty toward humans. It's more than just virtue for its own sake. The verse itself says this

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.629
is acceptable in God's sight. So we love our parents, yes, they deserve our care, yes.

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:12.829
That's virtuous, of course. But principally, we care for our aging parents because we

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:20.390
revered Jehovah. We care about what Jehovah says is right conduct toward family members.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.549
It's a matter of godly devotion. So what are some of the factors to keep in mind? Our commoners

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:32.829
have helped us so much. The comments point out that exactly how children provide care varies

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:40.390
because situations vary. But here's four practical things we can do. First, communicate. Second,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:50.510
determine the real needs. Third, have reasonable expectations. And fourth, always remember to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:02:00.430
throw your burden on Jehovah. First turn please to Proverbs chapter 15 and verse 22. Communicate,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:09.469
communicate, communicate. And what is this result in? It says, plans fail when there is no

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:18.949
consultation. But there is accomplishment through many advisors. So keep in touch, call,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.789
write, email, text, Skype. Once a week, more often, especially as they age, satisfy their spiritual

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:32.069
needs. Keep them apprised of what's going on at Bethel and the rich treasures you enjoy here

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.430
in your service. Care for their emotional needs by reminding them just how valuable they are.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.310
But regarding their material needs, it's important to ask the right questions. It's easy to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.509
conclude they're doing okay. But this is where the many advisors come in. Keep in touch with

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:55.030
other family members, the local congregation, get the whole story through the sheer multiplicity

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.750
of counselors doesn't in itself guarantee accurate data. A majority can be wrong. That's why Exodus 23,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.750
two cautions us against just going along with the crowd. However, when we're trying to make important

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.629
decisions, we need to get a clear picture of what's actually going on in their lives. And that

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.189
leads to our second point, determine the real needs. Notice what it says here in Proverbs 14 and

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:25.270
verse 15. Some parents have made wise provision for their old age pensions, insurance, retirement

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:33.189
funds. But what if these run out? Then what? Time to quit? Get a house? It's good that we honor

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.949
our parents. And never would we want to treat them with contempt. That's exactly what Jesus condemned.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:48.629
And yet in some cases, we have to think about what it says in Proverbs 14 and verse 15. Notice what

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:59.830
it says at the end. The shrewd one ponders each step. Family happiness. Page 176 raises 11 pertinent

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.629
questions. It says, suppose your elderly mother is having difficulty living alone and you think

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:10.789
she might benefit from moving in with you, you might consider what her actual needs. Are there

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:16.790
private or state-sponsored support services that offer an acceptable alternative solution? Does she

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:24.790
want to move? If she does, in what ways will her life be affected? Will she have to leave friends

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.629
behind? How might this affect her emotionally? Have you talked to these things over with her?

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.470
How might such a move affect you? You're made. If your mother needs care, who will provide it? Can

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.829
the responsibility be shared? Have you discussed the matter with all those directly involved?

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.949
In one of the most touching accounts on this subject, John, chapter 19 verses 26 and 27,

00:04:51.670 --> 00:05:01.430
we read that Jesus, when he saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.230
to his mother, woman, see your son. Next, he said to the disciple, see your mother and from that

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:15.670
hour on, the disciple took her into his own home. Yes, despite all that was weighing on Jesus'

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.750
shoulders at that precise moment, not to mention the incredible pain he was enduring. He took the

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.910
time to take care of his mother. But what did he do? Did he summon 12 legions of angels and postpone

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:37.110
his execution? No, he delegated responsibility to a relative and not his brothers because they

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:45.029
apparently were not yet believers. What an amazing example of balancing the real needs of all

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:53.350
concerned. Well, that brings us to our third point, have reasonable expectations of our parents,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:00.709
of our relatives, of the congregation. First Corinthians 16 and 14 says, let everything you do

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:10.870
be done with love. Beautiful text. Now, the responsibility rests primarily upon each Christian

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:16.069
to care for his own household, children, grandchildren, other close relatives, display Christian love

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:21.750
by providing assistance to the elderly and infirm ones, according to their needs. But congregations

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:31.910
of Jehovah's Witnesses do not weaken this personal responsibility by taking over. The Bethel family

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.389
is really to be commended for the variety of ways in which you're shouldering this very heavy

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:42.149
responsibility. How this must please Jehovah. And that leads to our final point.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:51.589
Remember to throw your burdens on Jehovah. As pointed out in our comments, Jehovah can bless any

00:06:52.629 --> 00:07:01.509
scriptural decision and make it work. How encouraging those words are. And then it cites numbers

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:11.029
11, 23. The hand of Jehovah is not short. Only our lack of trust in Jehovah would limit

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:18.550
what he will do for us. And although Jehovah can work miracles, we don't expect that we will never

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:24.230
have to participate in the solution of giving care to our aging parents. Why not? Because by learning

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:30.310
to practice godly devotion in our own households, we have the opportunity to show the depth

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.029
of our unselfish motives in serving Jehovah. And that proves the devil a liar.

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:41.910
Nevertheless, notice this encouraging promise at Psalm 145 verse 18.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:51.029
Jehovah is near to all those calling on him, to all who call on him in truth. He satisfies the

00:07:51.029 --> 00:08:00.069
desire of those who fear him. He hears their cry for help and he rescues them. Jehovah helps.

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.670
Maybe you yourself are the instrument in Jehovah's hands to make sure that your parents are

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:11.750
well cared for. Your work may actually be the expression of Jehovah's love and answer to your

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.350
parents prayers.
