00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:11.660
My phone was a door to just about everything, but that door opened to some places I shouldn't have gone.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:25.660
At first I thought, it's not pornography, so it's okay, but still, what I was seeing filled my mind with immoral thoughts.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.660
And I couldn't stop.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.659
Galatians 678 reads, do not be misled.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.659
God is not one to be mocked.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:42.659
For whatever a person is sewing, this, he will also reap.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.380
Reep what you sow.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.380
Reep what you sow.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.380
I was sowing unclean desires.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
And reaping a double heart.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:05.859
Desensitized, things Jehovah hates.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:11.859
Turn my eyes away from looking at what is worthless.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.859
It wasn't just whether an image is considered pornography.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.859
Anything that stirs up unclean thoughts is worthless.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.859
And I should turn my eyes away.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.859
But I had to do more.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:33.950
Those weren't just the psalmist words.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.129
They had to be my words.

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:45.129
Words I've had to act on ever since to stay loyal to Jehovah.
