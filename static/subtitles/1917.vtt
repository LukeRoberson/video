00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.809
Welcome to our update.

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:11.810
In this program, we'll consider Bible principles that guide us when making decisions about dress and grooming.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.809
But first, here are a few updates about our relief work following recent disasters.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:27.809
In Southeast Africa, several countries, including Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, are facing serious drought.

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:36.810
The Zimbabwe branch estimates that some 13,500 publishers in that land need basic assistance to survive.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:45.810
Additionally, some of our brothers in Malawi experience flooding that damaged their homes and destroyed their remaining food supplies.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:53.810
During the end of April, Brother Gage Flegal visited Malawi and Zimbabwe to encourage the brothers and sisters.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:07.810
To provide relief from these recent disasters, the governing body has sent funds so that our brothers may receive essential food items such as maize, beans, dried fish, and cooking oil.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.810
In Japan, you'll recall that there was a magnitude 7.6 earthquake in January.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.810
It damaged over 600 of our brothers' homes and destroyed 8, and 13 kingdom halls were damaged.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.810
Since then, the government has worked to repair the local infrastructure.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.810
The branch office is working hard to help our brothers to repair and rebuild their homes.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.810
On April 3, Taiwan experienced its strongest earthquake in over 25 years.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.810
It triggered tsunami warnings in Japan and the Philippines.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.810
We're glad that none of our brothers were killed or severely injured, and none of their homes had major damage.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:04.810
But 20 kingdom halls and the Amis language remote translation office sustained minor damage. The repair work is underway.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:13.810
Despite the hardships caused by these disasters, our brothers and sisters are quick to volunteer to assist with relief work.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.810
And we thank all of you for your prayers as well as your generous donations that make this relief work possible.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.699
Very soon, something exciting is being released on video on demand.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:33.699
It's a video about a Bible manuscript that people thought had been destroyed.

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:42.699
The manuscript is an English translation of the Christian Greek scriptures, where Jehovah's name occurs over 200 times.

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:48.699
Let's watch a preview of the video entitled A Lost Bible Translation Rediscovered.

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:57.069
Translation in the 18th century was the center of political and theological dispute.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.069
This was a time when you could not state what you think too openly.

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:11.069
Truth-seeking of the kind that he followed was not something that was welcomed by your authorities.

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:21.069
If you believe that the Bible is a collection of sacred writings, you're not going to be very happy if there are some very obvious errors in the translations.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:28.069
Taking it for granted, that was not what we were here to do. We were here to ask questions.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.069
This was a translation undertaken by real scholars who knew their Hebrew and Greek.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.069
We had always assumed that this translation had been lost at that point.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.699
It's absolutely fascinating, and it needs bringing to a wider audience.

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:56.819
We're sure you'll enjoy watching the full-length video about this fascinating discovery.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:07.819
Recently, we've had updates about dress and grooming. We've talked about beards for brothers, slacks for sisters, and the use of jackets and ties for brothers.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.819
We're thankful that Jehovah trusts us in these matters.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.819
But some questions come up.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:22.819
First of all, do these adjustments about dress and grooming mean that we are lowering our standards?

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:29.819
Not at all. Our worship of Jehovah deserves our deep respect and honor.

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:35.819
These adjustments should not dilute the depth of our appreciation for serving Jehovah.

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:47.819
More so, it's a recognition that styles change over time, and that what's considered acceptable dignified dress for certain occasions also changes over time.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:54.819
For example, do you remember these images from the 2023 governing body update number eight?

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:04.819
We wouldn't expect that we would still dress as people did in Bible times, nor would we expect that we would still dress the same as people did 100 years ago.

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:12.819
Times change. What's considered respectable and dignified dress and grooming changes over time.

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:19.540
The adjustments announced in recent updates acknowledged that.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:32.540
Another question that arises with this new direction is, how do we make sure that we still dignified Jehovah and his worship when it comes to beards, slacks, and not wearing ties?

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.540
As is the case with all dress and grooming, there are a variety of styles.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.540
Let's consider three principles from God's Word.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.540
You know these principles, and you love Jehovah. We know that they are important to you.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:57.540
So let's see how these verses can guide us when making decisions about our dress and grooming.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.540
First, let's consider first Timothy 2, 9 and 10.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:23.540
It reads, likewise, the women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing, but in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to God, namely through good works.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.540
From what we read in these verses, what should characterize our dress and grooming?

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:37.540
The world may choose clothing simply based on what's most comfortable, but as Christians we have other things to consider.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:46.540
We profess devotion to God. As Christian men and women, we want our dress and grooming to glorify Jehovah.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:57.540
And so we choose styles that are appropriate, modest, and that reflect soundness of mind, especially when we go to the kingdom hall or in the ministry.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:03.540
What do these terms mean? Let's consider some of the study notes on these verses.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:11.540
For the term appropriate, the study note explains it this way, or respectable.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:24.540
In this context, the Greek word used suggests dress that would be considered honorable and proper, such a tire would be suitable for one who professes to be a minister of God.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:32.540
If our clothes are revealing or tight, would that be appropriate, honorable, or proper?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.540
Would that be suitable to wear when worshipping Jehovah?

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.540
I'm sure you would agree that it would not be appropriate.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:47.540
That means that we need to carefully evaluate what we will wear, especially when we are worshipping Jehovah.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:55.540
If our clothes are casual, would that be appropriate for us to wear when worshipping Jehovah at the meetings or when in the ministry?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.540
Well, no, that wouldn't be appropriate.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:05.540
Of course, I'm sure you would agree that what's considered appropriate also depends on the occasion.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:11.540
For example, there are clothes that are appropriate for when we go to the beach or on a picnic.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.540
And there are clothes that are appropriate for when we attend a wedding.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:22.540
And there are also clothes that are appropriate for when we go to worship at the kingdom hall or in the ministry.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.540
What's the point?

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:36.539
Although styles change over time, it's good for us to recognize that there are different levels of dress that should be decided based on the occasion.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.539
That's an idea we all want to keep in mind.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.539
Let's consider the next study note.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.539
What does it mean to dress with modesty?

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:58.539
The study note says in this context, modesty includes taking into consideration one's own conscience as well as the feelings or opinions of others.

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:08.539
A modest Christian would avoid a dormant that is considered indecent, that draws undue attention, or that is likely to offend or stumble others.

00:09:08.539 --> 00:09:16.539
So when making decisions, we consider how others would be affected, our brothers and sisters as well as the community.

00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:24.539
Of course, we would not be displaying modesty if our style of dress or grooming was viewed as odd or extreme.

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:31.539
We don't want to draw undue attention to ourselves or distract others by the way we dress or groom ourselves.

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:39.539
We want all attention to go to Jehovah and the kingdom message that we proclaim.

00:09:39.539 --> 00:09:41.539
Let's consider the next study note.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:45.539
What does the term soundness of mine mean?

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:52.539
The study note says it refers to good judgment, sensableness.

00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:57.539
This quality helps us to avoid appearing sloppy or untidy.

00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:02.539
Imagine you were invited to a formal reception with government officials.

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:04.539
How would you dress?

00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:08.539
Would you wear your pajamas or something you would wear to the beach?

00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:09.539
Definitely not.

00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:16.539
We would want to dress in a way that showed respect for the occasion and for those present.

00:10:16.539 --> 00:10:24.980
How much more so when we worship Jehovah at the meetings or when we share in the ministry?

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.980
Let's consider a second Bible principle.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.980
It's found that 2 Corinthians 6, 3 and 4.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:38.980
In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling so that no fault may be found with our ministry.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.980
But in every way we recommend ourselves as God's ministers.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:52.980
It's good for us to analyze how our dress and grooming will affect the way others view our ministry and the God we worship.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:11:00.980
After all, people may form an opinion of the truth, good or bad based on our appearance.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:10.980
We can ask ourselves, in this part of the territory, would the neighbors view me as one of God's ministers if I dress or groom myself this way?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:18.840
Would they see the distinction between Jehovah's people and those who do not serve God?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.840
What's the third principle we'll consider?

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.840
It's 1 John 2 15 through 17.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.840
Do not love either the world or the things in the world.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.840
If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:42.840
Because everything in the world, the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one's means of life,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.840
does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.840
Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.840
But the one who does the will of God remains forever.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:01.840
From these verses, we're reminded that our dress and grooming should not reflect a love of the world.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.840
The styles change over the years, and there are a wide variety of styles that are not offensive to most people.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:17.840
Our publications have often stated that we should not be the first to adopt a new style or the last to abandon an old one.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.840
But we all know that there are many styles that we would never want to adopt,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:29.840
especially those that are immodest, sensual, careless, or sloppy.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:38.840
And to be honest, we need to consider not just the style of the garment, but also whether that garment fits in a modest way.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.840
We would never want to show disrespect for Jehovah or his righteous standards.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:52.570
We've considered three Bible principles that can help us make good decisions about our dress.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:13:00.570
Of course, these same principles apply to hairstyles, beards, and to all the ways we dress and groom ourselves.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.570
They help us to determine the length and style of our hair.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:11.570
Brothers use them to determine how to groom their beards so that they look sharp and well cared for.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:17.570
And aren't we grateful that Jehovah has given us these principles in his word?

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:22.570
It's so good to review them in view of the recent adjustments.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.570
But what else should we do with these reminders?

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.570
Pray about them.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.570
Ask Jehovah to help you see if any changes are needed.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:38.570
Ask a spiritually mature friend for honest comments and family heads.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:45.570
Show your love for your wife and children by helping them to apply these principles.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:50.570
Brothers and sisters, we love and respect you very much.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:55.570
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
