WEBVTT

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.490
Did Jesus explain to His disciples how that perfect body came to be? Did He take the time to do that?

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.449
We don't know, but what we do know is

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.570
how He used that perfect body when He was on earth

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.929
has a profound effect upon our relationship with Jehovah God when we meditate and think about that.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:27.329
And that's what we want to focus on in our discussion this morning, but how did that body come about?

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.769
Let's find out. Let's open our Bibles, please, to Luke chapter 1,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.520
Luke chapter 1, and we're going to look at verse 31.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:48.909
Now the angel Gabriel and speaking to Mary, he says, look, you will become pregnant and you will give birth to a son

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.030
You're to name him Jesus, pregnant me. I'm a virgin. How can that happen? Jehovah employed His Holy Spirit

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.469
in transferring the perfect life force of His only begotten son to the womb of Mary

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.189
Thus causing conception

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.870
Jehovah would cancel out any imperfection that would be passed on to the child

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.349
thereby producing a genetic pattern that was perfect from its start.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.150
Imperfection was not going to stop Jehovah's purpose from being

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.870
from being accomplished. He dealt with that. He handled that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.069
very interesting here to in verse 35

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.590
and answer the angel said to her

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:42.269
Holy Spirit will come upon you. The power of the most high will overshadow you. So again, Holy Spirit's involved and

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.109
in some manner a Jehovah guaranteed that it would be a boy and then he assured that that developing embryo

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:56.870
would be shielded from the taint of sin and protected from any harmful force. So there she has

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.349
this baby boy. She was a Jewish mother. So no doubt that Jesus would have had some of the physical traits of Mary

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.349
His Jewish mother

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:12.949
However, we need to remember that he was not another personality. He was not another person

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:18.990
He was the only begotten son and he was able to identify himself as such in due time

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.430
But now imagine Mary

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.310
giving birth to this little baby

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.990
And she's holding this little baby in her arms now

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.110
How many mothers have said to us when that baby is born and they're holding that baby and they say look at my baby

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.870
It's perfect

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.870
But Mary was right

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.030
She got it right. She was the only one that could say my baby is perfect

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.189
She didn't have to count the toes and the fingers and so forth. She got it

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:53.310
But but but the thought is is that though she didn't fully understand

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.509
All the details

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:04.590
She's holding this body and it's this body that 33 and a half years is holding the blood

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:09.469
That's going to be poured out in behalf of mankind as a ransom sacrifice

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.389
But before that blood was going to be poured out

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.430
Jesus was going to use that body in a very special way he used his fleshly body to honor Jehovah God

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:30.189
So again, understanding how he used that fleshly body to honor Jehovah has a profound effect upon our relationship with Jehovah

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.789
Let's see how it's open on Bibles now to first Peter chapter 4

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.780
first Peter chapter 4

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.379
we're going to read verse 1

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.659
Since Christ suffered in the flesh

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.340
suffered in the flesh you to arm yourselves with the same mental disposition

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.139
Because the person who has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins. Let's think about this for a moment

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.379
Christ suffered in the flesh

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.139
That fleshly body this is directly related to the issue of sovereignty

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.579
His blood paid the ransom

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.540
But why did Christ suffer in the flesh

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.060
Because he chose to use his fleshly body to honor Jehovah

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.540
He chose to use his fleshly body to defend Jehovah's sovereignty

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.779
He chose to use that fleshly body to prove that Satan is a liar

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.819
He suffered in the flesh on nice and 1433 CE

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.740
Jesus allowed himself to be arrested by a mob

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.579
He allowed himself to be subjected to an illegal trial

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:54.579
He allowed his back to be torn by ribbons scurved through a scourgey and to be nailed to his hands and feet to a pole

00:04:55.459 --> 00:05:00.579
He allowed that and this is why he said at John chapter 10 verse 16

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:04.500
This is this is why the father loves me

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.740
The father loves me why because I surrender my life

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.660
No man takes my life from me. I surrender it of my own initiative

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.980
That's the example he said for us now. Let's look at verse one again this time

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:28.339
We see that be part where it says because the person

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.540
Who has suffered in the flesh? So who is that that you that's me where the person we suffer in the flesh

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.939
We desist from sins verse two

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:46.579
So that he you me may live the remainder of his time in the flesh no more for the desires of men

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.750
But for God's will

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.670
The fact that Peter draws attention to suffering in the flesh for you and me

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:00.750
This is what we're expected to do there. We're imitating Jesus Christ by doing that

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.750
So here we are this very special week of activity. We think deeply

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.629
Upon the ransom sacrifice. We think deeply about how Jesus used his life

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.949
And we have opportunity to do that for example

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:19.310
Some ask why do we pass the emblems on memorial night?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.069
They say if in a large congregation there are so many there wouldn't be more practical if the service just stood at the

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:28.990
End of the aisle and if someone wanted to partake of the emblems

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.230
They would just nod or give a sign to the server and he would give them to that person

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.470
Look at the time we would save

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.029
But that's not the pattern in the scriptures. That's not what Jesus did

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:44.430
That's not the procedure that was instituted. We're following the biblical pattern

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:51.069
But in addition to that in the actual passing of the emblems. What does that do

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.870
That deepens our appreciation as we see the red pass as we see the wine pass

00:06:57.949 --> 00:06:59.470
We are able to

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.470
Understand the sacred things that are discussed even more so that evening

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:10.750
And we're able to get involved our feelings are get involved get involved that event burns into our memory

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:18.350
So this Friday as those emblems are being passed as the bread is being passed now

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.750
You might say but I've been to so many memorials and

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.910
Some in our family have been to decades worth of memorials

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.709
But how about this Friday we do something different we just

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:37.709
As that bread passes we just think we just take a moment to reflect on what that bread represents

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:41.149
And we ask ourselves

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:43.069
Can I

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:47.550
Think of one way that I can use my body my mind

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.350
my energy

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:51.949
To better

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:55.470
Worship Jehovah God is there one way that I can do better

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.949
To what extent am I slaving for others as Jesus Christ did

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:09.470
Like Jesus Christ to what extent am I humbling my body and leading it as a slave

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:16.110
Even if it has to take drastic measures of at times with self-control to make sure that

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:22.670
I am giving an answer to the one who was taunting my heavenly Father

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:30.189
When we examine the life of Jesus Christ it's as if he said to the devil it says if he declared

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:34.590
You want to attack my father you go through me

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:41.549
You're going to go through me because I am Michael who is like God no one attacks my God

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:51.629
I'm the chief defender of his sovereignty. I am the champion of my God. I'm the chief vindicator of him

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.350
That's who I am

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.309
And we take that same stance that same posture

00:08:58.429 --> 00:09:03.789
Someone wants to attack our Heavenly Father you want to attack my Heavenly Father devil you go through me

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:11.470
You go through me and my integrity my obedience my faithful course you know what it will do will embarrass you

00:09:12.429 --> 00:09:15.149
It's going to push you back. It's going to humiliate you

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:21.950
It's going to disgrace you because I'm using my body as Jesus Christ did to honor my Heavenly Father
