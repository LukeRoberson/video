00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:08.109
From the moment we are born, we experience the world through our senses.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:18.219
Touch, let's us feel safe and loved.

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:22.690
We use it to explore and learn.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.690
The sounds we hear convey meaning.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.190
With two ears, we can locate a sounds direction.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:40.140
Different wave lengths of light are perceived as a range of vivid colors.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:49.140
Images from each eye combine in 3D so that we can better judge depth and distance.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:59.539
We can detect over 10,000 smells by using a small group of cells that detect microscopic materials in the air.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:09.040
We taste, see, smell, touch, and hear in one enjoyable experience.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.040
All the senses converging in one place are brain.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.040
Some 200 billion nerve cells connected by trillions of tiny contacts.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.040
The brain interprets chemical signals from each sense,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.040
connects new information to what we already know and stores lasting memories.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.040
Life is a precious gift from our loving creator.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
King David was inspired to write.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.040
I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way, I am wonderfully made.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.040
Your works are wonderful.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.040
I know this very well.
