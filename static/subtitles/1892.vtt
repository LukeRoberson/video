00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:05.419
Were you hoping this pandemic would be over by now?

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.419
I think we all were.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.419
In some places, the number of new cases is low.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.419
But in other parts of the world, highly contagious variants

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.420
are spreading and the pandemic is raging like never before.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.420
It's a sobering reminder that this pandemic is not over.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.420
We weep with those who weep.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.420
And we pray especially for our brothers and sisters

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.420
in Latin America and Africa,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.420
where there's been quite an increase of cases in recent weeks.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420
In other parts of the world,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.420
vaccinations have slowed the spread of the virus.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
We're doing what we can to help

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.420
to help Bethelites and other special full-time servants

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.420
get vaccinated if they want to be.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.420
We're happy to report that about 50% of the worldwide

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.420
Bethel family have been vaccinated so far.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.420
Here in the United States, more than 98% of our Bethel family

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.420
have chosen to get vaccinated.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.420
New York state regulations now allow vaccinated persons

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.420
to engage in a greater number of activities.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.420
In harmony with those government regulations,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.420
we've been able to resume some of our activities within Bethel.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.420
The family was delighted that government regulations

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.420
allowed those who are vaccinated to assemble.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.420
That means we could come together for meals in our dining rooms

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.420
and for Bethel family watch-star study.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.420
We're all glad to be back together here again.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.420
What a happy day that was to assemble again

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420
for the watch-star study.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.420
Of course, the decision to be vaccinated is a personal one.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.420
What factors might a Christian consider

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.419
in making the decision?

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.419
Number one, as Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:15.419
we do not have a religious objection

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.419
to vaccination.

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.419
Number two, we're in the midst of a pandemic

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:27.419
as of July 9 over 19,000 of our dear brothers and sisters

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:30.419
have died from the virus.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.419
Number three, in some lands,

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.419
the superior authorities have made laws requiring all

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.419
of their citizens to be vaccinated.

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.419
In other lands, the superior authorities have not made laws

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.419
but they are strongly encouraging their citizens

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.419
to be vaccinated.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.419
We each must weigh such factors when making

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.419
our own personal decision.

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.060
Continue to take reasonable precautions

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.060
in accord with local conditions,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.060
especially if you have health problems

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.060
or you're up in years.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.060
Stay in touch with direction coming

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.060
from the local health authorities

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.060
and be careful.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.060
In this update, I'd like to talk with all of you older ones.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.060
I'm an older person myself.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.060
I'm going to turn 87 before too long.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.060
When I was 20 or 30 years old,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.060
I had no idea I'd still be around at 87.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.060
Many of you probably feel the same way.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.060
But here we are now.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.060
And just like Ecclesiastes chapter 12 says,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.060
the days of distress have come.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.060
Our bodies are slowing down.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.060
We've lost the youth we used to have.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.060
We can't see or hear too well.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.060
We've got all kinds of health problems.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.060
And during the pandemic,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.060
we've had to stay shut up in our little old homes

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.060
for a lot longer than we thought we would.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.060
And it may be that one or two of us

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.060
have felt that God has just thrown us away.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.060
That he's just not interested in old people

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.370
after our youth is gone.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.370
We know he's going to take care of us.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.370
We're going to get everlasting life.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.370
But right now,

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.370
we feel like we're kind of on our own.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.370
But I'd like to remind you of something found in the Bible.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.370
You know at one time, most likely,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.370
David thought that Jehovah had left him.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.370
That's the reason why he said what is recorded

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.370
at Psalm 71 verse 9.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.370
Do not cast me off in my old age.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.370
Do not abandon me when my strength fails.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.370
But we know that Jesus mentioned David in his teaching

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.370
because hundreds of years later,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.370
after David's death,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.370
Christ talked about David.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.370
So Jehovah didn't throw him away.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.370
That's for sure.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.370
And he's going to remember David even more in the resurrection.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.370
And he hasn't really thrown any of us away either.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.370
Even though we may feel that he has at times.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.370
How do you know that?

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.370
How do you personally know

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.370
that Jehovah has not thrown you away?

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.370
Well, let's think about it.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.370
How many of you know how old Mathusa was when he died?

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.370
You probably learned that a long time ago.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.370
You know the answer.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.370
He was really old.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.370
The oldest one mentioned among imperfect humans in the Bible.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.370
How many of you know how old Noah was

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.370
when he started to build the ark?

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.370
He was well over 500 years old.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.370
That shows us that God remembers us when we're old.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.370
The Christian Greek scriptures also tell us

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.370
about the prophet of Santa who was 84 years old.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.370
How do we know she was 84 years old?

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.370
It's in the inspired scriptures.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.370
If Jehovah didn't want us to know her age,

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.370
he wouldn't have put it in their hoodie.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.370
Now, doesn't that tell us something?

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.370
Jehovah keeps track of age.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.370
And he's interested in us older ones.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.370
Psalm 90 comes right out and says

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:59.370
that imperfect men live to be maybe 70 or 80 years old.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.370
And even then, those years are filled with trouble.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.370
So Jehovah put all that in there for us to know

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.370
that he has not thrown us away,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.370
that he remembers us.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.370
We're so proud of you.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.370
You have learned to use Zoom and mute and unmute yourself.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.370
I'm still learning to use Zoom.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.370
You've tackled telephone witnessing and letter writing.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.370
It's amazing to see how fast you did it.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.370
Clearly, Jehovah has been with you and has strengthened you.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:46.370
That's what he promises at Psalm 29, 11.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.370
Jehovah will give strength to his people.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.370
Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.370
Through his whole pandemic,

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.370
we've seen evidence that Jehovah has continued to give us strength

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.370
and bless us with peace.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:07.370
That's why nothing has stopped the kingdom work from moving forward.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:12.370
A good example of that is our theocratic construction.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.370
You may be wondering how the pandemic has affected

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.370
that the worldwide construction work.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:25.370
Not to mention all the work normally done to maintain our kingdom halls.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.370
Did everything just stop?

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.370
Well, when the pandemic first hit,

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.370
we did suspend most new construction and renovation

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.370
so that the construction servants and volunteers could shelter in place.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:47.370
Our first concern was the safety of the thousands of volunteers

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.370
working full-time with local design construction.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.370
Of course, many of those brothers and sisters serve far

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.370
from their families and friends,

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.370
so shelter in place hasn't been easy.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:10.370
What has helped them to cope with the loneliness and isolation?

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.370
Listen to their comments in the following video.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:20.220
The brothers organized frequent shepherding visits by video conference.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:27.220
During these visits, they asked me how I was doing physically, emotionally and spiritually.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:33.220
I appreciate so very much that they were thinking about me

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.220
and they chose specific Bible texts to share with me.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.220
During the pandemic, I was assigned a field service group to oversee

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:47.220
and this gave me more opportunities to assist new publishers

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.220
in maintaining good personal Bible study habits

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.220
and also train brothers to reach out for more responsibilities.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.220
I'm not able to visit my family in Europe,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.220
but I often call them and I share encouraging thoughts with them.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.220
I also like helping young ones in the ministry.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.220
It is not easy for them to preach during this pandemic,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.220
but preaching together boosts all of us.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.220
And by giving, I felt Jehovah's blessings.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.220
For example, brothers and sisters have been checking upon my husband and I

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.220
and have been an emotional support during this lockdown.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.220
Without them knowing their texts, calls and other caring deeds

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.889
have made things easier for us.

00:10:31.889 --> 00:10:35.889
Did you notice what helped them maintain a positive outlook?

00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:40.889
Encouraging shepherding visits and the staying busy

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:42.889
with spiritual activities.

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:47.889
So even though they couldn't work as much on branch projects

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:52.889
or build kingdom halls, they could build up their spirituality

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:57.889
and encourage others, and that's exactly what they did.

00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:05.889
Now, we said earlier that most construction had to stop for a while

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:07.889
because of the virus.

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:10.889
But did that mean everything stopped?

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:12.889
Not at all.

00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:18.889
We were able to keep making progress on a number of branch projects.

00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:23.889
One example is the new branch property in Argentina.

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:27.889
The project faced many delays because of the pandemic,

00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:31.889
but with Jehovah's help, our brothers were able to work through

00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:36.889
them with the assistance of contractors.

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:39.889
And now the Bethel family has started to move in,

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:44.889
taking strict precautions against COVID-19.

00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:50.889
They all finish moving in to the new facility in the weeks to come.

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:57.889
But how have our other design and construction teams kept the work moving?

00:11:57.889 --> 00:12:00.889
Let's hear from a few of them.

00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:07.519
The worldwide design construction training desk recognized the opportunity

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:11.519
to sharpen the awareness of safety among all who participate

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:14.519
in theocratic construction and maintenance projects.

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:20.519
So because of this, a safety training course for overseas was rolled out globally.

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:27.519
About 7,500 responsible brothers benefited from this via video conference.

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:35.519
Brother from Belgium said, I now recognize that safety is an extension to my spirituality.

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:40.519
Here in Africa, the pandemic has emphasized the need to better prepare our

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:45.519
kingdom halls in health and hygiene for our brothers and sisters.

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:50.519
Solution such as hand washing stations, limiting physical touch points,

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:55.519
and other hygiene-related needs are being addressed.

00:12:55.519 --> 00:13:02.519
The local design construction departments are also busy planning for future projects

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:08.519
and do any sensual kingdom hall maintenance and repairs.

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:13.519
And in areas where conditions have allowed it, some branches have even been able

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:19.519
to start new projects with a limited number of construction servants.

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:26.519
Our thanks go out to all of you construction volunteers who keep giving generously

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:34.519
of yourselves as you work hard on projects and care for your local kingdom halls.

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:38.519
So what does all of this show us?

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:45.519
Jehovah's chariot has not stopped, and all of us, old and young,

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:48.519
want to keep pace with it.

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:54.519
As we face the days ahead, we'll continue to take a cautious approach

00:13:54.519 --> 00:14:00.519
that shows respect for life and keeps the kingdom work going.

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:07.519
We don't know exactly when this pandemic will end, but we know this.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:15.519
Jehovah will continue to provide the guidance we need to get through it.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:28.059
We want you to know that we love you and pray for Jehovah's blessing on all you do to serve him faithfully.

00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:35.059
