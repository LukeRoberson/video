00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:10.240
Our text today is very encouraging as it reminds us through this example of Amos that Jehovah notices the potential of each one of his servants.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.240
In fact, one of the comments from today's text states,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:23.239
even though we may lack self-confidence, Jehovah can help us go beyond our perceived limits and reach goals that we would not have imagined.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.239
See, Jehovah knows our potential.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:34.240
But you note from that statement, this is also a reminder that we have to put forth effort to reach our potential.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.240
You see, if we're not careful, we can sabotage our own efforts to reach the potential that Jehovah sees in us.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.240
How's that possible? Well, let's look at three examples.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.240
Number one, we can limit potential by not throwing ourselves into what we are asked to do.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.240
We may remember the account of Jehoash, the King of Israel, there in 2nd Kings chapter 13,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:06.239
when he visited the prophet Elisha, who was dying, and you notice there in 2nd Kings chapter 13 and verse 17,

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:10.239
that Elisha notes Jehoash's potential.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:16.239
You notice he says there that you will strike down Syria until you finish it off.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:22.239
See, he noted the potential that he had to finish off Syria, but then what happens?

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:29.239
Well, you remember that's where the King tells the Elisha tells the King to beat the arrows on the ground three times,

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.239
or beat it on the ground, and he only does it three times.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:34.239
Notice what happens in verse 19.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:38.239
At that, the man of the true God grew indignated him and said,

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:46.239
You should have struck the ground five or six times, then you would have struck down Syria until you finished it off.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.239
But now you will strike down Syria only three times.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:55.239
What happened? Well, you see, by not throwing himself into what he was asked to do,

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.239
showing zeal for his assignment, he would only have limited success.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.239
Jehoash limited his own potential.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:11.240
Number two, we can limit our potential by focusing on our inadequacies or our insecurities.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.240
And a count that drives that home for me is that of Moses.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.240
If you look in Exodus chapter three, and in this account, we know it's not due to lack of zeal,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.240
but rather Moses' own insecurities that nearly caused him to limit how he was used by Jehovah.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.240
So we know in Exodus chapter three, he received a very weighty assignment going to Pharaoh,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.240
and notice what happens in verse 11, Exodus three, 11.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.240
It says, however, Moses said to the true God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.240
Now, that's a normal reaction. We probably would have felt the same way. Jehovah, are you sure you have the right person here?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.240
And Jehovah says, No, I do. I will be with you.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.240
You look on verse 13, says, but Moses said to the true God,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.240
Suppose I go to Israel and say to them, the God of your forefathers has sent me to you,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.240
and they say to me, What's his name? What should I say to them?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.240
Jehovah says no problem, and he explains his name even tells him what his name means,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.240
and how that power will be behind him.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.240
Chapter four, in verse one, however, Moses answered,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.240
But suppose they do not believe me, and they do not listen to my voice,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.240
for they'll say Jehovah did not appear to you. No problem, Moses, what's in your hand?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.240
So where he has the staff, he shows him miracles that he can perform to show that Jehovah is behind him.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.240
Look at verse 10.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.240
Moses now said to Jehovah, Pardon me, Jehovah, but I have never been a fluent speaker,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.240
neither in the past nor since you spoken to your servant, where I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.240
Okay, Moses, who created the mouth? I'll speak for you. Don't worry about it.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.240
Look at verse 13.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.240
But he says pardon me, Jehovah, please send anyone whom you want to send.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.240
And notice what says in verse 14.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.240
Then Jehovah's anger blazed against Moses.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.240
Fine, you know, I'm going to just send somebody else.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.240
But thankfully, Moses got the point and he jumped into the assignment,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.240
who's used further by Jehovah. But what happened here?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.240
You notice Moses got caught up worrying about his inadequacies,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.240
worrying about all the things that could go wrong.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.240
Jehovah is saying just get moving and I will take care of the rest.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.240
And Jehovah saw that Moses had the potential to carry out this assignment.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.240
However, Moses was limiting himself.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.240
At number three, we can limit our own potential by becoming paralyzed by fear.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.240
Fear of failure. If you turn to the account in numbers, chapter 13,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.240
we notice that this is what happened to the 10 spies.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.240
It's very interesting a phrase they use when they came back from spying out the land.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.240
Number, chapter 13, and look at verse 33.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.939
It says, and there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of anach who are from the Nephilim.

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:08.939
And in comparison, we seem like grasshoppers and notice both to us and to them.

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.939
You see, they ran into these sons of anach who were giants,

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.939
men of extraordinary size, who inhabited the mountainous region of Canaan.

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.939
And it was understandable that these enemies of Jehovah view the Israelites as puny,

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.939
grasshoppers, you can just squash them and no competition.

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.939
But you know, the 10 spies saw themselves the same way.

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.939
And see, their view of themselves and the situation paralyzed them with fear

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:36.939
and caused them to demoralize the entire nation.

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:39.939
But now, in contrast, we think of the account of David,

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.939
who has a young man also encountered a giant Goliath.

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:47.939
And remember, Goliath also saw David as a dispenseless little boy

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.939
and as a grasshopper, if you will.

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:52.939
But did David see himself the same way?

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:55.939
Now, he says, you're coming to me with sword and spear.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.939
I'm coming to you with the name of Jehovah.

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.939
You see, David did not allow himself to be paralyzed by fear.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:08.939
He trusted in Jehovah and David lived up to the potential that Jehovah saw in him.

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:11.939
So what's the lesson for us?

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.939
Well, the lesson is, is this illustrate, these accounts illustrate,

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.939
that sometimes we can be our own worst enemy of times.

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:21.939
See, lack of zeal, not throwing ourselves into the work as in the case of Jehoash

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:27.939
or our own insecurities as in the case of Moses or fear of failure

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.939
as in the case of the 10 spies can cause us to limit the potential

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:34.939
that Jehovah sees in us.

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:36.939
So what do we do?

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.939
Well, Jehovah's words to Gideon remind us of what we can do.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.939
And we invite you to turn to judges chapter six.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:50.939
And you remember that for seven years, the Midianites oppressed the nation of Israel.

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:54.939
And Jehovah's angel appears to Gideon, says that he's going to deliver Israel

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:56.939
out of this wicked nation.

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.939
How could he possibly succeed?

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:02.939
We read the accounting Gideon saw himself as the least significant one of his father's house.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:06.939
And he said to his father's house was the least significant family of the tribe of Manasseh.

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:10.939
But yet Jehovah saw the potential that Gideon had.

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:14.939
And what did Jehovah tell him to do?

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:18.939
Look at judges chapter six and verse 14.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:22.939
It says, Jehovah faced him and said,

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:26.939
Go with the strength you have.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:28.939
And you will save Israel out of Midian's hand.

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.939
Is it not I who sent you?

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:34.939
Interesting.

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.939
Go with the strength you have.

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:38.939
I know you cannot do it on your own strength.

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:40.939
Just get moving.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:42.939
Throw everything you can into it.

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:46.939
And I, Jehovah, will make up the difference.

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:48.939
See, that's what Jehovah is saying.

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:50.939
And that's exactly what happened.

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:54.939
So may we be determined to do the same.

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:58.939
We know that none of us accomplished Jehovah's work on our own strength,

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:00.939
on our own wisdom, on our own abilities.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.939
But when we receive an assignment,

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:04.939
we need to just start moving.

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:08.939
Do not let our inadequacies paralyze us.

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:12.939
Do not let fear of failure paralyze us.

00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:14.939
Throw ourselves into the work. Have a zeal for the work.

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:18.939
Go with the strength that you have.

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:22.939
Trust in Jehovah to make up the difference.

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:24.939
And you will live up to the potential

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:26.939
that Jehovah sees in you.
