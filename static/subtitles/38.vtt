00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:08.089
Welcome to another edition of J.W. Broadcasting. Have you ever felt discouraged

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:14.130
due to circumstances beyond your control? We'll discuss how we can still have

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.030
joy despite our limitations and we'll see examples both biblical and modern

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.109
day that will encourage us to keep giving Jehovah our best. Jonah faced

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.770
several reasons to become discouraged and give up. How did Jehovah help him

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.009
carry on with courage and faith? And what lessons from his experience can we

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:45.210
apply to problems we face today? Can we change our personality for the better?

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.049
We can with Jehovah's spirit and diligent effort. This brother describes how

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:57.530
far his personality and lifestyle took him away from Jehovah. He explains how

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.250
he regained a clean conscience and freeness of speech. Jehovah can turn

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.489
tragic events caused by man into open doors of activity for his loyal witnesses.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:14.689
In this report from Greece we'll learn how our brothers are bringing

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:25.370
spiritual comfort to refugees. You're watching the June 2017 edition of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:50.549
There are many exciting things happening in Jehovah's organization. On month

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.629
after month we read articles, watch videos and hear personal experiences

00:01:55.629 --> 00:02:00.629
about our brothers and sisters who are doing more for Jehovah. They are serving

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:05.069
with Anita's greater or reaching out for the school for Kingdom of Angelizers.

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.650
They are working on construction, renovation, maintenance of Kingdom Halls or

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.189
other Theocratic projects. Note out many of you watching this program are

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:22.270
excitedly looking forward to expanding your ministry in one of these areas. We

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.270
encourage you to do so. You can be assured that you will receive much fulfillment and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.830
many blessings from Jehovah. On the other hand, there are others who are

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.030
watching this program who may feel discouraged because their circumstances may

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.430
seem to limit their being involved as they would like. What are some of these

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.710
circumstances? These may include our age, our health, our economic situation, or

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:59.550
physical limitations. For some of us, perhaps our upbringing, or past errors we

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.069
have made in our life, may cause us to feel that we are limited as to what we

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.030
can do for Jehovah. As we know well, focusing on our limitations can affect our

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.949
joy, causing discouragement. What can we do? There are many examples in the

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:22.870
scriptures of men and women who had circumstances beyond their control that

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.229
seemed to limit how much they could do for Jehovah. Others had to deal with the

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:34.590
effects of their upbringing and family life, or with serious errors they may.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.150
Did they allow themselves to be limited by their circumstances or their past?

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.469
How did Jehovah feel about them? How does Jehovah feel about us? That is what we

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:52.310
are going to discuss in this month's broadcast, which has the theme, are you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.270
defined by your circumstances? Let's start by looking at some who could have

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.710
let their circumstances limit them. Consider first the example of Joseph in the

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.469
book of Genesis. Now Joseph faced injustice at its worst. In his situation was

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.750
especially hurtful since it was initially brought on by those who should have

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.910
been closest to him, his family. As a slave in Egypt and later as a prisoner,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.709
Joseph was indeed limited in what he could do. How might Joseph have reacted?

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:33.670
Well, Joseph could have become so preoccupied with what he could not do that he

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.550
lost sight of what he could do. Did Joseph let his circumstances paralyze his

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.790
life? No. He chose to make the best of his situation. In fact, note what

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.870
Joseph did while serving as a slave in Potiphar's house if we turn together to

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.230
Genesis chapter 39 and verse 4. Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes and he

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.629
became his personal attendant. So we appointed him over his house and he put him

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:11.189
in charge of all that was his. Joseph worked diligently within the limitations

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:16.269
of his circumstances. He took a similar approach while in prison. At Joseph

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:23.269
focused on what he could do despite suffering the effects of injustice. As a

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:28.230
second example, consider Hezekiah. Now, Hezekiah is one who might easily have

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.829
felt that he was defined by his upbringing. Look at the terrible example that was

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:42.870
set by his father, Ahaz, as recorded in 2 Kings, chapter 16. 2 Kings, chapter 16,

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:50.709
and notice what verse 3 says about Ahaz. Instead, he walked in the way of the

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:57.069
kings of Israel and he even made his own son pass through the fire following the

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:02.350
detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:10.230
Israelites. Hezekiah's father did detestable things in opposition to Jehovah but

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.790
Hezekiah showed that he was not the helpless victim of a poor parental

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:21.389
example. What did he do? Well, turn in your Bibles to 2 Kings chapter 18 and

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.769
notice verse 3 what it says about Hezekiah. He kept doing what was right in

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:36.350
Jehovah's eyes. Just as David his forefather had done. Verse 5 says of Hezekiah,

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.430
there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah. He became fully

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.850
involved in true worship. Verses 6 and 7 says that Hezekiah held fast to

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:55.209
Jehovah and Jehovah proved to be with him. How encouraging. Hezekiah's example

00:06:55.209 --> 00:07:00.089
is for us. We can choose to be loyal to Jehovah and do much in our worship of

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:06.170
Jehovah even if we did not grow up in a family that served Jehovah fully. We

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:12.290
are not helpless victims of our environment. Hezekiah's example reassures us

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.009
that our past does not have to control our future. As a third example,

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:24.250
consider the Apostle Paul. He did not let his own past mistakes involving

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:31.209
religious prejudice and violence stop him from giving his all to Jehovah. How did

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:36.329
Paul feel about his past? Well, let's read together in 1 Corinthians chapter

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:44.889
15 and verse 9. For I am the least of the Apostles, and I am not worthy of

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:51.610
being called an Apostle because I persecuted the congregation of God. I am the

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.370
least of the Apostle. Later when writing to the Ephesians, as recorded Ephesians

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.970
chapter 3 and verse 8, he calls himself less than the least of all the holy

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:07.050
ones. Finally, at 1 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 15, he now calls himself the

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:13.569
foremost of all sinners. Yes, Paul's prior treatment of the congregation weighed

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:19.889
heavily upon him. Could Paul have reasoned that he was damaged? Could he have

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:25.050
reasoned that his past limited what he could do for Jehovah? He could have,

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:30.689
but Paul did not do that. He poured himself out for the congregation. Why Paul was

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:34.049
privileged to write more books and letters in the Christian Greek

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:38.289
scriptures than anyone else? He demonstrated an outstanding zeal for the

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:44.610
ministry. Paul did not let his conduct in the past dictate what he could do

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:51.210
for Jehovah. And there are many other examples as well. For example, are we in a

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:56.929
difficult economic situation? The account of 2 Corinthians chapter 8 tells us

00:08:56.929 --> 00:09:03.210
about the Macedonians. Paul says that they were in deep poverty, yet they begged

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:10.009
to have a financial share in the relief work. Are we older in years? We may think

00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:16.809
of Anna. The account in Luke chapter 2 verses 36 to 38 tells us as she was 84

00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:22.690
years old and that her husband had died after just seven years of marriage. Yes,

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.169
she was never missing from the temple. She rendered sacred service day and

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:34.570
night. What lessons do we learn from these accounts? Our dear brothers and

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.769
sisters in Bible times were just like us. Many were in circumstances that they

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:45.490
would not have chosen, yet they did not let their circumstances or their past

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:51.570
to find them. They joyfully did what they could within the limits of their

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:57.210
situation. And these are just a few examples. There are many others in the Bible.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:03.330
Why not make it a personal study project to research faithful ones who are in

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:10.330
circumstances similar to yours? How did they stay involved in Jehovah's work? We

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:16.330
are sure that you will be greatly encouraged. In fact, let's look at an example

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:21.169
of how you might do this with a familiar Bible character. In this

00:10:21.169 --> 00:10:27.289
dramatization, a brother and two sisters used their personal study time to learn

00:10:27.289 --> 00:10:33.370
about Jonah. Sometimes, as we know, Jonah was discouraged by events beyond his

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:39.970
control. At other times, it was because of his own failings. Does Jonah's

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:45.169
experience relate to what they are feeling? And how do the lessons Jonah learn

00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:49.850
help them to not remain trapped in their circumstances?

00:10:49.850 --> 00:11:03.330
But John, they're still plenty you can do in the congregation. Sure, that

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:09.610
sounds good, but I'm no longer a ministerial servant. Why did I let my zeal

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:19.289
for the ministry call off? I know what the brothers must think of me now. Hello?

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:26.210
Oh, good morning. My name's Jane. How are you? Not bad, thanks. I know you may not be

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:32.769
interested, but I have this track that I'd like to... You may not be interested. Where did that come from?

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:40.629
Not my best presentation, but it didn't seem like she wanted to talk more

00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:49.529
anyway. Well, what does that mean? It may be manageable, but long-term, given

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:52.429
your other conditions, you're looking at positive.

00:11:52.429 --> 00:12:20.200
Magical? Long-term? Oh, Jehovah, how can I do this by myself? Of course, Jehovah values you.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:27.080
Try to think of someone in the Bible who may have felt like you do. Like Jonah.

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:45.879
Jonah felt like I do. What comes to your mind when you think of Jonah? Do you think of him as a

00:12:45.879 --> 00:13:06.179
disobedient prophet? Reluctant to obey Jehovah's command, Jonah ordered a ship that carried him farther

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:25.409
and farther away from his assignment. The Jonah's recent actions disqualify him from ever again

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:40.000
serving God in an official capacity. He sure could have thought so. I know I do. No,

00:13:41.039 --> 00:14:03.669
Jehovah mercifully and lovingly renewed the prophet's commission. So if Jehovah didn't see Jonah

00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:17.399
as a total failure, then what must he think of me? 1 Samuel 16 verse 7. For the way man sees

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:53.480
is not the way God sees. Jonah did not see Nineveh as Jehovah did, with all they were doing,

00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:00.919
how could he view them any differently? But the account says, when God saw they had turned back

00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:09.320
from their evil ways, he reconsidered the calamity and he did not bring it. Despite the people's

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:17.879
badness, Jehovah cared about them. He values human life and the potential that each individual has

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:27.409
for repenting and learning to do what is right. Well of course that's true. Why didn't Jonah see that?

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:39.759
But am I seeing people the way Jehovah does? Am I assuming they won't listen and then not giving my

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:49.559
best? How can I know how a personal respond? Jonah learned to be merciful.

00:15:50.519 --> 00:16:05.830
Will we? Matthew 5 verse 7 says, happy are the merciful. Since they will be shown mercy,

00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:15.240
then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the belly of the fish and he said,

00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:25.080
out of my distress, I call that to Jehovah and he answered me, out of the depths of the grave,

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:35.990
I cried for help. You heard my voice. God heard Jonah and delivered him.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:49.269
But I can't expect a miracle. Then my prayer came into you, into your holy temple.

00:16:49.269 --> 00:17:00.580
My prayer came into you. Jonah didn't know if Jehovah would rescue him,

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:09.700
but he prayed in faith that Jehovah cared. But as for me, with the voice of thanksgiving,

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:18.339
I will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed, I will pay. Salvation is from Jehovah.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:38.440
As long as I still can, I'll keep sacrificing to God. Salvation is from Jehovah.

00:17:44.599 --> 00:17:48.839
Like those in our video, do you sometimes feel as Jonah did?

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:55.799
Can you apply the lessons from Jonah's account to better see God's mercy in your life?

00:17:57.079 --> 00:18:03.000
A personal failing discouraged our brother. But like Jonah, he realized,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.240
Jehovah still valued him. Our young sister reinvigorated her ministry

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.559
after meditating on the way Jehovah mercifully viewed the ininivites.

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:23.079
And our sister was determined to imitate Jonah's faith that God hears our prayers about circumstances

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:31.799
beyond our control. Sometimes, however, our circumstances are only perceived barriers to doing

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:38.039
more for Jehovah. For example, some may feel limited by economic concerns if they reach out for

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:44.440
special privileges. In the Netherlands, many brothers and sisters assisted with the

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:50.599
construction of the Swifterbont assembly hall. Some had to make adjustments to be able to work on

00:18:50.599 --> 00:18:57.160
this project. Listen, however, to their comments on the blessings they received and what their

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:06.849
goals are, now that the project is completed. In the Netherlands, there was a need for a new

00:19:06.849 --> 00:19:12.289
suitable assembly hall, which could accommodate almost all of the 300 congregations of Jehovah's

00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:20.150
witnesses. Additional building ground was acquired next to the existing hall, so that a second

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:29.730
completely new hall could be constructed. More than 200 volunteers worked on this project.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.730
What challenges did they face? And what blessings did they receive?

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:47.220
We had to sell our house and close our business. It's a step in the unknown.

00:19:48.819 --> 00:19:55.700
I had to quit my job. It was exciting to step out of my comfort zone and rely completely on

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:03.220
Jehovah. Everything is structured organized. That is why things run smoothly. That doesn't come

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:10.740
naturally to me. We were invited to come and work in the kitchen. I love to cook at home.

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:15.299
I'm really fond of it. What was my assignment? Doing the dishes.

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:32.319
Working on yourself, your Christian personality, and cooperating with your brothers and sisters,

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:40.880
that has everlasting value. This was a wonderful training for the future when we will be building

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:47.359
together in paradise. They realize that everyone sacrifices something and becomes happy. No one regrets

00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:53.440
that decision. Jehovah takes into account your personal makeup that he is patient with us.

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:59.359
I've really learned how to work together in a theoretical arrangement and still have fun.

00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:06.200
You can work on yourself all day long and therefore be able to improve.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.079
I really learned to study more to read the Bible more often.

00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:17.640
Because we work together so closely, you get to know each other very well,

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:26.549
and I really started to love and appreciate people. We really came to appreciate that every

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:38.559
brother and sister has this beautiful inner person. Visitors or contractors were always very

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:41.519
surprised that there were so many women working at the construction site.

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:48.319
It's great working with sisters. I have construction background and communication with men can be

00:21:48.319 --> 00:21:54.799
really upfront. That doesn't work with sisters. You just have to become, talk, and listen.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:11.380
I had to work on a lift platform, but I was kind of a problem because I'm afraid of heights.

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:16.900
The brothers were so kind to seal the sides up completely so that I could not look down.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.500
It was fun working together on that lift platform. We called it our little flat.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.380
The atmosphere was amazing and we all had a great time.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.680
Now we work in the kitchen at the Sviftuvanskul facility.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.519
A real privilege. We have been trained to cook during construction,

00:22:42.519 --> 00:22:44.920
but if needed, I'll even do the dishes as well.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.720
I'll never work five days again. Now I work three days and since you live first,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.039
I started by an eerie. That's just great.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.920
He was offered a job. He could even choose between two jobs.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.480
Now he works three days a week, which always seemed impossible.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.680
Eventually, we were in Sviftuvanskul for one month only.

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:11.279
Then we went to Mozambique for three months.

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:13.440
Then for five months to Sviftuvanskul again.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.880
Then three months out there for care.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.799
And the visit for us and the battle called and assigned us to Kongo Kinshasa.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:44.119
All the volunteers who helped to make a success of this project, well, they had to give up a lot.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.519
As a result, we can enjoy this beautiful hall.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.279
It's amazing to be here. It's great to be encouraged and to be strengthened for the ministry.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:02.160
If you think about it, every day we have around 700 new brothers and sisters.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.640
That means every three days we can fill a hall like this with new brothers and sisters.

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:12.480
These kind of halls are really needed worldwide in order to provide education to all those

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.000
additional brothers and sisters.

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:19.039
It's so face strengthening to be here.

00:24:20.079 --> 00:24:25.599
Words cannot express it. I feel so united, so warm, peaceful.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.240
It's so wonderful to be able to serve Jehovah together.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.759
Did you notice a comment thread in the volunteers' comments?

00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:52.960
Any economic concerns they may have had just faded in the background, didn't they?

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.839
They reached out to help, and in turn, Jehovah helped them.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.480
In fact, the assembly hall project was finished at a lower cost and a year earlier than originally plan.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.319
And did you note that after the project, some who previously felt they couldn't pioneer,

00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:15.759
reduced their secular work days, and are now doing what they thought was out of reach?

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:22.559
It brings us joy to see so many making adjustments and reaching out to do more

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:28.960
for the organization. And in turn, they experienced something they'll never forget.

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:36.480
Now, we've considered examples of those who did not let their circumstances hinder them

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:44.240
from giving the role to Jehovah. But another question is, how does Jehovah view his faithful

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:50.480
servants despite their limitations? I've often thought about the example of John the Baptizer.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.960
As we know, he was arrested shortly after Jesus started his ministry.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.200
John could have felt that he was no longer of use to Jehovah or the work.

00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:07.279
Yet, as recorded at Matthew 11 verse 11, Jesus said about John,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:14.160
among those born of women, there has not been raised up anyone greater than John the Baptist.

00:26:15.119 --> 00:26:21.119
Jehovah's and Jesus' view of John was not based on the man's circumstances of being in prison.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.839
Their view of John was based on who he was on the inside and on his relationship with Jehovah.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.720
Jehovah did not focus on the limitations. In Jehovah's eyes, John was great.

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:41.599
He was still a faithful servant doing the best that he could, and that was all that really matter.

00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:49.119
Another example that may come to your mind is that of King David. As we know, King David committed

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:56.880
serious sins. Yet David repented for his sins, and there is no record that he repeated them.

00:26:58.319 --> 00:27:06.559
How did Jehovah view him? Did Jehovah see David as damaged as a man who would always be limited

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:16.079
in serving him? Notice Jehovah's words directed to King Jeroboan at 1 Kings chapter 14 and verse 8.

00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:24.319
But you have not become like my servant, David, who kept my commandments and who walked after me

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:32.160
with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes. Jehovah viewed David as a special servant.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:39.519
He says, he kept my commandments. He did what was right in my eyes. That's what Jehovah remembered.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:47.039
How encouraging that is for us. If we have repented of our past mistakes and set matters

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:54.400
straight to the best of our circumstances, we too can be assured that Jehovah loves us dearly.

00:27:55.119 --> 00:27:59.039
He appreciates whatever we can do in our worship of him.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:09.119
So what's the point? Well, our past or our present circumstances do not define our value before

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:17.119
Jehovah. Our father loves us for who we are and he values our efforts as we do the best that we

00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:24.960
can to serve him. Why do you think it is important that we strive to see ourselves as Jehovah does?

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:33.599
Because we can weaken, discourage or limit ourselves if we see ourselves only in the framework

00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:43.279
of our circumstances. May we work hard not to do that. What does Jehovah see when he looks at his

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:52.079
faithful servants today? Well, turn please to 1 Samuel chapter 16 and verse 7. And the setting

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.359
is Samuel was about to go to anoint the next king of Israel and he goes to the house of Jesse and

00:28:57.359 --> 00:29:02.880
Jesse lines up all of his sons except David who was still out in the field and Samuel walks in and

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:10.960
he sees a lie out. And based on what he sees, Samuel concludes that this surely must be the next

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:20.000
king of Israel. Yet note what Jehovah saw. Please read with me. First Samuel chapter 16 and verse 7.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:27.359
But Jehovah said to Samuel, do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is

00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:36.640
where I have rejected him. For the way man sees is not the way God sees because mere man sees what

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:45.519
appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart. That's the way Jehovah sees. He does not

00:29:45.519 --> 00:29:50.799
look at our outward appearance and our abilities. He sees into our heart. He sees what we would be

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:57.039
doing if all the limitations were lifted off of us. Why just the fact that we keep going, that we

00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:05.039
keep putting one foot in front of another, endears us to Jehovah? We understand the truth of that

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:13.279
statement and we all may agree that this is how Jehovah views his people. However, we may have a hard

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:22.240
time convincing ourselves if this really applies to me. Have you ever wondered does Jehovah really see

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:30.960
me? Does he see what's in my heart and value my desire to do more for him? The answer is yes. In

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:40.000
fact, Jehovah has already seen what is in your heart. Think about this. Why are you watching this

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.079
program? But why do you care about spiritual things? Why are you perhaps the only one in your

00:30:46.079 --> 00:30:52.079
family who is a dedicated baptized servant of Jehovah? Or why are you perhaps the only one in your

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:58.640
place of employment or the only one near where you live who's serving Jehovah? Is it because you're

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:07.519
so much more studious or smarter than everyone else? No. Agai chapter 2 and verse 7 tells us that

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:13.279
Jehovah will shake all the nations and the precious things of the nations will come in.

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:23.839
John chapter 6 verse 44 says that no man can come to Jesus unless the Father draws him.

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:30.640
Jeremiah chapter 31 verse 3. Jehovah says, I have loved you

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:39.200
with an everlasting love. That is why I have drawn you. So again, why are you serving Jehovah?

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:46.960
Because Jehovah loves you. Jehovah drew you as he was shaking the nations. He looked down into your

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:52.960
heart and he saw something very precious and he drew you to him. He says, I want to draw this

00:31:52.960 --> 00:32:01.619
person to my son. I want to draw this person to me. I love this person. Jehovah drew you,

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:08.099
not because you had perfect circumstances, but because of your heart and because he loves you.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:16.819
He greatly appreciates that his servants give their best to him. But how do we know that Jehovah

00:32:16.819 --> 00:32:25.380
really sees each one of us no matter where we are? Consider an example. Thousands of refugees

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:31.299
who face severe hardships in their home countries have sought shelter in parts of Europe.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:39.779
Watch how Jehovah has lovingly assured them that they're not alone by satisfying their spiritual

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:52.180
thirst. Welcome to Greece. We really feel that Jehovah is blessing us by opening a large door

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:58.740
of opportunities to preach the good news to the many refugees who are straining into the country.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:07.640
For this reason, the brothers immediately informed us of the situation and we directed the

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:14.279
bodies of elders to concentrate on the harbours, especially in chaos. The brothers were willing

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:25.119
to work in shifts 24 hours a day. The refugee shelters in our area have only families with

00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:31.440
children and are located near a military airport. Whenever military planes flew overhead and the

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.960
children would see and hear them, they would immediately run and try to hide because they were afraid.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.680
They sought protection from the tragic conditions they had experienced during warfare.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.000
This impressed upon us how greatly they needed the comforting message of the good news,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
so we felt the urge to approach them.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:57.039
Therefore, the service department arranged for four language classes to be held for the brothers.

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:04.799
We try to speak to people in a language quite different from our own. At times we might think,

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:10.079
will these people understand us? Will we be able to reach their heart with these basic truths?

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:17.280
Something that helped me not to hesitate to approach these people despite the language barrier

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.239
is what our teachers told us in the language class. Go and talk to them, show them things from

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:26.000
the Bible. Even if you don't say things perfectly, they will understand you.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.400
After we received permission from the branch office, we also printed thousands of

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.760
tracks since we did not have enough. This whole effort created an atmosphere of enthusiasm.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:45.489
I am deeply moved when I see how lovingly Jehovah cares for these people,

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:50.769
who have never had the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message that gives them a future and a hope.

00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:59.010
It was exciting for them to hear that we have a Bible-based video in their language.

00:35:00.289 --> 00:35:05.570
We told them that the problems, calamities, and the terrible war they had experienced

00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:11.170
were not punishment from God, but the result of the influence Satan that devil exercises

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:15.250
over this system of things. And this provided a good answer to their question.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:23.010
On a return visit, after two days, a refugee girl said something very touching.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:28.530
Now I understand why we have to go through all this. It's very difficult, but it's not God's fault.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:34.690
On another occasion, Gardiniya, a refugee woman who showed interest told us,

00:35:34.769 --> 00:35:38.849
since meeting you, I have a purpose in life. I have a reason to live,

00:35:38.849 --> 00:35:48.929
until now I was just waiting to die. A refugee approached the Arabic witnessing cart and we

00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:54.769
read Revelation 21 and 4 to him. He said, please, could you read that to me once again?

00:35:54.769 --> 00:35:59.489
So we read it a second time. He replied, may I have a Bible of my own?

00:35:59.489 --> 00:36:05.250
So we gave him a Bible. Then he said, would you please show me the sentence you read in my Bible?

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:11.170
So we marked the verse for him. And on the way back to our home at about 11 o'clock at night,

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:17.170
on the same road at a well-lit point, we saw that same refugee sitting on the sidewalk reading the Bible.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.920
About two and a half years ago, I met Mustafa. He attended the meetings and made speedy progress.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.519
Mustafa was baptized a few months before the refugees started pouring in. We do not believe

00:36:31.519 --> 00:36:36.800
that this was a coincidence. He would say, I want to speak about Jehovah, but I can't do that

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:45.039
in the Greek language. When I can speak to people who are refugees, just as I am a refugee,

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:52.559
in my own language, this is a great opportunity for me. And when I see that they listen to the truth

00:36:52.559 --> 00:37:00.719
and are loving it, it makes my heart beat faster. It touches my heart. By expanding my ministry,

00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:05.119
I'm sharing in a form of service that could even be described as missionary work,

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:10.239
since I'm helping people hear about Jehovah for the very first time. I'm living what I have

00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:19.360
only read about in experiences. Many were, perhaps, for the first time, discovering new skills in

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:26.159
themselves, indicating how Jehovah, through his spirit, can enable certain ones to cultivate

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:34.360
qualities they didn't realize they had to search an extent. We are so grateful to Jehovah

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.639
for opening a door leading to such wonderful activity. It gives us great joy and we praise

00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:50.440
him daily for this. At the time, this report was prepared over 100 Bible studies have been started.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.280
One refugee told the brothers, you are the best thing that has happened to us here in Greece.

00:37:57.239 --> 00:38:04.760
We thank Jehovah for meeting you. Another said, we do not need material things. We need hope

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:10.760
and you are giving this to us through the Bible. In our program, we have been discussing how

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:17.639
Jehovah values each one of us, no matter what our circumstances are. In some parts of the world,

00:38:17.639 --> 00:38:23.480
our brothers and sisters are in deep poverty and lack even the basic needs for life.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.159
But this does not diminish Jehovah's feelings for them. He loves them dearly.

00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:36.280
In this next report, see what's been done to care for faithful brothers and sisters

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.920
in the democratic republic of Congo.

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:53.440
My name is Masca Mahamba. I love the preaching work. However, my various illnesses prevent me from

00:38:53.519 --> 00:39:00.800
giving my all in the ministry. My first wife died and we had six children.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:10.159
I was alone with the six children and then I married Beatrice, who has five children.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.639
Since we are living in the last days of this system, it is not easy.

00:39:18.639 --> 00:39:25.360
I like the example of Jesus who is passionate about preaching the message that he shared.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:31.519
But at the same time, he took into account the suffering of the people of his time.

00:39:31.519 --> 00:39:36.320
He would take time to show kindness, to encourage and to heal.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:43.679
The branch sees where there is a need and then organizes a humanitarian mission.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.719
I believe I can use my medical skills to help our brothers.

00:39:52.239 --> 00:39:56.960
It is love. Not just inviting, but in action.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.519
It's a real joy to help these brothers who need us in remote locations, far from town.

00:40:03.519 --> 00:40:41.960
It is always a pleasure.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.880
Both the two are the same. Both the drums are completely perforated.

00:41:08.929 --> 00:41:13.250
Well, we are here in the village of Wali Khaled, in the middle of the forest.

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:17.969
On the main road, well, the only road in the village, it serves as our own.

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:26.610
I can't bear to see anyone suffer. So I use all my skills to try to find a solution.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:32.130
What moves me to help the brothers is what Jesus said,

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:35.650
that there is more happiness in giving than in receiving.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:39.730
A long day, really, very tiring.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:42.530
But at the same time, there was an encouraging case.

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:48.130
Brother Minya Karaguay, 68 years old, 10 years in regular per-near service,

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.449
and he has 15 Bible studies.

00:41:50.449 --> 00:41:53.650
This brother came from the territory on the motorcycle.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:57.570
He took him two and a half hours on a very rough road,

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:01.969
instead of an hour and a half, because he has a paralyzed leg.

00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:06.449
And he was able to go back to his field service, well, with some medication.

00:42:06.449 --> 00:42:11.650
So it was really encouraging to see him getting on the motorcycle with a smile on his face.

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:26.639
These are mosquito nets for those in need, and there's a big need here.

00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:28.159
So we give them to each family.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:35.840
You know, to protect your baby, one of the best things is for him to sleep under a mosquito net.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:42.420
Jehovah has done well, because he has gone through you to provide us with care.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:47.300
We are very grateful. We thank the many brothers who have volunteered to service.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:54.260
I thank Jehovah, because without him, our identifying mark of unity wouldn't exist.

00:42:55.219 --> 00:42:59.300
You have helped me. I had this problem for two years.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.940
Now I'm so happy. I will be able to hear at the meetings again. Thank you.

00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:07.460
The brothers are aware that they must thank Jehovah,

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.980
and we ourselves are aware that all of this is possible.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.860
Thanks to Jehovah's Holy Spirit and his organization.

00:43:42.869 --> 00:43:48.150
How heartwarming. Those dear ones are not defined by their circumstances.

00:43:48.789 --> 00:43:52.389
They have been serving Jehovah whole soul despite their challenges.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:58.230
And they're determined to use the relief assistance to continue worshipping him.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:06.389
Earlier, we discussed the examples of King David and the Apostle Paul and the mistakes they made.

00:44:07.269 --> 00:44:11.829
Perhaps for us, our past mistakes are keeping us from moving forward.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:19.030
That was a challenge for Jim Lloyd. He was raised in the truth, but did not progress to baptism.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:25.349
By his teen years, he was getting into trouble, as he describes it, in his heart,

00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:31.429
he had left Jehovah. His later involvement with gangs and violence put him in a place he never

00:44:31.429 --> 00:44:37.110
expected to be. But you will be greatly encouraged to see where he is now.

00:44:38.949 --> 00:44:43.829
Things that have happened to you can't change, but your personality you can,

00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:50.070
we can't change our personality with Jehovah's help. By the time I was 25, I was

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:57.110
associating with notorious criminals. I guess I was criminal too. This took a wrong turn and

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:05.989
kept going. I found myself a fugitive on the run. I was sentenced to many years in prison.

00:45:07.269 --> 00:45:10.389
In 25, I felt like you might as well have been a life sentence.

00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:19.909
The isolation locked down, very lonely place, and I thought, how did I get here?

00:45:22.449 --> 00:45:27.329
I remember a happier time in my life. My mom would take us to meetings.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:34.050
You know, I was in the Democratic Ministry School. All the friends were so loving.

00:45:36.019 --> 00:45:42.340
My mom sent me subscriptions to the watchtower in Wake. I had a box under my bunk.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:49.940
And I tossed them in there, never opened them, and I must have had a year's worth.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:46:00.469
You know, I never told her, stop sending a mom. I'm not reading them. I found out through my mom

00:46:00.469 --> 00:46:12.579
that my dad had died. I felt that I broke his heart. I pulled out the box from under my bunk.

00:46:13.539 --> 00:46:19.380
Right on top was a book. The truth that leads to eternal life.

00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:28.789
And at that moment, I knew Jehovah hadn't forgotten me. I remembered that book.

00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:34.309
I remembered that book when I was a boy. I placed that book out in service.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.400
I opened it up, and of course, that the theme scripture for that publication was Revelation 21,

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:50.679
3 and 4. Ten of God is with mankind. I read it that night. The whole night, I read the whole book.

00:46:51.559 --> 00:46:56.199
Of course, that little bell went off. I couldn't deny that this was the truth.

00:46:56.199 --> 00:47:02.079
So what was I going to do about it? Shortly after that, I got transferred.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.760
So I called my mom and told her, it was funny. She asked, do you think there's any Jehovah's Witnesses

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:13.920
that go up there? I told her, I don't think so. It's way up in the mountains. I don't think they go

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:22.320
there. It's a little fire camp. I wasn't a spiritual person yet. All the magazines and books

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:32.210
went back into the box and back under my bunk. It only been there five minutes and a guard comes in

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:38.849
and said, are you a Jehovah's Witness? I couldn't believe it. And I told my study,

00:47:38.849 --> 00:47:45.969
I've been studying with Jehovah's Witnesses and he said, oh, good, follow me. And I followed him and

00:47:45.969 --> 00:47:52.849
he took me and introduced me to a brother who had been coming up there regularly to study the

00:47:52.849 --> 00:48:02.050
Bible with inmates there. And I realized at that moment that once again, Jehovah had not forgotten

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:09.570
me. A brother faithfully came up there for the next two years every Friday night.

00:48:11.909 --> 00:48:16.630
He thought that if you could idea to have a Theocratic Mystery School, so he got it approved.

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:21.590
He would do the number one talk and the other brother that would come with him to do the highlights

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:27.030
and then the three of us inmates would do the other parts. I was given a talk every week.

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:35.190
He started making tape recordings of the meetings. I listened to him over and over until the next week.

00:48:37.489 --> 00:48:42.610
I knew that if I was going to return to Jehovah, I had to make some adjustments.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:49.889
Which Jehovah's help. I leaned on him more, relied on his strength more. It was then that I really felt

00:48:49.889 --> 00:48:56.099
that I could do this. The beard became a goatee and then it just became a mustache.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:05.300
No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking. I cleaned my language. Then I finally got released.

00:49:06.019 --> 00:49:11.059
I got a job as an electrician and was able to get my own place and

00:49:11.059 --> 00:49:19.989
started going to meetings. I was listening to the watchtower and different ones were commenting,

00:49:19.989 --> 00:49:27.190
oh that's his wife. One of the brothers that came up to visit me. I kept looking to see so I could

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:35.110
finally put a face to the voices that I'd been listening to. I let Jehovah mold me and to

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:39.590
something good. So how could this scripture be here?

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:45.989
Many blessings have since dedicated my life to Jehovah. I've been an elder for 10 years now.

00:49:45.989 --> 00:49:54.710
One of my sons came into the truth. I met my wonderful wife. She's helped me to grow spiritually

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:59.110
and to love Jehovah even more. One thing I kept praying for and he's blessed me with

00:50:00.389 --> 00:50:07.750
is to forgive myself, to have a clean conscience and bring us to speech. And he's done that.

00:50:12.099 --> 00:50:17.460
Jim shares the same joy as so many others who return to Jehovah.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:24.340
The feelings common in such real life experiences are what we'll see depicted in our music video.

00:50:25.059 --> 00:50:32.179
It's called, I can get back up. It is especially touching with those of us who have stumbled

00:50:32.179 --> 00:50:36.099
but need encouragement to move ahead with Jehovah's help.

00:50:56.719 --> 00:54:43.480
What a beautiful reminder that if we stumble, we can get back up.

00:54:44.679 --> 00:54:50.519
Having seen the examples throughout the program, can you confidently answer the question of our theme?

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:56.119
Are you defined by your circumstances? What do you think?

00:54:57.079 --> 00:55:03.239
Remember, not the way man sees is the way God sees. Jehovah sees what the heart is.

00:55:04.519 --> 00:55:11.639
May we work hard to see ourselves as Jehovah does and be determined to never give up.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:16.519
May we never forget that it is the privilege of bearing Jehovah's name,

00:55:16.519 --> 00:55:20.920
having a relationship with him and our love for Jehovah that defines us.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.320
Jehovah is happy if we give the best that we can.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:31.320
So may we do our part by not limiting ourselves due to our circumstances,

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:35.079
but always look for ways to give our best to Jehovah.

00:55:36.519 --> 00:55:41.880
You beautiful older ones. Even those with severe health problems can do much to help in the

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:45.400
great work that's taking place today. Now you may wonder, what can you do?

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.719
You can pray for your brothers and sisters. We need your prayers.

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:53.239
Pray for the governing body. Pray for those who are taking the lead.

00:55:53.239 --> 00:55:58.440
Pray for the elders in your congregations. Pray for those who are going through difficult times.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.519
Do such prayers help the work of the organization?

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:09.320
Absolutely. James chapter five in verse 16 tells us that a righteous person's

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:17.800
supplication has a powerful effect. No matter who we are and whatever our situation in life,

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:25.239
may we find joy in giving what we can or Jehovah and may each one of us rejoice at the

00:56:25.239 --> 00:56:31.480
privilege we have of being part of what Jehovah is accomplishing in these last days.

00:56:33.079 --> 00:56:39.079
Of course, we share that privilege with our worldwide brotherhood, a part of which we enjoy

00:56:39.079 --> 00:56:46.199
seeing each month. To conclude this program, we visit with our brothers and sisters in Togo.

00:56:47.159 --> 00:56:53.079
A located in Western Africa, Togo enjoys a very pleasant climate year-round.

00:56:54.199 --> 00:57:00.840
The southern coast contains extensive lagoons with sandy beaches, while farther north are

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:07.320
rolling forested hills and yellow tingees of Savannah land. Togo may be one of the smaller

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:12.519
countries in Africa, yet it is sending up a great shout of praise to Jehovah.

00:57:13.239 --> 00:57:21.079
In the town of Palame, there are 577 of our brothers and sisters, 56 of whom are pioneers.

00:57:22.039 --> 00:57:25.639
Palame is located on a scenic woodman plateau.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:31.239
Steep hillsides can sometimes make service a challenge, but not a deterrent.

00:57:32.119 --> 00:57:35.639
Our faithful brothers and sisters not only meet this challenge,

00:57:36.199 --> 00:57:41.320
but are very zealous in carrying out their ministry. They diligently search out all persons,

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:48.280
no matter where they are, and many honest-hearted ones are listening to the good news from God's

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:54.039
worm. The first congregation in Palame was formed in 1961.

00:57:55.159 --> 00:58:01.559
Now there are seven in the small town alone. The Kingdom Halls are very well cared for by the

00:58:01.559 --> 00:58:10.599
brothers. This is the newest Kingdom Hall. Palame Nogo. It was just dedicated in December 2016.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:18.840
And here is their assembly hall, constructed in 2008. All 577

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:26.039
send you their love and greetings, and we in turn send them our love and pray for Jehovah's

00:58:26.039 --> 00:58:32.440
strength and blessing to be upon each and every one of them. From the World Headquarters of

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:37.079
Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
