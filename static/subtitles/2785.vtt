00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.259
The more you study, the more you understand Jehovah, the more you understand Jehovah, the more you love them.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.260
Jehovah clearly tells us that my thoughts are not your thoughts.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.260
So if you want to understand Jehovah's thinking better, we need to dig deep in our study

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
and then share those thoughts with others.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Personal study is like fuel that keeps you going.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.259
Personally, I'm not a good student, but I really learned how to study the Bible.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:38.259
The Bible came alive during Gilead.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:42.259
Self-discipline is involved very much.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:52.259
I overcome the tiredness aspect of Bible study by not doing it at a time of day

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:54.259
when I know I'm going to be tired.

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:57.259
I can be tired for other things later on, but not for that.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:03.259
Each session of my Bible study begins with a prayer.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:10.260
Please help me recognize it is counsel for me and then give me the strength to work on it.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I have a color code system, so I know what certain things stand for.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:22.260
I have a particular color for Jehovah's good hand in people's lives

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.260
that have another color for warning examples.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
I have another core.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
Find examples to imitate.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Study and Meticion wakes together.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Study helps us to acquire information.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.260
And Meticion empowers us to put that information into practice.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.260
You have to get behind the information, not just focus on one verse or a one chapter.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.260
See who's involved, the time, the conditions, how many people are there,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
and then you'll get the true meaning of the verse.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.260
John 1-1, who is the word?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
We can go to verse 18.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.259
Begotten meant he had a beginning, a time when he started.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.259
When he began, in heaven with his father.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.259
That's where he was.

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:21.259
Philippians 4, 6 and 7 is a scripture that I've read many times over.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.259
The peace of God that excels all thought.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:25.259
Okay.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.259
How do you get that?

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.259
It's from having a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:36.259
How is it that God's peace guards your heart by means of Christ Jesus our Lord?

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:40.259
And I said, why by Jesus?

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.259
Because Jesus paid the ransom.

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:48.259
That ransom is what makes possible a relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.259
So it almost goes full circle.

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.259
During my personal study, I tried to identify principles.

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.259
To do this, I tried to look behind the commandment.

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:04.259
For instance, at May 28, 1920, Jesus commanded us to go and make disciples.

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:08.259
Beyond this commandment, I find this principle of loving our neighbor.

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:12.259
Using this principle helped me to preach to all sorts of people

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.259
the goddess of their gender, race or nationality.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:22.259
I attended a school for congregation elders which had gilded graduates as instructors.

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:29.930
One of the methods is to analyze a certain Bible account from different perspectives.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.930
We can't see the whole picture from one angle.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.930
I share my research results with Bible students.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.930
And that helps them to know Jehovah better and it helps them to see

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.930
that what they're studying is a practical value.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.930
I had studied up on Jacob.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.930
He wrestled all night with an angel.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.930
And I wanted to share it with some of my friends.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.930
One of the brothers that happened to sit around when this discussion was going on.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.930
He came back to me and he said to me,

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.930
I had concluded my arrangements to quit for time service.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.930
But after listening to that discussion, I've decided I'm no longer stopping.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.930
And that was such a wonderful moment for me.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.930
I thanked Jehovah.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.930
When I learned that I was going to become a mom, I said,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.930
Jehovah, if this little one could love you, then I'll get to keep him forever.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.930
Then I began to teach everything I was learning to him.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.930
So it's a matter of keeping my face strong and there's no shortcut.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.930
Every session of study that is properly done with good meditation

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.930
adds a new pillar to the strength of our faith.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.930
I look forward to those times when I can run upstairs by myself

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.930
and just shut everything off and it's just me and Jehovah.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.930
Life today is very unpredictable.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.930
I've come to see that as long as I keep a tight grip on God's word,

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.930
nothing can separate me from God's love.
