00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.009
When I went through difficult times during my childhood, Jehovah was like my father.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.789
He was my refuge.

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:26.309
The first memory I have of my dad is when I went to visit him in the prison where he was being held.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:35.909
I asked Jehovah so many times for my dad to come back home.

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:40.320
One day, my mom said,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.320
Dad's coming home today.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.320
I went to school and when I came back, he was there.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.859
I thought he was finally back for good and that it would be forever.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.859
But soon after that, I heard my mom and my grandmother crying.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:07.510
And they started to explain that my dad was back in prison.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:19.790
From then on, I felt hatred, resentment, and anger toward my dad and also towards Jehovah.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.790
I started to take drugs to leading in moral and violent lifestyle.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:34.189
One day, a couple of sisters gave me a magazine.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.189
As I was looking through it, I saw the experience about Dustin.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:47.040
I began to think about the times during my childhood when I would take refuge in Jehovah

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.040
and would feel the same way Dustin did.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.040
I would say, Jehovah is there.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.379
He hasn't abandoned me.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:02:01.109
Dustin never doubted Jehovah's love right up until the day he died.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.109
That very night, I prayed to Jehovah.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.110
I asked him to forgive me because, well,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.150
because it wasn't his fault.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.150
That night, I poured out all my feelings through Jehovah.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:29.689
That burden that I felt was finally gone.

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.689
I felt Jehovah's love every step of the way.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.689
He showed it through the brothers who didn't judge me for what I had done.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:52.539
It doesn't matter how many problems we have or how far we've drifted away from Jehovah.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.539
He never abandoned us.
