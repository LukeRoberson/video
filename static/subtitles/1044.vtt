00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.150
In our life experience, there are many people we do not forget, both good and bad.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.310
But those we delight to call to mind or remember are the people most important and most

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.990
love to us.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.269
This is true of Jehovah as well.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:24.789
He knows everyone who has ever lived, righteous and unrighteous, and He will resurrect millions

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.789
of them.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.469
But what he finds the greatest delight in is remembering those with strong faith who

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:36.829
became his friends, including many faithful women.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.950
His word is filled with accounts of women who had strong faith.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.270
This symposium will consider faithful women from the past with various backgrounds.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.229
We will learn why they needed faith, how they showed faith, and how all of us can imitate

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:56.909
their faith.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.149
We begin with the faithful woman Sarah.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.149
Sarah needed faith.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.150
Why?

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.670
Well, because like her husband Abraham, Sarah accepted a nomadic lifestyle when Jehovah

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.189
directed them to do so.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.750
Hebrews 118 says of Abraham that by faith, he obeyed by going out to a place that he

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.590
was to receive as an inheritance, although not knowing where he was going.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.670
What was true for Abraham was true for Sarah as well.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.670
Along with Abraham, she complied with Jehovah's direction and she left the prosperous city

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.510
of Ur.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.590
She no doubt had to leave behind her relatives as well as material advantages.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.590
We read at Genesis 12 in verse 1 that Abraham was told, Go out from your land and away

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.230
from your relatives.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.950
Such moves are never easy.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.950
Actually, moving is known to be one of the most stressful things that people must do at

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.150
times, especially when it involves moving away from friends and relatives.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.830
Yes, Sarah needed faith and she had it.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.430
She cooperated with her husband's direction, which meant accepting a completely different

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.430
way of life.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.469
Her obedience revealed her strong faith in Jehovah.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:34.469
As you watch the following video, imagine the challenges that Sarah faced.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.030
Life in Ur was comfortable.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.990
We had all the modern conveniences.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.550
Then Jehovah gave us an assignment we never expected.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.469
One that meant saying goodbye to the life we loved.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:54.270
But rather than look behind, Abraham and I looked ahead.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.590
We had seen Jehovah's hand in our lives and we knew he would be with us every step of

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.430
the journey.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.629
And he was in ways that surprised us.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.590
Ways we never could have imagined.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.629
Jehovah did more than help us.

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:19.919
He fulfilled his every promise.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.639
As accurately depicted in that video, how did Sarah show faith?

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.560
She showed faith by looking ahead.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.400
She also reflected on what Jehovah had already done for them.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.560
Abraham and Sarah had seen Jehovah's hand in their lives.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.319
They were his friends.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.000
They obeyed before.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.199
And Jehovah had confidence in their obedience now.

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:48.479
As a woman of strong faith, Sarah trusted that Jehovah would continue to be with them

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.479
in their new assignment.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.560
She willingly gave up the comforts and conveniences of her.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.840
And her faith in God did not go unrewarded.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.159
In time, she received a blessing that she never could have anticipated.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.599
Sarah's faith in Jehovah led to the birth of Isaac.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.159
What made this blessing especially remarkable is described for us at Hebrews chapter 11

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.000
verses 11 and 12.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.360
Let's read those verses.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.480
Hebrews chapter 11 lists a number of faithful servants of God.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.040
Sarah is mentioned along with Abraham.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.160
As we read starting in verse 11, notice how the focus is on faith.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.759
By faith, also Sarah received power to conceive offspring,

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.160
even when she was past the age,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.480
since she considered him faithful who made the promise.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.519
For this reason, from one man who was as good as dead,

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:52.399
there were born children as many as the stars of heaven and number

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:57.879
and as innumerable as the sands by the sea side.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:03.439
So what remarkable blessing did Sarah receive as a result of her faith?

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:10.199
The power to conceive offspring, even when she was past the age it said.

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.560
But how specifically did she show faith?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.360
She showed faith because she considered him faithful who had made the promise.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.839
Sarah had faith in Jehovah's promise that Abraham would become the father to many.

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:27.920
Abraham needed faith, but so did Sarah.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.439
And because they both had such faith,

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:35.439
verse 12 says, for this reason there were born children.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.399
Now some might say, but I recall from the scriptures that Sarah laughed

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:41.639
when she heard that she would give birth.

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.279
True, but was that because she lacked faith?

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.480
Not at all.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.680
We read a moment ago that Sarah considered Jehovah faithful.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.839
In other words, she trusted him.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.560
So what happened?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.399
Well, evidently the thought of giving birth at her age struck her as being so unusual

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:03.120
that she could not hold back laughing to herself.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.680
So while she was only all too human, she was undeniably a woman of strong faith.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.759
Years later, Sarah's faith in Jehovah's promise concerning Isaac

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:18.279
moved her to speak up when five-year-old Isaac was persecuted or bullied

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.839
by 19-year-old Ishmael.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.519
She saw a real threat to the well-being of Isaac,

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:28.800
and her faith reminded her that Isaac was more than just her son.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.040
He was assigned a key role in Jehovah's purpose,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.079
so she mustered up courage and spoke up in his defense.

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:40.839
Strong faith helps us to do many things.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.040
In the following dramatization,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:56.939
take note of how a husband and wife show faith like that of Abraham and Sarah.

00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:02.420
Saying goodbye is never easy.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.939
And even though we were excited about our new LDC assignment,

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:22.009
it was going to take us further than we'd ever been.

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.490
It wasn't just a new routine.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:40.199
It was a holy way of life.

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:46.389
With each new movement project, we thought about Sarah.

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:49.990
She focused on the good things ahead,

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.339
and not on what she had left behind.

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:56.300
And that's what we tried to do.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:09:04.799
Jehovah's been so good to us.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:09.799
We didn't always know where the next project would take us,

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:22.470
but we did know that Jehovah would be with us every step of the way.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.950
As demonstrated in that video,

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:31.470
we can strengthen our faith by meditating on Jehovah's goodness to his people in the past,

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.990
and his goodness to his people today.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.950
Take time to meditate on how Jehovah has helped you

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.789
when you've made sacrifices in his service.

00:09:42.789 --> 00:09:45.230
As the sister in the video stated,

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:49.190
Sarah focused on the good things ahead,

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.070
and not on what she had left behind.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.830
We show faith like that of Sarah's

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:01.590
when we support the decisions that are made by God's organization today.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:07.590
Imitate Sarah's faith and follow Jehovah's direction closely.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.830
When we are obedient to Jehovah's direction,

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.070
then as Hebrews 13, 17 states,

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:20.830
the brothers may carry out their responsibilities with joy and not with sign.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:26.309
For married sisters, this means displaying a Sarah-like spirit in their marriage.

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:32.870
A Christian wife respects and supports her husband in doing Jehovah's will.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:38.509
The Apostle Peter wrote that such a spirit has great value in the eyes of God.

00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:44.950
What are some of the many ways in which sisters today display faith like Sarah's?

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:51.669
Well, many Christian women of strong faith are supportive of their husbands in the circuit work.

00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:57.750
Many others leave family behind when accepting an assignment from local design construction

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.190
or the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:07.549
And many sisters serving at Bethel do so far away from their families.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.070
And this is true of single sisters as well.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:15.789
All of these and many more show Sarah-like faith

00:11:15.789 --> 00:11:22.429
by trusting in Jehovah's loving care and making themselves available in his service.

00:11:22.429 --> 00:11:27.830
We are confident that Jehovah sees these acts of faith.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:33.070
Hebrews 13, 16 says that God is well pleased with such sacrifices.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:39.470
So see their example and imitate their faith.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.149
Brother James Mans, a helper to the writing committee,

00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:47.029
will now present the next talk in this symposium.

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:50.470
imitate women of strong faith, Rahab.
