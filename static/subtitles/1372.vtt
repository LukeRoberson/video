00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:10.419
The city is hosting a golf championship, and we are so excited to reach out to all of these international visitors.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:19.390
This was the first time in Charlotte that we had such a major sporting event.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.390
People would be coming from some 60 countries, a total of some 200,000 were expected.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.390
And so when the branch contacted us and said this was a special public witnessing initiative,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.390
we knew that we wanted to do our very best to reach as many of those people as possible.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.390
It was about advertising JW.org, Jehovah and the Kingdom.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.390
And so we were looking at what would give the greatest visibility to the cart and our effort.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.390
The branch office was very, very supportive. They gave us good direction.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.390
They put us in touch with brothers that have been involved in organizing a public witnessing initiative for another large sports event.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.390
And they provided us with so much insight from their experience.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:15.390
This was the first time that some five circuits, 75 caringations, multiple language groups got a chance to work on one project together.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.390
We ended up with 48 locations and some 1400 publishers trained to man these locations.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.769
We were running shifts from six in the morning until eight at night.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:40.079
Organization and scheduling was the key and they did it beautifully.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.079
With public witnessing, individuals often come to us because they see our smiling faces.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.079
We try to maintain a friendly disposition, a happy one.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.079
We always try to make eye contact.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.079
And if it's morning, we greet them with a good morning.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.079
One sister said that she smiled people over to the cart and that's really what a smile can do.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:12.080
They're looking for something to make them happy to enjoy life and you represent that just by smiling.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.080
When they see a topic that catches their attention and internally they're asking themselves these questions.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.080
If they really want to find the answers, they'll come over.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:32.080
You can see as cars pass by that they're taking note of our presence and it's a witness of itself.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.080
We've had individuals stop their cars and wave us over to bring the literature to them.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.080
They might just turn briefly but they'll see the cart, they'll see JWB.org.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.830
We talk to people from all over the world.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.830
A man came by, he was from the southern part of Ukraine.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.830
He wanted to know what is this all about.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.830
So I explained the Bible educational work, I explained how at the website he can read literature online in his language.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.830
It was quite impressed.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.830
And then he brought his friend over who was visiting from Kazakhstan and in Russian explained what the cart was all about and what we were doing there.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:22.150
This work has had a real invigorating effect.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:31.150
One sister said, now I no longer think simply in terms of literature placement, I think in terms of looks and smiles.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.150
It identified brothers and sisters who are now excited about doing public witnessing.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.150
We're getting it to opportunity through public witnessing to reach people that we hadn't reached any other way.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.150
We got to talk to so many people about our website that otherwise would have never known about it.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.150
It's really that life-saving message that they're getting the opportunity to see perhaps for the first time when they see these public witnessing carts.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.819
When it was all said and done, this was an outstanding success.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.819
This public witnessing campaign had such a positive effect upon the community.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.819
Through this special effort we were able to show true hospitality to these visitors from all over the world.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:21.819
After the excitement and seeing the productivity of this work, many were commenting, hey when are we going to do this again?

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:28.819
The final result was a witness beyond anything we could have imagined at the very outset.
