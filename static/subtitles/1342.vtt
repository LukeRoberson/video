The City of Naples was chosen as the host city, but the 30th edition of a sports event known as the University had.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:23.339
The event took place from July 3rd to 14th, 2019, and the participants were university athletes from all over the world.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:29.339
Public witnessing carts were organised in areas of the city, where the majority of visitors and athletes would visit.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:35.340
1,225 brothers and sisters all took part in this initiative.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.340
The enthusiasm of our brothers and sisters, along with Jehovah's Blessing, yielded excellent results.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.340
About 15 Chinese athletes approached us as soon as they recognised the logo of our website, one of them even said,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.340
ah, this is Jehovah, and that allowed for a nice conversation.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:05.709
The brothers spent a total of 6,000 hours witnessing, had 1,640 Bible-based conversations and placed 1,456 publications.

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:12.709
The brothers and Naples continue without letter, teaching and declaring the good news at every opportunity.
