00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:05.200
and introduction to the book of Habakkuk.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.369
Habakkuk served as a prophet in Judah.

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:12.769
From the book's closing notation

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.010
to the director with my stringed instruments,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.660
it has been inferred that Habakkuk may have been a temple musician.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.660
He wrote the book, bearing his name of about 628 BCE,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.500
some 20 years before the destruction of Jerusalem.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.619
He was a contemporary of Jeremiah, who also served in Judah.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:42.539
The book of Habakkuk has three chapters.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:49.000
Chapters 1 and 2 present a dialogue between Habakkuk and Jehovah.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.240
The prophet expresses dismay over the violence, oppression,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.479
and injustice that are prevalent in Judah.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:04.920
Jehovah declares that soon the Caldeans will be used to punish the nation of Judah.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.400
Jehovah assures Habakkuk that this divine judgment on Judah will not be late,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.939
and that the Caldeans will also be punished later for their own acts of cruelty and wickedness.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.620
Did you know?

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.620
In Habakkuk's day, Jehovah's Temple was in Jerusalem,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.700
and the Davidic dynasty had ruled uninterrupted from there for over four centuries.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.180
Therefore, to the Jews back then,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.980
God's allowing the Caldeans to destroy the Holy City was unthinkable.

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:46.299
Chapter 3 is a prayer of Habakkuk that is expressed in songs of mourning.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.599
Habakkuk recalls past manifestations of Jehovah's power.

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:58.700
Although distressed by the conditions around him,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.420
the prophet expresses confidence in Jehovah.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.379
Habakkuk declares,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.539
As for me, I will exalt in Jehovah.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.419
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.909
As you read Habakkuk, note how Jehovah is not indifferent to the suffering of his servants.

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:25.110
How our confidence in Jehovah's salvation helps us endure with joy,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.629
and how Jehovah's judgments by means of his kingdom will not be late.
