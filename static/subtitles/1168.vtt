00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:13.359
We pray for the love of the Father,

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:18.699
For the black and red,

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:26.100
And the white people of the world.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:38.969
Now you will find me,

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:57.200
Like the black and blue people of the earth.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:22.120
In the shadows of our eyes

00:01:22.120 --> 00:02:55.240
Today the nations are in firm opposition

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:05.659
At the end of a day, where will I go?

00:03:05.659 --> 00:07:20.139
If I have time, I'll be the king, I'll be the king
