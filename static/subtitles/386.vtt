00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.169
If they've persecuted me, they will also persecute you, Jesus' words.

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.009
And Paul saw the truth of Jesus' words.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.690
As a follower of Jesus, Paul experienced much persecution and tribulation.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.809
And isn't it true we see the same today?

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:24.129
Satan still challenges the integrity of Jehovah's people.

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:29.809
In fact, the Bible indicates that Satan will increase his attacks on Jehovah's people

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.289
in these last days.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.850
And we see this happening.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.049
As we look at the attacks being made on Jehovah's people around the world,

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:40.609
we think of our brothers in Eritrea, our brothers in Korea, in Russia,

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:46.049
other places, and even a smaller attack that we may not even personally hear about.

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.130
Truly, Jesus' words are being fulfilled today.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.850
Well, the question we want to consider today is what about us personally?

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.170
See, the text says that if they've persecuted me, Jesus said, they will persecute you.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.090
In 2 Timothy 3 and verse 12, it says, all those desiring to live

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.129
by with golly devotion will be persecuted.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:12.730
So that means we're not exempt.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.890
And as our text highlights, things can quickly turn.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.450
Sometimes it's outright persecution from governments, opposition, from family members.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.769
In other cases, it may be efforts to block our work.

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:29.609
To hamper a theocratic project or another initiative.

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.569
How will we do when faced with persecution and opposition?

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.969
Now, it's easy to say trust in Jehovah, and we know we need to do that, but what does that mean?

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.090
How do we know what decisions to make, what's the right decision, what's not the right decision?

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.689
Are there principles that can guide us?

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.010
Well, let's consider three of them.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:59.489
The first one is that the apparent easy solution out of a situation may not be the right solution.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:06.049
Look at Isaiah, chapter 30, and we'll look at a solution that the kings of Israel and Judah

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.009
fell back on from time to time.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.599
Isaiah, chapter 30, and let's read verses 1 and 2.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:22.599
It says, woe to the stubborn sons, declares Jehovah, who carry out plans that are not mine.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.479
Who make alliances, but not by my spirit.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:31.319
In order to add sin to sin, they go down to Egypt without consulting me,

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.280
to take shelter under Pharaoh's protection, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.039
You see, the nation thought it was a good solution to enlist Egypt's aid to keep off the Babylonians and others.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:52.280
That seemed to be the best choice, and we saw over and over again the unfaithful kings of Israel and Judah

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.639
did that. They chose to strike deals with Jehovah's enemies to protect them from other enemies of Jehovah.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:07.639
And so, when under attack, when facing opposition, we too may be encouraged to strike a deal,

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.560
maybe a bit of a compromise to lessen the pressure.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.520
But now, in other times, we notice that Paul and others, they did appeal to government officials,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.439
so they appeal to Caesar and Jehovah, bless that.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.199
So, what's the lesson?

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.120
Well, the lesson is that we need to make sure that we're following a course

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.919
that our plans that Jehovah has, that are backed by his spurs.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:36.280
We need to prayerfully make sure that the arrangement that we're working out is Jehovah's will,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:45.800
and to remember that the logical solution from man's perspective may not always be Jehovah's solution.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.800
Second principle, and that is to not become distracted from our main focus and our main work.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.080
We have a good example of that when considering Nehemiah.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.319
As we know, Nehemiah was blocked by enemies of Jehovah who is trying to stop him from completing his

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.280
theocratic project. Look, for example, in Nehemiah chapter 6 and verse 2.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.039
Nehemiah 6 and verse 2, and it says,

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.560
The Sambalat and Gisham immediately sent this message to me,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.240
come, and let us set a time to meet together in the villages of the valley plain of Ono,

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.959
but they were scheming to harm me.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.639
Now, the distance between Jerusalem and the valley plain of Ono was about 30, 35 miles,

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.120
or about 50 kilometers away.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.279
Sambalat was not looking to get together with Nehemiah to work out how they could help them.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:39.160
He was scheming to divert the work, to slow down the work, to oppose the work,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.399
and Nehemiah knew what they were up to.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.399
He knew what he said in verse 3.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:49.000
He says, I sent messages to them saying, I am engaged in a great work,

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.319
and I am not able to come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come to you?

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:00.600
See, Nehemiah did not allow himself to become distracted from his main assignment,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.439
from the work that he had been given to do.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.720
Now, when that didn't work, his apostles tried to get him to choose a solution

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.399
that would harm his reputation, bring reproach on Jehovah's name.

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:12.759
That look over in verse 10.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.240
See, this says, we'll come into the temple.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.199
Let's shut the doors of the temple because they're coming to kill you.

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:19.959
We'll look at verse 13.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.680
He says, he had been hired to frighten me and cause me to sin,

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:30.600
so they would have grounds to damage my reputation in order to reproach me.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.800
We'll see, likewise, at times we may be offered solutions out of a situation,

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.800
or to relieve pressure from opposition, which will distract us

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.839
from our primary work, our service to Jehovah.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.519
Or it may be an initiative that's a little bit in a gray area.

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:49.639
Yes, everybody does it, but it's a gray area.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.319
And it could damage our reputation or bring reproach on Jehovah's name.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.199
So again, what do we do?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.079
Well, we seek Jehovah's direction.

00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:01.560
Will this solution distract us from our main commission?

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.879
How will it appear to onlookers?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.519
What will it do to Jehovah's name?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.480
Now, these first two principles do not mean that we do not do anything,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.160
and that leads to our third principle.

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.879
And that is, we do what we can from a practical standpoint.

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.560
We give Jehovah something to bless, and then we wait on Jehovah.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.920
And the account of Hezekiah is a beautiful example of that.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.879
We have the drama at our convention this year,

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.879
where the ruthless king of Assyria was determined to take Jerusalem,

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:39.160
Ramshika taunted Hezekiah, tried to get the people to surrender to make a deal with Assyria.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.360
What did Hezekiah do?

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.519
Well, he displayed wisdom and military strategy while waiting on Jehovah.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:50.120
He did what he could to give Jehovah something to bless.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.319
Remember what they did?

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.240
They went and they diverted the water sources outside the city,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.399
so that if there was a siege, the Assyrians would have trouble getting water.

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:02.439
They strengthened the city's fortification, the walls.

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.759
They made missiles and abundance and shields.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.399
They did what they could, but they trusted in Jehovah.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:11.240
Remember Hezekiah said to the people,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.439
as recorded in 2 Chronicles 32, 7 and 8,

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:15.959
he says, be courageous and strong.

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:18.839
There's more with us than there is with them.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:25.240
So they did what they could, but they relied on Jehovah for the real solution.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.680
And interestingly, in this case,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.079
Jehovah did not use anything of what they did.

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:31.560
He provided an angel to deliver them.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.879
So likewise, when facing persecution today,

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:39.959
facing opposition today, we do what's in the power of our hand to do,

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.519
while keeping in mind those first two principles,

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.360
and then we see what Jehovah works out in our behalf.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.079
So what's the lesson for us?

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:52.759
Well, the lesson is that in the face of persecution,

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.000
when we're going through opposition,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.839
the way through the situation may not be clear.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.759
It may not be readily apparent,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.560
but look for principles that can help us to make good decisions.

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:09.879
And really, it all boils down to our most effective means

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:12.199
of dealing with persecution and opposition.

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:16.120
Notice what it says in Psalm 9 and verse 10.

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:19.829
Psalm 9 and verse 10,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.120
it says, those knowing your name will trust in you.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.120
You will never abandon those seeking you, O Jehovah.

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:34.519
Those knowing your name will trust in you.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.240
We know Jehovah.

00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:39.399
We know Jehovah's name.

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:41.799
We know what his name means.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.759
We know that Jehovah can become, he can cause us to become,

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:49.879
he can cause any of his creation to become whatever is needed to fulfill his purpose.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.639
We just need to trust in him.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:54.440
He will never abandon us.

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:57.799
So yes, as followers of Jesus,

00:08:57.799 --> 00:08:59.960
we will be persecuted.

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:03.320
We will face opposition.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:07.559
When those days come, how will we do?

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:12.759
Well, may these and other principles help us to make good decisions,

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:16.679
and may we ultimately trust in and wait on Jehovah,

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:20.279
convinced that he will never abandon us.
