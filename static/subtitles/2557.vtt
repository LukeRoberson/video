00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:16.670
We always see on JW broadcasting experiences of how Jehovah takes care of other people but you never think that it's going to happen to you.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:43.659
I've just never seen, I couldn't see the street or anything. It was so intense the raining.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.659
You could just sense the the terror.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:01:02.619
I mean, that was an raging torrent. It was felt like the mountain was coming down.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:10.620
The city was underwater. There was so much water, it was chest high.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.620
Even in the kingdom hall, the level rose above the waist.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:24.620
The chairs were just floating. It was shocking to see the amount of water that was actually inside the kingdom hall.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:32.620
In the one week, there was seven flooding. And each one was just as bad as the last one.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.620
Again, I still didn't understand how bad, and brothers said maybe you better come up to this area. So when I got there, it was devastation.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.620
If it was a two-story house, one story was full of mud. So now the second story was on street level.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.620
In a rainfall of only five hours, everything was swept away, all the houses of the brothers.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.620
When we got there the next day, it seemed like a bomb had gone off. Everything was blown apart.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:09.560
We visited one family and the brothers said, I can't go to the meeting, I don't have a pair of shoes.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.560
And my wife just has to close on her back.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:22.500
One of the local sisters who lost everything, she worked so hard to have built a beautiful home,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.500
beautiful comfortable home. And it was all destroyed in a moment by a landslide.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.500
And to hear her say that, just like the Bible says, that you should store up treasures in heaven,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.500
wear a moth and rust and not consume.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.500
I wish I could put a picture of me in my Bible so that every time I read it, I think that that.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500
She had regrets.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.500
It just taught me that service to Jehovah is always worthwhile.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.500
We can work so hard in the system of things to have a comfortable life, but there's no guarantee we could lose it so quickly.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.500
But the service that we have to Jehovah, it lasts forever. It will never be destroyed.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.500
It was time to get organized with groups of brothers to go and help to clean up the homes of the ones that were affected.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.500
Same like everywhere you look, there were brothers and sisters.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:28.629
They arrived in trucks and buses with buckets, brooms and mobs to help clean out the homes of those affected.

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:37.629
We were cleaning out one house, our first house, and the sisters were putting down bags to put dirt on the bags.

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.629
And then carry it, right?

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.629
Somebody went, man, it would be nice to have a wheelbarrow.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.629
And so we're digging it out and there's a wheelbarrow in the mud.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.629
And we went, hey, there, there's a wheelbarrow. So we got the wheelbarrow.

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:53.629
And that really helped.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.629
We were going to one house of a family of witnesses.

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.629
It was very difficult to get into the house because we couldn't get the front door open because of all the mud.

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.629
Once we actually got into the house, it was like, where do we start?

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:07.629
It was overwhelming.

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:14.879
There was one brother that was just stood there watching inside the middle of the house, wouldn't they?

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.879
Yeah, we kind of thought, why isn't he helping?

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.879
And then we realized after a while that this was his house.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.879
He explained that after each of the floods during the week, he cleaned his house out.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:30.879
And then another flood came, he cleaned his house out. He did another one.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:38.879
Until he got to the sixth one and after that, he'd lost all his energy, all his spirit.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.879
So he just left it. He couldn't do any more.

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.879
I think we realized at that point, it wasn't just important to go and dig someone's house out.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:51.879
It was important to take care of them as well.

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:56.879
We realized that during this disaster, a lot of the friends needed spiritual encouragement.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.879
And that's what we really wanted to bring.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:05.879
We give them a hug to show them that we love them and appreciate them even though they went through a very hard time.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:12.879
Just as the Bible says, when one member suffers, the rest of the body also suffers and feels the pain.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.879
And we could sense this among the brothers there.

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:21.879
Even brothers from the branch committee came to the area, visiting each publisher personally.

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:27.879
In order to encourage those who had been affected by the disaster, a special meeting was arranged where they gave talks.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.879
All this helped us to see that Jehovah was there.

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.879
He was sending his servants to upbuild us.

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.879
The spirit of the government body and also through the branch committee was to show love to the brothers.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:46.879
They wanted us to make sure that they were spiritually strengthened during these critical times.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.379
We're worried about you. How are you?

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.379
Just hearing them say that was like a pat on the back.

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.379
A hug from Jehovah saying, you're not alone.

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.980
You have your brothers.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.980
You know, it's one thing to read about things like that.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.980
But to see it in action, that's another thing.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.980
You definitely saw love. That is our identified mark, isn't it?

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:22.980
Friends were there early in the morning, late at night, walking through mud, mud on their face, mud in their hair.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.980
They just really showed love in many different ways.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.980
We just want to say thank you to all the friends.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.980
Jehovah understands what we need, when we need it, and it gives us more than what we expected.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.980
To see that no matter what happens, Jehovah is always going to take care of us. That's awesome.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.980
The relief committee, they received a letter from a family.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:54.980
They said the floods could destroy our home, but they cannot destroy our love for Jehovah.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:02.420
And the love that we have for him, and he has for us.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.420
We don't know what situations our brothers will have to face as his system winds down to finish.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:15.420
But one thing we know for certain is that we can count on the support of Jehovah and his organization.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:27.620
If we're not part of this organization, what do we have? We've got nothing.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.620
That's what nothing is.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.620
When I talk about people losing homes and stuff, that's just material things.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:39.620
But staying with the organization, this is the truth.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.620
What an honor. What a privilege to be part of this.
