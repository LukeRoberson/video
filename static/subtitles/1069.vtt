00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.299
Are you struggling to provide for yourself or your family?

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.140
Many today lack the basic necessity, such as food, clean water, adequate housing.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.699
And this causes some to question whether God really cares about humans.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.059
But as Jehovah's people, we are different.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:26.140
We know that Jehovah cares for all of his creation.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.340
But we all know that it is a test of our faith when things get difficult.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.500
So the question is how can we build our faith so that we are strong and it can help us

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.259
get through difficult times?

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:46.700
One way is by examining how Jehovah provides for his animal creation.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700
Now why is that helpful?

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.299
Well that examination gives us confidence that he will care for us as well.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:01:00.859
As an example in the following video, note how Jehovah provides food for a massive sea

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.939
creature.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:17.359
The largest animal alive on earth today is also the largest that has ever lived.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:26.299
The blue whale.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:35.900
Blue whales can grow to be over 30 meters long and weigh up to 180 tons.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.219
Its heart alone may weigh several hundred kilograms.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:48.040
How does such a large creature find enough to eat?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:58.299
The blue whale migrates great distances to find tiny crustaceans known as krill.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.420
When a blue whale finds a school of krill, it accelerates towards the krill.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.340
Opens its giant mouth.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.960
They main gulf hundreds of kilograms of krill with each lunge, amounting to several

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.550
tons per day.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:47.370
Blue whales eat a lot, yet Jehovah provides for them and he will provide for us.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.129
There is the sea, so great and wide, teeming with countless living things, both small and

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.129
great.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.620
Now we are amazed at the way Jehovah provides for all of his animal creation, including

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.460
the sea creatures.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.699
The Bible describes this well if you look at Psalm 104, verses 27 and 28.

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.300
Psalm 104, 27 and 28.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.460
All of them wait for you to give them their food in its season.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.219
What you give them, they gather.

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.539
When you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:37.740
Yes, meditating on this aspect of creation builds our faith.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.900
For example, from the video, do you remember the size of this creature?

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.500
Now can you imagine if you have the assignment to feed just one blue whale?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.819
You just make sure that one whale has enough to eat every day.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.620
Can you imagine that?

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.620
Where would we start?

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:59.460
We have to hire teams of people, figure out how to get the food and how to move the

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.060
food to where the blue whale is swimming.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.539
After we figure out where he is swimming, why it would be a full-time job?

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:11.419
And that would be to feed just one whale and this thousands of them.

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:17.660
And yet Jehovah has it all arranged day after day, we don't even think about it.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.379
You notice in verse 27 it says that all of them wait for Jehovah to give them their

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:23.379
food.

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:26.899
Now it doesn't mean that the whale just kind of floats on the top of the water and

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.100
waits for food to jump in his mouth.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.139
Now it swims, it looks for the food when it finds it, it goes after it, but Jehovah provides

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.660
it.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.779
In verse 28 it says, what he gives them, they gather.

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:47.779
Now you cannot imagine that blue whale thinking, come on really, I'm 180 tons and you're

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.860
going to feed me with a little crustacean, couldn't we have just worked out that I eat

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.579
a couple big tuna every day?

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:58.500
No, they gather what Jehovah gives them.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.420
And verse 28 goes on to say they are satisfied with Jehovah's provisions.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.740
So what's the point?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.339
Well, did you notice the comment in the video?

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:15.060
It said, Jehovah provides for them and he will provide for us.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.540
See, meditating on creation can build our faith, strengthen our faith in Jehovah's

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.500
support.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.540
Note the four lessons that we learn from how Jehovah cares for his creation.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.139
The first is is that if Jehovah has the desire to care for animals and provide for their

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:43.699
needs, do you think that Jehovah has the desire to care for you and your family?

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:49.319
Remember what Jesus expressed in Matthew chapter 6, verse 26, where there, he explained

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.439
how Jehovah cares for his creation, even the small birds.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:57.120
And he said, are you not worth more than they are?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.279
Yes, if Jehovah feels compelled to care for his animal creation, we can be assured that

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.279
he feels compelled to care for you and your family.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:13.800
A second lesson is that we do not need to be unduly anxious about tomorrow.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.519
Rather, we can confidently ask Jehovah for our daily needs.

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:28.480
Look in Matthew chapter 6, verse 31 and 32, Matthew 6, 31 and 32, his says, so never

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:37.160
be anxious and say, what are we to eat or what are we to drink or what are we to wear?

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.439
For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing.

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.360
Your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.360
Yes, Jehovah knows we need them.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.959
He knows exactly what we need and he promises to provide it.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:07:00.279
And if Jehovah has the capacity to feed a 180 ton blue whale, do you think he has the

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:04.319
capacity to feed you and me and our families?

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.319
Absolutely.

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:10.199
See, we do the best that we can and then we trust in Jehovah to do the rest.

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:14.839
And like it mentioned there in Psalms with the animal creation, we wait on Jehovah

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:20.040
and we are satisfied with what he provides.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.600
Our third point is that Jehovah will not abandon us when we face trials.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.759
Look at Hebrews chapter 13 and the latter part of verse 5.

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:38.839
Hebrews 13.5, he says, I will never leave you and I will never abandon you.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.480
Jehovah will never abandon us.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.680
He will care for us even through our hard times.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:46.079
Now how can that help us?

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:50.800
Well, that can help us to make good decisions, good decisions regarding our employment, care

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.079
for our family, worship of Jehovah.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:59.360
We will remember Jesus words in Matthew chapter 6 verse 33 where he says, seek first the

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:06.079
kingdom and all these other things will be given to you.

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:12.120
And finally, our fourth point, Jehovah promises that he will abundantly care for all of our

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:14.879
needs in the future.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:20.399
We think of that beautiful promise in Isaiah chapter 65 and verse 22 where it says, for

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:25.879
the days of my people will be like the days of a tree.

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:32.320
Now the blue whale is thought to live 80 to 90 years and Jehovah keeps providing for it.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.320
He does not have a limited supply of provision.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.399
Well, that gives us confidence that it's not beyond Jehovah's ability to fulfill his promise

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:45.480
and care for us through all eternity.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:53.120
So yes, Jehovah's word and his creation give us irrefutable proof of his constant loving

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.519
care, proof that he cares for us today, that he will care for us through our difficult

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:03.960
days and proof that he will care for us through all eternity.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:11.360
So may all of us continue to build our faith, fortify our trust in Jehovah, become powerful

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.559
by faith.

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:20.960
We need that faith now and we most definitely will need it to face what is to come.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.679
Now brother Ron Kerzen, a helper to the teaching committee, will present the final talk of

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:31.399
this symposium, use creation to build your faith, our bodies.
