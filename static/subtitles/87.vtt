WEBVTT

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.330
We're delighted you could join us.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.330
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for December 2021.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:34.380
The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead has now completed 150 classes.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.380
This certainly is a Theocratic milestone made possible with Jehovah's help.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.380
This 150th class was a little different.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.380
There were only 24 students, which is much less than usual.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.380
And because of travel restrictions based on the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.380
all are citizens of the United States.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.379
Though this group was different than in years past, the goal remained the same.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.379
To strengthen their faith so that they can strengthen others wherever they are assigned.

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:20.379
The graduation program helped the students to focus on key points they will benefit from on into the future.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:27.379
Please enjoy part one of the graduation that was held on Saturday, September 11, 2021,

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:33.620
at the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson, New York.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:43.620
I'm going to go back in many decades ago, Monday, March 6, 1972.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.620
Some of you in the class weren't alive.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.620
I think I know of one for sure, was alive.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.620
That's inside joke, not inside story.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.620
Along with my wife, we had the privilege, and that was rare, unless you were a Bethelite,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.620
to attend the graduation of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.620
It was the 52nd class.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.620
So we're in the assembly hall, jam-packed there in New York City,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.620
and just enjoying what a privilege for us to sit here and enjoy this program.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.620
This 52nd class.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.620
Now here we are almost 100, just two classes later, 150th class.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.620
And now we're grateful because many are tied in live as we speak,

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.620
but then the rest of the brotherhood is going to have it available in a few months.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.620
So boy, things have changed and they enjoy that privilege, but that was a rare privilege.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.620
And I remember where the nor was the chairman of the program,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.620
and certainly he just loved Gilead.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.620
I mean, you've got to give him, of course, Jehovah used him mightily to get it all started there.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.620
43, the first one, but knowing that the beast was coming out,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.620
Jehovah bless him said, yeah, we need a missionary school.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.620
It was a missionary school for years.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.620
But anyway, the thing I wanted to mention is, I remember an outstanding talk.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.620
I'd heard Brother Fred Franz, the summer before at the Yankee Stadium convention,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.620
but we were a little closer there in the assembly hall.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.620
And I'll tell you what, I was just glued to him.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.620
If you had the privilege to hear him, Jehovah bless, he had a blessed, beautiful mind.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.620
He could just quote these scriptures, and I've told folks now,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.620
if you don't pay attention to stay with him, you're going to get lost.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.620
He's going to lose you, but if you pay attention, it was thrilling.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.620
Just to hear him.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.620
Pour out his heart because it was all written on his figure of heart.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.620
But he discussed it. Please ask these five.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.620
That's why I was thinking to bring it up for your class here,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.620
because this is really directed to you.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.620
And he spoke there about vows.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.620
And those first seven verses, dreams are mentioned.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.620
And I appreciate it because it just struck me when he mentioned it.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.620
The dreams don't refer to dreams one has while they're sleeping because of a busy day.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.620
Now, you can't get that on your own.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.620
Just reading Ecclesiastes with whatever version you had.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.620
It had to do with getting sidetracked with personal pursuits, these dreams.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.620
These are the things they're doing.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.620
And that would be vanity, as we've said then.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.620
So let's just take a moment here in the class.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.620
And others are going to follow along and please ask these five.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.620
Just touch on some of the nice things.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.620
And of course, you can.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.620
Now, you don't do it right now, but you can do it later.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:21.620
You have access to the research guide and in depth understanding of this wisdom and ecclesiastes.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.620
And Brother Francis addressed it.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.620
And for example, verse one, watch your step.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.620
So this is for here.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.620
You are soon to be graduates.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.620
Do you hope it's saying watch your step?

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.620
Don't stop doing that.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.620
You have thus far so continue to watch your step.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.620
And he mentions those morally stupid ones.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.620
That's not you.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.620
You're going to avoid that.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.620
And then I love this in verse two.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.870
Do not be quick with your mouth.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.870
Boy, there's a lot of people in the world who can benefit from that counsel.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.870
That's true.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.870
It's like, does he or she ever shut up?

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.870
I mean, I bet you they talk in their sleep.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.870
They just won't shut up.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.870
Then anyway, don't be quick with your mouth, particularly in context here.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.870
When you're speaking to Jehovah.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.870
Boy, that's some good things because this you brothers will speak in public.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.870
But you sisters too, when it's personal with your prayers to Jehovah.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.870
Don't be quick with your mouth when you approach the sovereign of the universe.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.870
Your words should be few.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.870
You do not impress God with vocabulary.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.870
He's impressed with sincerity of heart.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.870
Loves those that love him.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.870
And all different languages, he treasures those prayers.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.870
And then he mentions this about a dream comes from too many preoccupations

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.870
and the revised Bible here.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.870
Too many cares.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.870
So this idea isn't just dreams from a busy busy day.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.870
This preoccupation with self is being warned against here.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.870
Don't do it.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.870
They do not do it.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.870
Don't be preoccupied with yourself.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.870
And those that are there, many words from them.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.870
But be careful.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.870
You have the privilege now.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.870
You'll be praying more in public.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.870
Probably than you have ever before.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.870
You get privileges.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:43.870
And when you're praying to Jehovah, sometimes we don't want to be counseling,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.870
criticizing prayers.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.870
We try to be careful of that.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.870
But sometimes you even hear a prayer at best and it's like,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:57.470
OK, we're trying to eat breakfast here.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.470
And I told folks, it's like, you know, I just can't help it.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:06.470
But Jesus is there, most eloquent person to walk the planet.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.470
And the meal comes.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.470
He raises his eyes to heaven and gave things.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.470
Amen.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.470
Let's eat.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.470
I mean, there are other times you want to pour out your heart and all that.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.470
But you're not praying to the audience.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.470
You're talking to the sovereign of the universe.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.470
The council is, you know, you know, now I'm a Gillian graduate.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.470
Your brother's particularly, I might have longer prayers.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.470
I hope not.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.470
I sure hope not.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.470
Unless they're private.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.470
But then he gets into something crucial.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:51.470
And it's just so important to keep mine verse four.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.470
Let's read four and five.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.470
Whenever you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.470
For he finds no pleasure in the stupid ones, morally stupid.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:11.470
Then very clear, what you vow, pay, what you vow, pay.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:17.470
And then it's better for you not to vow than to vow in that pay.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.470
So this is serious counsel.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:25.470
And the warning, don't allow your mouth to cause you to sin.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:30.470
Now, so when it comes to vows and some of you are married,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.470
well, you had the vow.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.470
You always have to hold on to that.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.470
That's not a light matter what you've got.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.470
And in the other vow, so be careful.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.470
If you're going to make a vow, it's between you and him.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.470
But see, notice here.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.470
Do not allow in verse six, your mouth to cause you to sin.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.470
And do not say before the angel.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.470
You see, think about this.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.470
That it was a mistake.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.470
So Jehovah has the angels doing all sorts of things.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.470
We don't even begin to know the things that are always going on all the time.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.470
Jehovah's service.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.470
It's holy angels.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.470
It's priceless.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.470
But see angels are according to this sign.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.470
So check out these things.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.470
So you don't say to the angel, well, look, I made a mistake.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.470
Forgive me.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.470
You made a vow.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.470
But see, it shouldn't be because an angel is going to check if that's Jehovah's direction.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:40.470
It should be because of our love for Jehovah.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.470
When you make a vow, you know, there was marriage or whatever,

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:50.470
your love for Jehovah, that's what cements the vow.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.470
It matters.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.470
See, it matters to him.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:04.470
So then finally, verse seven, for just as many preoccupations lead to dreams,

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.470
so too many words lead to futility.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.470
So good counsel.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:16.470
You are so filled with the word of God.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:22.470
This is a special class and gillied as a special school.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.470
We have other schools, SKE.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.470
I'll mention something later about that.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.470
But this is unique to have men.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.470
Jehovah's appointed to instruct teaching committee.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:43.470
Select some totally whole soul and devoted to Jehovah God teaching you during the class.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.470
And you're going over all these things and the word of God.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:52.470
So it's all in there and it's just special.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:12:01.470
So you think Jehovah that you have this education and you're going to move forward to glorify him.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:10.470
See, and that's pretty well similar to what it's mentioned here in the last sentence in verse seven.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.470
But fear the true God.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:20.470
So you soon to be graduates, keep those words in your heart.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:30.470
Just fear the true God in the days ahead and stay away from these kind of dreams about self.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:36.470
Preoccupation, you know, no, not for you.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:42.470
And otherwise your education was futile.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.470
Not good.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.470
And I don't see that in any of you and not in applying.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.470
But such wise counsel from Jehovah God in his word.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.470
So there's much, much more there.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:03.470
I'm thinking about it with a little tool we have there with the research guide.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:13.470
Now, we appreciate the next speaker very much and put his heart in his talk of brother Mark Sanderson.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:20.470
And we have a nice line up that brothers prepared their talks with all their heart.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:26.470
Mark's a member of the governing body and his talk is a question as a theme.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.470
What will they be like?

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:39.539
Brother Sanderson, please.

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:44.539
At Luke chapter six and verse 40, Jesus said,

00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:48.539
a student is not above his teacher.

00:13:48.539 --> 00:13:55.539
But everyone who is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.

00:13:55.539 --> 00:13:59.539
Well, now what comes to your mind when you think about this verse?

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:04.539
Maybe you tend to think of it in terms of when you conduct a Bible study with someone.

00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:11.539
Or you might think about it when you go to a program like Gilead and you're instructed there.

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:22.539
But in reality, we are all teachers every day in the classroom of Christian living.

00:14:23.539 --> 00:14:33.539
If we have responsibilities, if we enjoy certain privileges, our brothers and sisters will watch us.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:43.860
And those who work closely with us will learn from us and they will become like us.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.860
Take the example of the Apostle Paul.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.860
Now we know Paul was an outstanding teacher.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:58.860
Can you imagine under inspiration he had the privilege to write 14 books of the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:04.860
Yet that was not the only way that the Apostle Paul taught others.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:10.860
His example in Christian living was very powerful.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.860
Now what could people learn from the example of Paul?

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.860
Let's consider some examples.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.860
Let's go first to 1 Thessalonians, chapter 2.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.389
1 Thessalonians, chapter 2.

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:28.389
And let's look at verse 7.

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:36.389
On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:45.389
So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of God,

00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:54.389
but also our very selves because you became so beloved to us.

00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:57.389
Paul worked hard for the brothers.

00:15:57.389 --> 00:16:00.389
He was kind. He was gentle with them.

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:06.389
He was willing to give not just the message of the truth, but as he says in verse 8,

00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:14.389
our very selves and brothers, that was the truth.

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:20.389
Paul said he was willing to do all things for the sake of the good news.

00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:23.389
And just consider some of the things that he did.

00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:30.389
Let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and just remind ourselves that some of the things Paul went through.

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:36.389
2 Corinthians 11 verse 23, Paul says,

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:38.389
Are they ministers of Christ?

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:40.389
I reply like a man, man.

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:42.389
I am more outstandingly one.

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:50.389
I have done more work, been imprisoned more often, suffered countless beatings and experienced many near deaths.

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:54.389
5 times I receive 40 strokes, less one from the Jews.

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:59.389
3 times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned.

00:16:59.389 --> 00:17:02.389
3 times I experienced shipwreck.

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:10.390
A night and a day I have spent in the open sea, and the list just goes on.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:17.390
What was, what could these ones who worked with Paul learn from him?

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:31.390
In other words, how did Paul's powerful example of love for God, of endurance, of hard work, and true unselfishness affect those around him?

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.390
Well, consider Timothy, who worked so closely with Paul.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.390
What did Paul say about him?

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:46.859
Let's go to Philippians chapter 2, Philippians chapter 2 and verse 20.

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:55.859
Paul said, For I have no one else of a disposition like his, who will genuinely care for your concerns.

00:17:55.859 --> 00:18:00.859
For all the others are seeking their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:10.859
But you know the proof he gave of himself, that like a child with a father, he slaved with me to advance the good news.

00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:16.859
Well, now here's a question, why was Timothy that way?

00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:23.859
Why was Timothy so unselfish? Why did he work so hard for other people?

00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:29.859
Well, no doubt, he was perfectly instructed, not just by the words,

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:33.859
but by the example of Paul.

00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:36.859
Well, the same thing could be true of Priscilla and Aquila.

00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:42.859
Paul said about them that they had risked their necks for him.

00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:45.859
Well, where did they learn that from?

00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:52.859
You see, we could go on with other examples of other close associates of Paul, but what is the point?

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:58.859
Paul's example in Christian living instructed those around him.

00:18:58.859 --> 00:19:01.859
They became like Paul.

00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:09.859
Now, why is that important to you, who are graduating today from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:21.859
Well, very soon you're going to be graduates, and your mandate is to go forth and strengthen and stabilize the field and branch territory.

00:19:21.859 --> 00:19:24.859
But now that's a big long term, isn't it?

00:19:24.859 --> 00:19:28.859
What is the field and branch territory?

00:19:28.859 --> 00:19:31.859
It's people. It's people.

00:19:31.859 --> 00:19:39.859
Spiritual men and women who want to be learned, who want to learn, who want to be trained,

00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:48.859
who want to reach the spiritual goals that they've set for themselves, and who want to grow to Christian maturity,

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:54.859
and because you are a Gilead graduate, they will watch you.

00:19:54.859 --> 00:20:01.859
They will listen to you, and they will be instructed by your example.

00:20:01.859 --> 00:20:07.859
When I went to serve many years ago, where the need was great on the island of Newfoundland,

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:16.859
we were so blessed to have in our congregation a graduate of the seventh class of Gilead, Brother Fred Weins.

00:20:16.859 --> 00:20:22.859
Brother Weins was an anointed brother who was baptized in 1928.

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:29.859
Now, I'll be honest with you, I don't remember even one talk that Fred Weins gave.

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:37.859
But his warmth, his sense of humor, his zeal for the ministry, and his love for people,

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:42.859
the example that he set is truly unforgettable.

00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:47.859
Fred talked to everyone, and I mean everyone in the ministry.

00:20:47.859 --> 00:20:54.859
One time, we were out in the service, we pulled into the gas station, as soon as we stopped the car, Fred jumped out,

00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:59.859
and when we were ready to leave, we looked around to try to find Fred.

00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:04.859
Wasn't in the store, wasn't in the bathroom, he was nowhere to be seen.

00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:07.859
Finally, we thought we'd check the other cars.

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:10.859
Well, that's exactly where Fred was.

00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:18.859
Fred had knocked on the window and gotten in the car, and started to preach to all the people in that car.

00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:28.859
Fred has now gone on to his reward, but his example of warmth, kindness, zeal, and love for people,

00:21:28.859 --> 00:21:35.859
continued to teach me, and many others who knew him well, right down to this day.

00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:39.859
So here is the question that rests before you.

00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:44.859
What will you teach others by your example?

00:21:44.859 --> 00:21:46.859
Be like Paul.

00:21:46.859 --> 00:21:50.859
Love your brothers and sisters right from your heart.

00:21:50.859 --> 00:21:58.859
Through your example, create an atmosphere of warmth and love like a greenhouse

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:02.859
where young plants can blossom and grow.

00:22:02.859 --> 00:22:09.859
Your fine example can warm up a congregation, a circuit, a Bethel department,

00:22:09.859 --> 00:22:12.859
perhaps even a branch office.

00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:23.859
Never allow yourself to be a cold executive who creates an atmosphere like a freezer.

00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:32.859
Because those little plants will shrivel up and they will stop growing in that environment.

00:22:32.859 --> 00:22:39.859
Yes, be willing to impart not just the many wonderful truths of God's Word that you learned at Gilead,

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:43.859
but your own heart and your own soul.

00:22:43.859 --> 00:22:51.859
And then because those beautiful spiritual people you work with will be properly instructed.

00:22:51.859 --> 00:22:54.859
What will they be like?

00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:58.859
They will be just like you.

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:10.940
And may the blessing of our marvelous God, Jehovah, go with you wherever you go.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:19.940
Thank you very much, Brother Sanderson, for that interesting scriptural discussion and some of those past experiences.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.940
Of course, the brother might be saying, should have paid closer attention to my talks.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.940
No, no.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.940
It was out against how much you loved him.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:38.940
Okay. Now, Clive Martin, the helper to the writing committee is going to address us now.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:46.569
With this interesting theme, remember the terms of peace.

00:23:46.569 --> 00:23:50.569
Have you ever had to sue for peace?

00:23:50.569 --> 00:23:56.569
Why are you thinking of the question? Would you please turn with me to Luke chapter 14?

00:23:56.569 --> 00:24:01.569
I'd like to put you and me in the middle of one of Jesus' illustrations.

00:24:01.569 --> 00:24:07.569
Jesus has been talking about what it costs to become one of his disciples.

00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:11.569
And then, in verse 31, he says,

00:24:11.569 --> 00:24:15.569
or what king? This is where we come in.

00:24:15.569 --> 00:24:28.569
What king marching out against another king in war does not first sit down and take counsel whether he's able with 10,000 troops to stand up to the one who comes against him with 20,000?

00:24:28.569 --> 00:24:41.039
If, in fact, he cannot do so, then while that one is yet far away, he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace.

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:45.039
How do you think their conversation goes?

00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:51.039
I want peace, and these are my terms. Hardly.

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:55.039
It's more like, I don't want to be your enemy.

00:24:55.039 --> 00:25:01.039
Please, tell me what to do so that I can have peace with you.

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:06.039
Now, with that in mind, Jesus gives the application. First, 33.

00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:17.509
In the same way, you may be sure that not one of you who does not say goodbye to all his belongings can be my disciple.

00:25:17.509 --> 00:25:24.509
That is you and me. We got to the point where we realized we did not want to be an enemy of Jehovah.

00:25:24.509 --> 00:25:37.509
And so we were willing to sacrifice everything, belongings, career, status, everything for the privilege of being a peace with Jehovah and a disciple of his son.

00:25:37.509 --> 00:25:46.509
Now, for you students of Class 150, your pursuit of peace with Jehovah has led you into the special full-time service.

00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:51.509
And what a beautiful record every one of you has set.

00:25:51.509 --> 00:26:00.509
You remind me, in many ways, of a group in the Bible that literally sued for peace.

00:26:00.509 --> 00:26:04.509
Now, their story is told in the book of Joshua, chapter 9.

00:26:04.509 --> 00:26:08.509
That's right. We're talking about the Gibbianites.

00:26:08.509 --> 00:26:11.509
Do you have Joshua, chapter 9?

00:26:11.509 --> 00:26:19.509
They had heard of all the things that Jehovah had done for his people Israel and to his enemies.

00:26:19.509 --> 00:26:26.509
They did not want to be Jehovah's enemy. And so they did exactly what the King and Jesus illustration did.

00:26:26.509 --> 00:26:32.509
They sent a body of ambassadors. So Joshua, chapter 9.

00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:39.509
And this is the opening overture in verse 6.

00:26:39.509 --> 00:26:45.509
We have come from a distant land. Now, make a covenant with us.

00:26:45.509 --> 00:26:51.509
When they didn't get a very warm initial reception, they persisted, verse 8.

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:58.509
We are your servants. In other words, set the terms. We want peace.

00:26:58.509 --> 00:27:07.509
They were willing to sacrifice everything in order to enjoy peace with Israel and with Israel's God.

00:27:07.509 --> 00:27:17.509
Now, Joshua and the chieftains didn't see it exactly the same way, particularly when they found out that they were not from a distant land as they had claimed.

00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:22.509
Nobody likes to be fooled. So the tone got a little stoner.

00:27:22.509 --> 00:27:26.509
So turn, look at verse 23. This is what they said.

00:27:26.509 --> 00:27:37.509
From now on, you are cursed and you will always occupy a slave's position as gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.

00:27:37.509 --> 00:27:42.509
What will it give me, and I say to that? 25.

00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:50.509
We are at your mercy due to us whatever you think is good and bright.

00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:55.509
And just so, the terms of peace were set, verse 27.

00:27:55.509 --> 00:28:09.509
That day, Joshua made them gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for Jehovah's altar at the place that he should choose, and they remain so to this day.

00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:17.509
So now, a few questions, a few lessons. What do you think of the Gibyanite assignment?

00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:20.509
It was presented to them as a punishment.

00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:25.509
But just think. There had been sold off as household slaves.

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:34.509
Their humble service would directly contribute to pure worship and support Jehovah's people.

00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:41.509
That's a privilege, isn't it? I mean, that's the kind of service we reach out for as a privilege.

00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:54.369
Now, the kind of service, was it because they were lowly people, no skills to do anything else that they were given this kind of job?

00:28:54.369 --> 00:29:03.369
Well, look at chapter 10 and verse 2, kind of people the Gibyanites were.

00:29:03.369 --> 00:29:07.369
Gibyan was a great city, like one of the royal cities.

00:29:07.369 --> 00:29:15.970
It was greater than AI and all its men were warriors, capable, skilled people.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:29.970
However, clearly the Gibyanites realized that if their army was no match for Israel, then Jehovah didn't need them to bolster his army in order to complete the conquest.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:36.970
It was better for them to ask Jehovah what he wanted them to do and to do that.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:41.970
So the sacrifice was definitely worth it.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:48.970
Does that mean, though, that their skills were irrelevant, never even considered?

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:59.970
Oh, no. For example, a few hundred years later, Ishmaja the Gibyanite is listed among David's 30 mighty men.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:03.970
Different needs, calls for different skills.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.970
What did Ishmaja do with his skill?

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:11.970
Well, he humbly defended pure worship and Jehovah's people.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:17.970
So the details of the assignment were different, but the focus was about the same.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:26.339
Another question, was this just a short-term starter assignment?

00:30:26.339 --> 00:30:36.710
Yeah, we'll do this for now, but once the campaign is over, we'll be able to resume our regular place in society.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.710
Well, back to verse 27 of chapter 9.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.710
Remember what Joshua said at this point when he gave them their assignment?

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:47.710
They remain so to this day.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:56.710
Not only to the day that Joshua wrote these words, about 900 years later,

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:04.710
among the exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem to restore pure worship were temple servants.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:10.710
And likely, this included descendants of the Gibyanites.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:23.710
Just think, these temple servants, once again, were willing to leave behind the life that they'd built up to make the track in behalf of pure worship and take up their duties.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:29.710
They must have really cherished their assignment in order to stick to it that way.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.180
So as we've talked about them, have you been noting some personal lessons?

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.180
These are the four that come to my mind.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:46.180
Number one, as with the King in Jesus' illustration and the Gibyanites,

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.180
peace with Jehovah is such a treasure.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.180
We're willing to sacrifice anything to enjoy it.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:06.180
Number two, Jehovah's terms for us include humble service on behalf of pure worship and in support of his people.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:11.180
And that kind of humble service we view as the greatest privilege.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:16.180
Number three, different needs call for different skills.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:23.180
And that may lead to a change of assignment for you or for someone else.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.180
Either way, we don't compete, we don't compare.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:33.180
The details of the assignment may be different, but the focus or goal is always the same.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:38.180
And the fourth one, we cherish our assignment.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:43.180
We're going to stay in it as long as Jehovah allows.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:49.180
In short, we cherish our assignment. We love our God.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.180
Peace with Jehovah is a treasure that we will never let go.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:33:01.769
Thank you very much.

00:33:01.769 --> 00:33:04.769
Appreciate it that very much.

00:33:04.769 --> 00:33:06.769
We're now at peace.

00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:10.769
Brother Martin, thank you for those kind, encouraging thoughts.

00:33:10.769 --> 00:33:19.769
Now, this is something special for you here in the class, the 150th class of Gilead.

00:33:19.769 --> 00:33:23.769
Now, you may be wondering about your post-graduation life.

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:25.769
Probably been doing that.

00:33:25.769 --> 00:33:27.769
At least a couple of weeks.

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:37.769
And how will you use what you've learned from Gilead to strengthen and stabilize the branch organization and others?

00:33:37.769 --> 00:33:41.769
I remember the Sanderson touched on that.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:45.769
And you'll hear more later about that, that's our purpose.

00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:48.769
Now, here's a question to ponder.

00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:51.769
What if you could look down the road?

00:33:51.769 --> 00:34:01.769
Let's say two, four, six, or even 30 years into the future from this day of graduation.

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:06.460
It'd be nice to be able to do.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:17.460
Well, we're pleased and informed me that the teaching committee has included that this graduation special feature in connection with this graduation.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:22.460
It consists of four pre-recorded interviews of Gilead graduates.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:33.460
Currently in their assignments, see, and all four of the brothers are serving on branch committees or branch committee members.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:41.460
So the interviewers will begin now, and then another will follow each of the next three parts of the program.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.460
So we'll have a part and an interview.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:50.460
Now, first, we're going to travel to the country of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:58.460
Now, there we find a brother who graduated from the 138th class of Gilead.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:08.460
Listen as he explains how his Gilead training has helped him to work humbly with his fellow brothers and branch committee members.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.739
Enjoy the video.

00:35:12.739 --> 00:35:16.739
Brother and sister Gabi Chwa will be returning to Congo.

00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:25.739
It's difficult to find one word or expression that can sum up what I personally feel after this training in Gilead.

00:35:25.739 --> 00:35:33.739
The in-depth study of Jehovah's personality opened my eyes more fully to the way he values people.

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:43.739
And this has helped me to look for opportunities to strengthen others by placing their interests above my own.

00:35:43.739 --> 00:35:50.739
For example, my wife and I made ourselves available to support the brothers in cleaning a regional convention venue.

00:35:50.739 --> 00:35:53.739
They loved thinking that we were joking.

00:35:53.739 --> 00:35:57.739
And finally, they gave us humble tasks in cleaning.

00:35:57.739 --> 00:36:03.739
We did it with joy, and it allowed me to get to know the brothers and the circuits better.

00:36:03.739 --> 00:36:10.739
Taking these opportunities has a much more profound effect on the brothers than simply giving talks.

00:36:10.739 --> 00:36:16.739
Gilead has also helped me to show honor to the other members of the branch committee.

00:36:16.739 --> 00:36:20.739
On the committee, I serve the brothers of different age groups.

00:36:20.739 --> 00:36:29.739
While I feel that my normal inclination is to speak too much, I have learned from others on the committee how to humbly listen.

00:36:29.739 --> 00:36:36.739
For example, I had to present a concept to the branch committee and I put all my heart in the presentation.

00:36:36.739 --> 00:36:40.739
I was 100% sure it would be approved.

00:36:40.739 --> 00:36:44.739
Guess what? None of the options were approved.

00:36:44.739 --> 00:36:49.739
Honestly, inside myself, I was upset and ready to give up.

00:36:49.739 --> 00:36:58.739
What helped me was meditating on the example of another fellow branch committee member and how he reacted in times like this.

00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:09.739
Thanks to Gilead, I have learned to benefit from the qualities of each one of the brothers that work with no matter who they are or the experience they have.

00:37:09.739 --> 00:37:16.739
Jehovah's organization is made up of people from different cultures and backgrounds.

00:37:16.739 --> 00:37:24.739
And these differences can at times be to us like a huge gap that threatens our unity.

00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:36.739
In one of our lessons in Gilead, Matthew 5, verse 3 was used to show that the only way to bridge the gap is to be a spiritual person.

00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:51.739
So every time I'm overwhelmed by a feeling of inadequacy or I'm about to vent my frustrations, I reconnect to Jehovah and Jesus by studying the Bible and praying for help.

00:37:51.739 --> 00:38:01.739
I would definitely say that Gilead has given me all the tools I need to build the bridge of unity among Jehovah's people whenever I see a gap.

00:38:01.739 --> 00:38:12.619
And that tool is to feed my own spirituality.

00:38:12.619 --> 00:38:17.619
So a nice addition for the program here. Look forward to the other videos.

00:38:17.619 --> 00:38:29.619
Now, next we have a helper to the teaching committee and so for a long time, not picking on your age bill, but you look good.

00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:35.619
That's because his sand is right out there. So I try to be careful.

00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:46.280
And we always look forward to it, Brother Malinfon has to share with us his theme is boast in Jehovah.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:59.280
There are many people who love to boast. Politicians frequently boast about what they have done and what they promise to do for their constituents.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:07.280
And businessmen, they love to boast about how successful they are and how much money they are making.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:17.280
And athletes, you know, athletes are prideful. Many of them. And they boast about the events that they've been great in. They've won.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:26.280
In fact, you know, it's an interesting to note that in the highly competitive sports world, there is an expression for great achievers.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:36.280
The expression is goat, G-O-A-T, greatest of all time.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:42.280
Can you imagine people thinking that somehow they have been the greatest of all time?

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:49.280
When we hear the words greatest of all time, only one person comes to mind.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:55.280
He was the greatest man who ever lived truly the greatest of all time, Jesus Christ.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:04.280
And His greatness had nothing to do with politics, business, or playing games.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:13.280
But it had everything to do with praising Jehovah and boasting in Jehovah God.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:22.280
Jesus knew the council that's recorded at Jeremiah, chapter 9, verses 23 and 24.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:30.280
And this scripture, this text is beautiful. Jeremiah 9, 23 and 24. It says,

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:38.280
This is what Jehovah says. Let not the wise man boast about his wisdom.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:47.280
Let not the mighty man boast about his mightiness. And let not the rich man boast about his riches.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:57.280
But let the one boasting boast about this, that he has insight and knowledge of me,

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:06.280
that I am Jehovah, the one showing loyal love, justice, and righteousness in the earth.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:14.280
For in these things I take delight declares Jehovah. Isn't that beautiful?

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:19.280
So to boast in Jehovah really means that we take pride in our God, Jehovah.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:24.280
We're proud to bear His name. We rejoice in His reputation.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:30.280
We've got it in the scriptures, and we can see it in the organization today.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:42.280
And Jehovah takes delight when we boast in Him in His provisions, in His justice, His promises, and in His loyal love.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:50.280
So you students of the 150th class of Gilead, students soon to be graduates, I should add,

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:57.280
you've got a lot of reasons to boast in Jehovah God. And you know that throughout His ministry,

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:03.280
Jesus boasted in Jehovah. If you examine closely the scriptures and things that Jesus said,

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:10.280
you'll be able to see on many occasions how He boasted in Jehovah, just to give you one example.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:17.280
Remember when the rich young ruler approached Jesus, and he says, Oh, good teacher to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:27.280
And what did Jesus say? Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except one. God.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:33.280
That was a wonderful boast in Jehovah God, glorifying Him.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:39.280
So you students can boast in Jehovah, you've been doing it for a long time, but because now, though,

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:48.280
you have the privilege of going out, fulfilling an assignment, and showing how much you really do rely on Jehovah God.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:55.280
You can boast because you've experienced what Jesus declared a John chapter 8 verse 32.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:01.280
Jesus said, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. Well, that's something we all know.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:10.280
But don't minimize it. Appreciate the freedom you have right now because you know the truth.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:18.280
You've been set free from the lives of this world that hold people in bondage about false beliefs in life and death.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:25.280
You're free from human thinking that man is going to remedy the problems of this old world, and we know they can't do it.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:32.280
They haven't got the wherewithal to do it. No man can really direct his own steps, not even a perfect man.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:40.280
Jehovah can deliver his people, too, even where we're under severe persecution.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:45.280
Jehovah can intervene whenever he sees fit to do so.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:55.280
You can boast also in another thing that your slaves of Jehovah, now you're in a unique position because very few slaves are allowed to choose their master.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:03.280
But you've done it. You've chosen Jehovah God to be your master and to be a slave to him.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:10.280
And you know that Jehovah is with you, and you're happy, and you're willing slaves of Jehovah and of Jesus Christ.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:20.280
And it's a remarkable slavery, really, because no one has the freedom that we enjoy in our slavery to Jehovah God.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:31.280
We're so free and able to do so many things, serving Jehovah, but all the while, enjoying the good life that God has given to us.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:37.280
You can boast also in the brotherhood that you can gather together an assemblies to praise Jehovah God.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:43.280
And you know Jesus' words are true. Two or three are gathered in his name. There he is in our midst.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:55.280
So whether it's tens of thousands gathered together at a big convention or two or three gathering together secretly, you know that Jesus Christ is there with you.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:01.280
You can also boast in the great privilege you have through prayer. Just think about it for a moment.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:09.280
You can talk to the Almighty Creator of the universe personally. That is really something quite remarkable.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:20.280
But that is a privilege we have, and we boast in the privilege we have of addressing Jehovah, asking him for his help for his spirit to guide us, his strength and protection.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.280
And there's something else to that I find fascinating that you can boast in.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:34.280
You can boast it because you bear the fear inspiring name, Jehovah's Witnesses. Think about that.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:41.280
You're carrying Jehovah's name and how grateful really we are that back in 1931,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:51.280
the visible part of Jehovah's organization adopted the name Jehovah's Witnesses. And it's not just the name of a religion.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:46:01.280
It's a description of what people do. They live their lives to honor Jehovah God. They are living witnesses of the Creator.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:10.280
That is a privilege that we have. And that separates us from all religion on the earth. And there's no other religion that wants that name anyhow.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:19.280
But we're delighted that we have it. And they regret perhaps a few that they didn't listen to it or adopt it.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:25.280
We are God's name people. And at first Chronicles chapter 16 verse 10, it says this,

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:42.280
boast about his holy name, let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice. And if you examine synonyms, rejoice is a synonym in certain cases for boast to boast in Jehovah.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:52.280
And you can boast over the fact that Jehovah has allowed you a very special privilege. You can see the unseen.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:47:00.280
Not all people can do that. Division of many people in this world is limited just to just the physical that they see before them.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.280
But they can't see the unseen. I remember a man who said,

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:17.280
what has God ever done for me? That poor man, he was blind, totally blind spiritually. He enjoyed food, drink, the things the earth provides.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:29.280
But he couldn't see behind those physical things. He couldn't see that there had to be a wonderful Creator who provided all of these things for him.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:40.280
You can see the unseen. You see Jesus Christ ruling as king in the heavens. You see the new world that's coming. You see the resurrection of the dead.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:47.280
You see the functioning of Jehovah God's holy spirit on his people today.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:53.280
Finally, you know very well that we've only touched on a few things that you can boast in.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:48:01.280
But you want to continue doing that, boasting in Jehovah. And right now I know all of you students, you feel great.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:12.280
You've completed your course. You've done it. You're graduating from Gilead School. And now the doors of future activity are swinging open to you.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:22.280
So as you undertake your assignments, whatever and wherever they may be, do these things please.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:37.280
Stay humble, be happy and work hard and always esteem highly the great honor and privilege you have to boast in Jehovah.

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:52.500
Thanks. Thanks Bill as usual. We'd be thoroughly enjoyed your talk.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:49:03.500
Now our second pre-recorded interview of a Gilead graduate. Now when his assignment takes us to Ecuador, South America.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:12.500
This brother serves on the branch committee in Ecuador and he graduated from the one hundred and forty second class of Gilead.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:21.500
Notice as he explains, notice the positive impact that Gilead graduates had on him from his childhood.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:28.500
And how his training while at Gilead helped him to appreciate what is truly important.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:33.650
Brother and sister Topia will be going back to Ecuador.

00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:43.309
Gilead training is a beautiful way that Jehovah is using divine education to train people not only for their benefit.

00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:54.309
Having Gilead graduate all around the world, we are sharing the impact of this school for the brothers and sisters who are working with his students and future graduates.

00:49:54.309 --> 00:50:00.309
It was Gilead missionaries who first introduced the truth to my parents and helped them to the point of baptism.

00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:07.309
So I have very pleasant memories of Gilead graduate being around my home since childhood.

00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:15.309
The greatest legacy I received from my Gilead training is the privilege of getting to know Jehovah's beautiful personality more deeply.

00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:26.309
I've been studying the Bible since childhood but doing so with the help of the Gilead instructors really helped me to make connections that I had never put together before.

00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:33.309
You don't go to Gilead to learn abilities which can sometimes overshadow spiritual qualities.

00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:39.309
Instead, a very important part of Gilead training is the study of Christ's personality.

00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:49.309
You know, Jesus is most remembered not so much for his abilities but for how he perfectly reflected the beautiful qualities of his father.

00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:56.309
While getting to know Jehovah and Jesus better, I was able to better see where I need to improve.

00:50:56.309 --> 00:51:09.309
Of course, it can be discouraging at times to not always act as they do but that has helped me to have the proper perspective and rely on Jehovah begging him for his guidance while waiting for his help.

00:51:09.309 --> 00:51:18.309
One of the best lessons I took away from Gilead is that people are more important than tasks or deadlines.

00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:25.309
They are the reason for our assignment and that is why I need to show my love to my brothers and sisters.

00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:36.309
Honestly, I don't feel at all qualified for this assignment but I learned that if Jehovah signs us a certain task, for sure he will give us what we need to accomplish.

00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:45.230
That was very nice. I certainly appreciate it.

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:59.539
Now, we have one of the Gilead instructors next, Brother James Cawthon, and he's chosen as his subject, thriving in the trenches.

00:51:59.539 --> 00:52:09.539
Located in the Western Pacific Ocean, the Mariana Trench is the deepest known location on Earth.

00:52:09.539 --> 00:52:17.539
To help you get an idea of its depth, imagine that you could stack the Empire State Building in the trench.

00:52:17.539 --> 00:52:26.539
It would take 25 such buildings to go from the bottom of the trench before you would reach sea level.

00:52:26.539 --> 00:52:30.539
It is also one of the deadliest places on Earth.

00:52:30.539 --> 00:52:34.539
Why is it? In a word, pressure.

00:52:34.539 --> 00:52:41.539
The crushing pressure, water pressure on the floor of the trench is more than eight tons per square inch.

00:52:41.539 --> 00:52:50.539
Now, to give you some idea, that would be the equivalent of having about 50 jumbo jets on top of you.

00:52:50.539 --> 00:52:58.539
Surely, no life could live in that trench. At least that's what scientists thought.

00:52:59.539 --> 00:53:10.539
But they were wrong. When they finally developed a submersible that would take them down into the trench, they found life teaming.

00:53:10.539 --> 00:53:17.539
And not just surviving, but thriving. Now, how is that possible?

00:53:17.539 --> 00:53:24.539
It's possible, friends, because Jehovah, our creator, knows how to deal with pressure.

00:53:24.539 --> 00:53:28.539
Jehovah knows how to deal with pressure.

00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:33.539
And this is a fact that should be comforting to all of us. Why?

00:53:33.539 --> 00:53:38.539
Because the pressure in this system of things is increasing.

00:53:38.539 --> 00:53:43.539
The strain, stress, anxiety for all people at all levels.

00:53:43.539 --> 00:53:49.539
And the Bible tells us that these pressures are likely to increase in the near future.

00:53:49.539 --> 00:53:55.539
But the good news is that Jehovah does more than just equip his servants to survive.

00:53:55.539 --> 00:53:59.539
You can actually make one thrive.

00:53:59.539 --> 00:54:04.539
Here's an example. Try this on for pressure.

00:54:05.539 --> 00:54:08.539
You're surrounded by men who hate you.

00:54:08.539 --> 00:54:16.539
In addition to hunting you down with a view to taking your life, they've spread slander and lies about you everywhere.

00:54:16.539 --> 00:54:24.539
Your name has become a reproach. When people see you coming, they turn and run the other way.

00:54:24.539 --> 00:54:31.539
Because they feel that your time is short and they don't want to be caught in the crosshairs.

00:54:31.539 --> 00:54:36.539
Wherever you look, it seems like terror is waiting for you.

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:40.539
And as a result of these problems, you're struggling with depression.

00:54:40.539 --> 00:54:43.539
Your own sins are staring you in the face.

00:54:43.539 --> 00:54:46.539
The whole experience has taken a toll on your health.

00:54:46.539 --> 00:54:52.539
You can't sleep. Your stamina is shot. Your body is wasting away.

00:54:52.539 --> 00:54:56.539
Now, that was David's situation.

00:54:56.539 --> 00:55:01.539
You can read about it in Psalm 31 verses 10 through 13.

00:55:01.539 --> 00:55:04.539
The pressure was real. No question about it.

00:55:04.539 --> 00:55:09.539
David's feelings were real. No question about that.

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:15.539
But something else was very real. And that was Jehovah.

00:55:15.539 --> 00:55:20.539
And so Jehovah is where David would turn to.

00:55:20.539 --> 00:55:24.539
Let's turn to his words in Psalm 31.

00:55:24.539 --> 00:55:33.210
Psalm 31 and note his humble prayer beginning in verse 14.

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:37.210
He said, but I trust in you, O Jehovah.

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:40.210
I declare you are my God.

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:42.210
My days are in your hand.

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:46.210
Rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from those persecuting me.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:49.210
Make your face shine upon your servant.

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:52.210
Save me by your loyal love.

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:59.869
David's life experiences had taught him the value of turning to God

00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:02.869
and pouring out his heart in times of trial.

00:56:02.869 --> 00:56:10.869
And he absolutely knew that prayer coupled with implicit trust and patience

00:56:10.869 --> 00:56:13.869
would always bring Jehovah's blessing.

00:56:13.869 --> 00:56:18.869
And you see, friends, the key to not just surviving,

00:56:18.869 --> 00:56:21.869
but thriving under extreme pressure

00:56:21.869 --> 00:56:27.869
is to have the internal pressure equal to the external.

00:56:27.869 --> 00:56:34.869
And when this is true, there is no amount of pressure that can press you.

00:56:34.869 --> 00:56:36.869
So in a spiritual sense,

00:56:36.869 --> 00:56:39.869
and David received the internal fortitude,

00:56:39.869 --> 00:56:43.869
or at some say, the intestinal fortitude,

00:56:43.869 --> 00:56:45.869
meaning the courage and the strength,

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:49.869
that would make him equal to the pressure weighing in on him.

00:56:49.869 --> 00:56:52.869
And how do we know that he received that?

00:56:52.869 --> 00:56:56.869
Well, let's go back to Psalm 31 for just a moment.

00:56:56.869 --> 00:57:02.869
If you look at verse 21, notice now the change.

00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:07.869
He says, it made Jehovah be praised for in a wonderful way

00:57:07.869 --> 00:57:12.869
he has shown his loyal love to me in a besieged city.

00:57:12.869 --> 00:57:15.869
And then verse 23,

00:57:15.869 --> 00:57:18.869
love Jehovah all you who are loyal to him.

00:57:18.869 --> 00:57:20.869
Jehovah protects the faithful.

00:57:20.869 --> 00:57:22.869
And finally, verse 24,

00:57:22.869 --> 00:57:26.869
be courageous and may your heart be strong.

00:57:26.869 --> 00:57:32.150
All you who are waiting for Jehovah.

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:40.150
So you see, David received an answer to his prayer.

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:45.150
He, his prayer, coupled with his faith and his patience.

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:48.150
He was waiting on Jehovah.

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.150
And Jehovah helped him not only to survive,

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:52.150
but to thrive.

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.150
And he added joy to David,

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:59.150
because David went on to find joy and happiness

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:03.150
in his responsibilities and privileges.

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:05.150
So what do we learn?

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:07.150
Number one,

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.150
David was able to face the pressure

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:13.150
because he had an unshakable faith in Jehovah.

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:15.150
And number two,

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:17.150
David's relationship with Jehovah

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:21.150
brought him the patience to wait on God.

00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:23.150
And number three,

00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:27.150
when a loyal servant of God humbly turns to Jehovah for help,

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:30.150
it is Jehovah's own loyal love

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:34.150
that has the effect of equalizing the pressure.

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:38.429
And you know there's something else.

00:58:38.429 --> 00:58:41.429
David's experience in the trench

00:58:41.429 --> 00:58:44.429
reached further than he ever knew.

00:58:44.429 --> 00:58:48.429
Jonah, well in the belly of the great fish,

00:58:48.429 --> 00:58:52.429
cited words from Psalm 31.

00:58:52.429 --> 00:58:57.429
Jeremiah, who had many trials sometimes in his life,

00:58:57.429 --> 00:59:01.429
often echoed phrases from Psalm 31.

00:59:01.429 --> 00:59:04.429
And Jesus Christ himself,

00:59:04.429 --> 00:59:06.429
the very son of God,

00:59:06.429 --> 00:59:08.429
his final words from the stake,

00:59:08.429 --> 00:59:12.429
was a quotation from Psalm 31.5.

00:59:12.429 --> 00:59:16.429
So Jesus must have meditated on this many times.

00:59:16.429 --> 00:59:18.429
And so friends like David,

00:59:18.429 --> 00:59:20.429
Jonah, Jeremiah, Jesus,

00:59:20.429 --> 00:59:22.429
and many, many others,

00:59:22.429 --> 00:59:25.429
they all trusted in Jehovah

00:59:25.429 --> 00:59:29.429
and Jehovah never failed to make them equal to the pressure.

00:59:29.429 --> 00:59:32.429
He'll do the same for you.

00:59:32.429 --> 00:59:35.429
And so in conclusion,

00:59:35.429 --> 00:59:40.429
it really doesn't matter how great the pressure is.

00:59:40.429 --> 00:59:44.429
It only matters where the pressure lies.

00:59:44.429 --> 00:59:49.429
Do not let it come between you and Jehovah

00:59:49.429 --> 00:59:51.429
and your worship and service.

00:59:51.429 --> 00:59:54.429
Don't let it come between you.

00:59:54.429 --> 00:59:57.429
Because then the external pressure

00:59:57.429 --> 01:00:00.429
will only continue to move you closer

01:00:00.429 --> 01:00:03.429
to your heavenly Father.

01:00:03.429 --> 01:00:07.429
The life that flourishes in the Mariana Tranche gives

01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:09.429
a positive example,

01:00:09.429 --> 01:00:12.429
a beautiful example of Jehovah's limitless ability

01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:15.429
to help his creation deal with pressure.

01:00:15.429 --> 01:00:17.429
Prayer, trust, and patience

01:00:17.429 --> 01:00:21.429
will always be rewarded by Jehovah.

01:00:21.429 --> 01:00:24.429
Relief will come.

01:00:24.429 --> 01:00:27.429
So remain close to your heavenly Father

01:00:27.429 --> 01:00:32.429
and you will not just survive the pressure in the Tranche.

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:43.090
You will thrive spiritually.

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:47.090
Thank you, Brother Carlton, for your nice, insightful comments,

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:49.090
much appreciated.

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:53.090
Now our third interview involves a brother who serves as a member

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:57.090
of the Branch Committee in Sri Lanka.

01:00:57.090 --> 01:01:02.090
He graduated from the 146th class of Gilead,

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:05.090
so just four back.

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:08.090
Listen carefully as he explains how Gilead training helped him

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:12.090
to see things about his personality

01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:14.090
that he needed to refine

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:16.090
if he'd become a stabilizing

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:18.090
and strengthening influence

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:22.559
in his branch territory.

01:01:22.559 --> 01:01:25.559
Brother and sister Sivakumaran will be returning to Sri Lanka.

01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:31.760
In Gilead, wonderful thing is you get to learn

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.760
from the beginning Jehovah's dealing

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.760
with humankind, the vast history.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.760
Learning that is humbling.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.760
How tiny I am.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.760
And the small role that I play in Jehovah's organization

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.760
is a realization before going to Gilead.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.760
I thought I was a loving person

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.760
because we always think we want to be loving people.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.760
But during Gilead, it was made away to me

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.760
that I had a spiritual blind spot.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.760
There were brothers and sisters I didn't really notice before.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.760
And that kind of taught me an important lesson.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.760
It's not about giving talks

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.760
but really it's personal attention that brothers need.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.760
So I need to give them my time.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.760
And I need to help them understand that Jehovah

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.760
Jehovah loves them very much.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.760
You know, one word that stands out

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.760
throughout the training is mercy.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.760
Israel made many mistakes

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.760
but Jehovah never picked on them for their mistake.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.760
He just wanted them to come back to him.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.760
And that was a lovely lesson.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.760
And as an overseer, I need to ask

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.760
a question that always rings in my ears.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.760
Am I going to criticize?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.760
Or am I going to comment?

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.760
Just to give you an example, before going to Gilead,

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.760
as a home overseer, I was strict

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.760
and came across stingy, to be honest.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.760
But during Gilead, it was made away to me.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.760
I need to change.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.760
I need to be more generous

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.760
and I need to be merciful.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.760
I vividly remember one instructor said,

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.760
saying no to everything can be addictive.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.760
And it makes for an easy way out.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.760
But we were admonished to say, yes,

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.760
whenever we can, and to help the brothers.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.760
Something of Gilead, I can't do better than Jesus.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.760
Love Jehovah.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.760
Love people.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.760
That's the whole training of Gilead.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.760
And some of my feelings,

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.760
and every time I look at them,

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.760
think about Gilead,

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.760
I have a long way to go,

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.760
to put all those details into practice

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.760
and to change myself, to fit Jehovah.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.760
So, yeah, I have a long way to go,

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:54.349
so I'm working on it.

01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:56.349
So we pray that all of you,

01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:58.349
soon to be graduates,

01:03:58.349 --> 01:04:00.349
to examine yourself,

01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:03.349
and ensure you have a strengthening effect

01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:05.349
on the brotherhood.

01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:08.349
Those nice humble expressions he shared with us.

01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:13.349
Now let's turn our attention to another one of the Gilead instructors

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:17.349
and a helper to the teaching committee, Mark Numer.

01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:19.349
The title of his talk is,

01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:21.349
I cling to you.

01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:24.349
You hold on to me.

01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:28.780
For the Numer.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.780
In this talk,

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:36.780
we want you to understand the sustaining power of loyal love.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.780
Because it is this quality,

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.780
loyal love, and its power

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.780
that will help you face future trials

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.780
and challenges with confidence in Jehovah.

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:54.780
Well, you perhaps remember the definition of loyal love

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.780
from a written review,

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.780
but it's this.

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.780
It is love motivated by a strong commitment

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:04.780
and a deep attachment.

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:07.780
And here's how King David described loyal love

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.780
that existed between him and Jehovah.

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.780
He said at Psalm 63-8,

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:15.780
I cling to you.

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:19.780
Your right hand keeps hold fast on me.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.780
Now this is loyal love.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.780
I cling to you.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.780
You hold on to me.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.780
Now in the first century, a woman.

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.780
A woman who set an outstanding example

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:37.780
of clinging to Jehovah is Anna.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.780
How so?

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:40.780
Let's find out.

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.780
We open our Bibles to Luke chapter 2.

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.780
We're going to read verse 36 and 37,

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.780
and see what lesson we can learn

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:54.340
and apply to you.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.340
Now there was a prophetess, Anna,

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:59.340
the daughter of Fanuel, of Asher's tribe.

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.340
This woman was well along in years

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:04.340
and had lived with her husband for seven years

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.340
after they were married.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:10.340
And she was a widow now 84 years old.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.340
She was never missing from the temple,

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.340
rendering sacred service day and night,

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.340
with fasting and supplications.

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.340
Well, here we have it.

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:24.340
Everything we know about Anna is right here.

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.340
Luke recorded it.

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.340
She was 84 years old,

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:31.340
when Luke introduces her to us.

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.340
Likely, she hadn't lived long enough

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.340
to become a follower of Jesus

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.340
to be anointed with Holy Spirit

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:42.340
or to enjoy preaching the good news of the kingdom.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.340
That's it.

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.340
If we stop right there.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.340
But what if we don't?

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.340
What if we dig deeper?

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.340
What will we learn that will help you?

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.340
Well, let's do that.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:01.340
Anna was born about 86 BCE.

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:05.690
When she was 23 years old,

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:10.690
Jerusalem was filled with violence and divisions.

01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:12.690
Jewish leaders, such as the Maccabees,

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:13.690
were at war.

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:16.690
Roman forces under the leadership of a soldier named Pompey,

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.690
came to restore order,

01:07:18.690 --> 01:07:19.690
and in the process,

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:24.690
some 12,000 Jews reportedly died.

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:26.690
It is possible that

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:31.690
Anna's husband was one of these victims.

01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:34.690
Then when Anna was 47 years old,

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:37.690
the Romans appointed Herod as king of Judea.

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:38.690
Herod?

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:41.690
This man was not a descendant of David.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.690
He was not even in Israelite.

01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:45.690
He was an itemite.

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:49.690
The itemites were sworn enemies of true worship.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.690
Now on top of that,

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:54.690
the hypocritical Jewish religious leaders

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:56.690
made life hard for people,

01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:59.690
including widows like Anna.

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:03.690
So now Anna watches as Jehovah's house of prayer.

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:08.690
The place she cherished became a cave of robbers.

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:12.690
Pure worship is withering on the vine.

01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:14.690
What will Anna do?

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.689
She could have been stumbled.

01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:18.689
She could have reasoned.

01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:21.689
I supported true worship on my life.

01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:23.689
I believe the Messiah would come,

01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:25.689
the prophecies would come.

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:27.689
I go to the temple every day.

01:08:27.689 --> 01:08:29.689
I've done everything right.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.689
But things have only gotten worse.

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:33.689
God lets my husband die.

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:35.689
An itemite is rebuilding the temple.

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:37.689
What's happening?

01:08:37.689 --> 01:08:39.689
Has Jehovah left us?

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:42.689
Should I leave to?

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:44.689
Anna could have given up.

01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:46.689
Walked away, became bitter.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.689
But she didn't.

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:50.689
Why? Why?

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:54.689
It was their roots of her loyal love.

01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:57.689
That sustaining power of loyal love went deep

01:08:57.689 --> 01:08:59.689
and it wrapped around Jehovah.

01:08:59.689 --> 01:09:02.689
And she had the power to keep clinging to him

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:05.689
under those circumstances.

01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:07.689
Anna was determined to serve Jehovah

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:10.689
to the best of her ability.

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:12.689
What did she do again?

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:15.689
Looking at verse 37,

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:19.689
she was never missing from the temple.

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:23.579
She was in the right place,

01:09:23.579 --> 01:09:26.579
rendering sacred service day and night,

01:09:26.579 --> 01:09:29.579
doing the right thing,

01:09:29.579 --> 01:09:31.579
with fasting and supplications

01:09:31.579 --> 01:09:34.579
with the right attitude.

01:09:34.579 --> 01:09:37.579
She was doing the right thing,

01:09:37.579 --> 01:09:39.579
in the right place,

01:09:39.579 --> 01:09:41.579
with the right attitude.

01:09:41.579 --> 01:09:45.579
Nothing could stop this seemingly fragile servant of God

01:09:45.579 --> 01:09:49.579
from clinging to her closest friend, Jehovah.

01:09:49.579 --> 01:09:52.579
In effect, Anna was saying,

01:09:52.579 --> 01:09:56.579
I cling to you, Jehovah,

01:09:56.579 --> 01:10:00.819
and her loyal love was noticed.

01:10:00.819 --> 01:10:03.819
Chapter 2 and verse 38,

01:10:03.819 --> 01:10:06.819
it reveals that Anna was present

01:10:06.819 --> 01:10:10.819
when the baby Jesus was brought to the temple.

01:10:10.819 --> 01:10:12.819
And when she saw that baby,

01:10:12.819 --> 01:10:15.819
what did she begin to do in verse 38?

01:10:15.819 --> 01:10:17.819
It says she came near,

01:10:17.819 --> 01:10:19.819
she began giving thanks to God,

01:10:19.819 --> 01:10:22.819
speaking about the child to all who are waiting

01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:24.819
for Jerusalem's deliverance.

01:10:24.819 --> 01:10:27.819
Can you sense her joy?

01:10:27.819 --> 01:10:29.819
Can you feel the joy she had

01:10:29.819 --> 01:10:32.819
at seeing and perhaps even holding that little baby

01:10:32.819 --> 01:10:33.819
the future Messiah?

01:10:33.819 --> 01:10:36.819
This was something that this elderly woman

01:10:36.819 --> 01:10:39.819
had never expected in her lifetime.

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:43.819
The child in front of her was proof,

01:10:43.819 --> 01:10:46.819
tangible proof, concrete evidence

01:10:46.819 --> 01:10:50.819
that Jehovah had not abandoned his people,

01:10:50.819 --> 01:10:54.819
and he did not abandon Anna.

01:10:54.819 --> 01:10:58.819
So not only had Anna clung to Jehovah,

01:10:58.819 --> 01:11:02.819
Jehovah held on to her,

01:11:02.819 --> 01:11:08.819
and and rewarded her.

01:11:08.819 --> 01:11:13.260
This is loyal love.

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.260
Anna's faithful record

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:21.260
is so well known that some 50 years later,

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:26.260
50 years later or so Luke was compelled to write about her.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.260
Where did Luke get his information?

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:30.260
Who did he talk to?

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.260
Did he talk to Mary interview her

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:33.260
or some of the older ones?

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.260
There was this woman, Anna.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.260
She was at the temple.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:38.260
She would never leave.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.260
We don't know.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.260
But what we do know

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.260
is that Jehovah inspired Luke

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:47.260
to record and to document her life

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:52.260
in his word so that we could be taught lessons.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:55.260
And here we are some 2000 years later.

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.260
And we are using her life

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.260
as an example of commitment

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.260
and unbreakable integrity

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.260
for you students to imitate.

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:12.069
So what can you learn from Anna's example?

01:12:12.069 --> 01:12:15.069
You may suffer loss of one kind or another.

01:12:15.069 --> 01:12:17.069
You will come face to face

01:12:17.069 --> 01:12:19.069
with the imperfections of others.

01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:22.069
Your feelings may get hurt

01:12:22.069 --> 01:12:24.069
and you might find yourself coping

01:12:24.069 --> 01:12:26.069
with an unexpected change in your life

01:12:26.069 --> 01:12:28.069
that is not pleasant.

01:12:28.069 --> 01:12:31.069
Or you may feel that you're a victim

01:12:31.069 --> 01:12:34.069
of an injustice or a serious misunderstanding

01:12:34.069 --> 01:12:37.069
from within the organization.

01:12:37.069 --> 01:12:39.069
What will you do?

01:12:39.069 --> 01:12:42.069
This is what you will do.

01:12:42.069 --> 01:12:44.069
You will cling to Jehovah

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:47.069
and you will experience him holding on to you.

01:12:47.069 --> 01:12:49.069
You cling to him.

01:12:49.069 --> 01:12:52.069
He holds on to you.

01:12:52.069 --> 01:12:54.069
For example,

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:56.069
I recall a time when a brother serving

01:12:56.069 --> 01:12:58.069
in a foreign field

01:12:58.069 --> 01:13:00.069
due to a misunderstanding lost

01:13:00.069 --> 01:13:03.069
of his privileges as an elder.

01:13:03.069 --> 01:13:05.069
And he felt the decision was unfair.

01:13:05.069 --> 01:13:07.069
He was deeply hurt.

01:13:07.069 --> 01:13:09.069
But his wife, he and his wife

01:13:09.069 --> 01:13:11.069
never stopped clinging to Jehovah

01:13:11.069 --> 01:13:14.069
and their spiritual routine.

01:13:14.069 --> 01:13:16.069
Then at a regional convention,

01:13:16.069 --> 01:13:17.069
a brother approached him

01:13:17.069 --> 01:13:19.069
and thanked him for the talk

01:13:19.069 --> 01:13:22.069
that he gave on the program.

01:13:22.069 --> 01:13:23.069
Well, he volunteered

01:13:23.069 --> 01:13:25.069
in the cleaning department,

01:13:25.069 --> 01:13:27.069
but he hadn't given a talk.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.069
Then the brother,

01:13:29.069 --> 01:13:31.069
I said to this former elder,

01:13:31.069 --> 01:13:33.069
when I see your smile

01:13:33.069 --> 01:13:35.069
in positive attitude,

01:13:35.069 --> 01:13:37.069
yes, you gave a talk

01:13:37.069 --> 01:13:39.069
and it was on loyalty

01:13:39.069 --> 01:13:43.069
and it was loud and clear.

01:13:43.069 --> 01:13:45.069
So the former elder now relates,

01:13:45.069 --> 01:13:48.069
the experience taught me and my wife

01:13:48.069 --> 01:13:50.069
that every challenger

01:13:50.069 --> 01:13:52.069
or misfortune does not need

01:13:52.069 --> 01:13:54.069
to represent a threat

01:13:54.069 --> 01:13:57.069
to our spiritual well-being.

01:13:57.069 --> 01:13:59.069
We've come to view rejection failure

01:13:59.069 --> 01:14:01.069
or being misunderstood

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:03.069
as normal episodes

01:14:03.069 --> 01:14:06.069
in the lives of competent, healthy people.

01:14:07.069 --> 01:14:09.069
Instead of being crushed,

01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:11.069
we grew.

01:14:11.069 --> 01:14:13.069
You see, the couple looked

01:14:13.069 --> 01:14:15.069
beyond their hardships,

01:14:15.069 --> 01:14:18.069
and they clung to Jehovah.

01:14:18.069 --> 01:14:22.069
How by imitating Anna,

01:14:22.069 --> 01:14:25.069
they were never missing

01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:27.069
from true worship

01:14:27.069 --> 01:14:30.069
in the right place,

01:14:30.069 --> 01:14:33.069
rendering sacred service day and night

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:36.069
doing the right thing,

01:14:36.069 --> 01:14:38.069
with fasting and supplications

01:14:38.069 --> 01:14:40.069
and sometimes those supplications

01:14:40.069 --> 01:14:42.069
involved tears,

01:14:42.069 --> 01:14:45.069
but with the right attitude

01:14:45.069 --> 01:14:48.069
and Jehovah held on to them

01:14:48.069 --> 01:14:50.069
and never let go.

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.069
The brother is still serving

01:14:52.069 --> 01:14:54.069
in the foreign field,

01:14:54.069 --> 01:14:56.069
he's an elder again

01:14:56.069 --> 01:15:01.279
and giving memorable talks.

01:15:01.279 --> 01:15:02.279
So what do we want you

01:15:02.279 --> 01:15:06.939
to remember from this talk?

01:15:06.939 --> 01:15:09.939
We want you to remember this.

01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:11.939
When you come face to face

01:15:11.939 --> 01:15:14.939
with future trials and you will

01:15:14.939 --> 01:15:16.939
or challenges in your life

01:15:16.939 --> 01:15:17.939
and you will,

01:15:17.939 --> 01:15:23.270
this is what happens in life.

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:25.270
Be in the right place.

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:28.270
Do the right thing

01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:31.270
with the right attitude

01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:33.270
by doing this.

01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:35.270
You declare Jehovah,

01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:37.270
I cling to you,

01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:38.270
and I trust you

01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:47.569
hold on to me.

01:15:47.569 --> 01:15:48.569
Thank you.

01:15:48.569 --> 01:15:49.569
Very much, brother,

01:15:49.569 --> 01:15:50.569
new mayor.

01:15:50.569 --> 01:15:52.569
Anna is a beautiful example

01:15:52.569 --> 01:15:53.569
for all of us,

01:15:53.569 --> 01:15:55.569
no doubt about it.

01:15:55.569 --> 01:15:57.569
Now, our final pre-recorded

01:15:57.569 --> 01:15:59.569
interview takes us

01:15:59.569 --> 01:16:01.569
to the West African country

01:16:01.569 --> 01:16:03.569
of Ghana,

01:16:03.569 --> 01:16:05.569
where David and Lynn Jones

01:16:05.569 --> 01:16:07.569
currently serve.

01:16:07.569 --> 01:16:09.569
Upon their graduation

01:16:09.569 --> 01:16:11.569
from the 95th class

01:16:11.569 --> 01:16:13.569
September of 1993,

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:14.569
they were assigned

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:16.569
to the country of Kenya,

01:16:16.569 --> 01:16:17.569
East Africa,

01:16:17.569 --> 01:16:19.569
they also served in Berundi

01:16:19.569 --> 01:16:20.569
for eight years.

01:16:20.569 --> 01:16:22.569
Presently,

01:16:22.569 --> 01:16:23.569
they served in Ghana,

01:16:23.569 --> 01:16:24.569
where brother Jones

01:16:24.569 --> 01:16:25.569
serves as a member

01:16:25.569 --> 01:16:28.569
of the branch committee there.

01:16:28.569 --> 01:16:29.569
Now, you might remember this couple

01:16:29.569 --> 01:16:31.569
when you see the video

01:16:31.569 --> 01:16:34.569
because their class was highlighted

01:16:34.569 --> 01:16:35.569
in the video

01:16:35.569 --> 01:16:38.569
to the ends of the earth,

01:16:38.569 --> 01:16:40.569
which marked the 50th anniversary

01:16:40.569 --> 01:16:42.569
of Watchtower Bible School

01:16:42.569 --> 01:16:43.569
of Gillian.

01:16:43.569 --> 01:16:47.569
It was a very enlightening video, for sure.

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:49.569
Although the purpose

01:16:49.569 --> 01:16:51.569
of the Gillian School training

01:16:51.569 --> 01:16:53.569
has changed since then,

01:16:53.569 --> 01:16:55.569
it's clear from

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:57.569
their heartfelt comments

01:16:57.569 --> 01:16:58.569
that they've proven

01:16:58.569 --> 01:17:00.569
to be a stabilizing

01:17:00.569 --> 01:17:02.569
and strengthening influence

01:17:02.569 --> 01:17:04.569
where they have served.

01:17:04.569 --> 01:17:09.100
So enjoy the video.

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:10.100
This is the day

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.100
when we hand out assignments

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.100
to all of these students.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:14.100
Good morning.

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.100
We knew that we were going

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.100
to get our assignment.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.100
We went down to morning worship,

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.100
and then we had to line up,

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.100
and we were waiting to get our assignment,

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.100
and my stomach was churning,

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.100
and I felt really sick.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.100
Sick with excitement,

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.100
as well as the fact that you knew

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.100
that whatever brother Jaros said,

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.100
the next sentence

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.100
that came out of his mouth

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.100
would determine the rest of your life.

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.659
It's hard to imagine

01:17:37.659 --> 01:17:38.659
that 28 years

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:41.659
have gone by since our initial assignment,

01:17:41.659 --> 01:17:43.659
but Gillian training really helped us

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.659
to understand that things

01:17:45.659 --> 01:17:46.659
wouldn't always be easy,

01:17:46.659 --> 01:17:48.659
and that when things weren't easy,

01:17:48.659 --> 01:17:49.659
that we should never

01:17:49.659 --> 01:17:51.659
overreact to situations,

01:17:51.659 --> 01:17:52.659
but to keep calm

01:17:52.659 --> 01:17:53.659
and trust in Jehovah.

01:17:53.659 --> 01:17:55.659
I think one of the outstanding sections

01:17:55.659 --> 01:17:57.659
of Gillian for me was the section

01:17:57.659 --> 01:17:59.659
dealing with the gospels

01:17:59.659 --> 01:18:00.659
and Jesus Christ.

01:18:00.659 --> 01:18:02.659
Jesus was always kind.

01:18:02.659 --> 01:18:05.659
He was always reasonable

01:18:05.659 --> 01:18:07.659
in his dealings with people,

01:18:07.659 --> 01:18:08.659
and so in class,

01:18:08.659 --> 01:18:11.659
the emphasis was not on head knowledge,

01:18:11.659 --> 01:18:13.659
but how we can imitate

01:18:13.659 --> 01:18:15.659
Jesus Christ in our dealings with others.

01:18:15.659 --> 01:18:17.659
And I remember a couple of phrases,

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:20.659
people over productivity,

01:18:20.659 --> 01:18:22.659
and the kind thing is always

01:18:22.659 --> 01:18:24.659
the right thing to do.

01:18:24.659 --> 01:18:25.659
These lessons are still with me,

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:27.659
all these years later.

01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:29.659
We were taught how to study,

01:18:29.659 --> 01:18:32.659
and it helped us to study

01:18:32.659 --> 01:18:35.659
in a way that would build a pool

01:18:35.659 --> 01:18:38.659
or a foundation of principles

01:18:38.659 --> 01:18:40.659
so that when we had a trial,

01:18:40.659 --> 01:18:41.659
we would have somewhere to go

01:18:41.659 --> 01:18:43.659
and dip into that pool of principles

01:18:43.659 --> 01:18:45.659
that would apply to any situation

01:18:45.659 --> 01:18:47.659
that you might face.

01:18:47.659 --> 01:18:48.659
And it's true,

01:18:48.659 --> 01:18:49.659
at the time you go through,

01:18:49.659 --> 01:18:51.659
you're taking in all the knowledge,

01:18:51.659 --> 01:18:53.659
you don't know when and where you're going to use that,

01:18:53.659 --> 01:18:56.659
but it teaches you the method of,

01:18:56.659 --> 01:18:58.659
let's store all this in the bank,

01:18:58.659 --> 01:18:59.659
and then when I need it,

01:18:59.659 --> 01:19:01.659
I know where I can go and pick it from.

01:19:01.659 --> 01:19:03.659
One example that comes to mind

01:19:03.659 --> 01:19:06.659
is a lecture we had that highlighted

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:08.659
Romans chapter 15 and verse 3,

01:19:08.659 --> 01:19:10.659
where it talked about how

01:19:10.659 --> 01:19:13.659
even the Christ did not please himself.

01:19:13.659 --> 01:19:15.659
So, thinking about that lecture,

01:19:15.659 --> 01:19:17.659
it makes me think of a situation.

01:19:17.659 --> 01:19:19.659
When we'd been in the field missionaries

01:19:19.659 --> 01:19:20.659
for a couple of years,

01:19:20.659 --> 01:19:23.659
we were invited to go into the traveling work.

01:19:23.659 --> 01:19:26.659
So, I was thinking to myself,

01:19:26.659 --> 01:19:28.659
can I really do this?

01:19:28.659 --> 01:19:30.659
But then I reflected back on that lecture,

01:19:30.659 --> 01:19:33.659
Romans 15, 3, the Christ didn't please himself.

01:19:33.659 --> 01:19:34.659
It's not about me,

01:19:34.659 --> 01:19:36.659
it's about doing Jehovah's will,

01:19:36.659 --> 01:19:38.659
it's about the people you serve.

01:19:38.659 --> 01:19:40.659
Reflecting on that helped me to see myself

01:19:40.659 --> 01:19:42.659
in that big picture and realise,

01:19:42.659 --> 01:19:45.659
no, if Jesus could do that,

01:19:45.659 --> 01:19:47.659
then this is what I have to do first.

01:19:47.659 --> 01:19:49.659
I put the brothers and sisters first,

01:19:49.659 --> 01:19:51.659
and we thoroughly enjoyed being in that circuit.

01:19:51.659 --> 01:19:53.659
I don't even know why I was so worried

01:19:53.659 --> 01:19:55.659
because at the end of three years,

01:19:55.659 --> 01:19:59.619
we didn't even want to leave.

01:19:59.619 --> 01:20:03.619
The impact of Gilead is not fully appreciated in the moment.

01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:06.619
But as the years have gone by,

01:20:06.619 --> 01:20:09.619
I do find myself reflecting on the lessons

01:20:09.619 --> 01:20:12.619
that were taught during that class.

01:20:12.619 --> 01:20:16.619
And I see how it's shaped the way I think can feel

01:20:16.619 --> 01:20:18.619
all these years later.

01:20:18.619 --> 01:20:20.619
So, I would say, yeah,

01:20:20.619 --> 01:20:26.619
it's had a life or a personality changing effect on me.

01:20:27.619 --> 01:20:29.619
When I think back of standing in that line,

01:20:29.619 --> 01:20:34.619
I mean, it is very vivid in my memory of how I felt

01:20:34.619 --> 01:20:38.619
and my stomach was definitely churning,

01:20:38.619 --> 01:20:40.619
but these 28 years,

01:20:40.619 --> 01:20:43.619
I have not regretted one single minute of it.

01:20:43.619 --> 01:20:45.619
Being with the brothers and sisters,

01:20:45.619 --> 01:20:47.619
serving in different forms of assignment,

01:20:47.619 --> 01:20:50.619
I could definitely say without one shadow of a doubt

01:20:50.619 --> 01:21:01.550
that I still would not swap it for the world.

01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:06.550
So, we've enjoyed a rich, spiritual feast so far.

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:08.550
But there's more to come.

01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:13.279
What a blessing these graduates will be

01:21:13.279 --> 01:21:16.279
to the brothers and sisters in their assignments.

01:21:16.279 --> 01:21:19.279
The second and third parts of the graduation

01:21:19.279 --> 01:21:24.279
will be available on JW.org later this month.

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:29.279
We know you're excited to see the rest of the program.

01:21:29.279 --> 01:21:31.279
To conclude this month's broadcast,

01:21:31.279 --> 01:21:34.279
let's go to Tahiti.

01:21:34.279 --> 01:21:38.279
It's the main island of French Polynesia,

01:21:38.279 --> 01:21:42.279
a territory of about 118 inhabited islands.

01:21:42.279 --> 01:21:45.279
It's a beautiful land marked by mountains,

01:21:45.279 --> 01:21:49.279
waterfalls, and white sand of tolls.

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:52.279
The surroundings team with life,

01:21:52.279 --> 01:21:55.279
man to raise glide through the water

01:21:55.279 --> 01:21:57.279
while the land produces an abundance

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:00.279
of beautiful flower species.

01:22:00.279 --> 01:22:02.279
The beauty of this island is found

01:22:02.279 --> 01:22:04.279
not only in its natural scenery,

01:22:04.279 --> 01:22:08.279
but also in the hospitable attitude of the people.

01:22:08.279 --> 01:22:11.279
Our brothers and sisters of the Bahima congregation

01:22:11.279 --> 01:22:16.279
make it a priority to share the beauty of God's Word.

01:22:16.279 --> 01:22:19.279
Their territory extends from the city center

01:22:19.279 --> 01:22:21.279
to the mountains and remote islands

01:22:21.279 --> 01:22:24.279
of Apataki and Riccatiha.

01:22:24.279 --> 01:22:27.279
They witness to the local fishermen at the beach

01:22:28.279 --> 01:22:31.279
to the international sailors at its large harbors

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:34.279
and their efforts have proven successful.

01:22:34.279 --> 01:22:39.279
Currently the congregation is conducting 107 Bible studies

01:22:39.279 --> 01:22:43.279
and, yes, 107 brothers and sisters

01:22:43.279 --> 01:22:45.279
from the Bahima congregation

01:22:45.279 --> 01:22:47.279
send their warm greetings to you

01:22:47.279 --> 01:22:50.279
wherever you are globally.

01:22:50.279 --> 01:22:53.279
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:22:53.279 --> 01:22:56.279
this is JW Broadcasting.
