00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.699
I would ask Jehovah, how am I going to be able to encourage my uncle when I myself need encouragement?

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:47.560
The doctor said, this is your lung. See this mass here? You have lung cancer.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:01:05.840
There's a feeling of helplessness when someone you rely on falls ill and they're so little you can do to help or comfort them.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:18.120
PVG stands for patient visitation group.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.120
It's a group made up of elders organized to visit our hospitalized brothers and sisters. It's a form of shepherding.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.120
We offer practical help, but the focus is on providing spiritual support.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.120
Assuring those friends that Jehovah seized them and that they had the support of both the congregation and Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:46.120
The first time I was hospitalized, I don't think I'd even been in there for 24 hours before they started visiting me, even though they didn't know me.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.120
They didn't know who this route was.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.120
When elders from the publishers own congregation participate in these PVG visits, it's invaluable.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.120
Seeing someone they know can provide a lot of comfort for that brother or sister who needs it.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.740
The first step is to listen and let that brother or sister express themselves freely.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:18.159
Then we address their spiritual need, always using the Bible to offer encouragement.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:24.159
My uncle was in need of encouragement and frankly I was too.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:30.159
Just then two men with big smiles on their faces headed our way and I thought, those are doctors.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:41.159
There are brothers and they introduced themselves as members of the PVG and we were so moved by that because it was exactly what we needed.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:50.159
My mom's condition had worsened and I had to head to the hospital. We arrived very late around 2 a.m., but still a brother from PVG was there waiting for us.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.159
All our needs were lovingly cared for, we were even provided with a place to stay.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.159
After that visit ended, I remember seeing those brothers outside the hospital on their way out.

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:06.159
Even from where I was, serving from afar, I could tell that those brothers got so much joy from their assignment.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:13.159
And not only them, their wives too, because they could have spent their day differently on a walk or relaxing.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.569
But no, they chose to be here.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.569
They asked me to read Isaiah 41-10, but I couldn't get through it. I just cried.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.569
So they read it to me and it hits differently when you hear it as Jehovah speaking to you personally.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:40.569
I never imagined at the moment that I felt the most alone and sad to have what would provide that visit for me and my uncle.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:53.569
It was as if Jehovah were saying, I am here my daughter, I am right here for you, and I sent these brothers so that they can strengthen and encourage you, so don't give up.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.569
I never imagined at the moment that I felt the most alone and sad, Jehovah would provide that visit for me and my uncle.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:23.290
May Jehovah continue to bless them and their beautiful work. What those brothers did for me made all the difference.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:31.290
I felt Jehovah's loving care through these brothers. That brotherly love was made so real to me, they motivated me to give back.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.290
It allows us to convey a small portion of the immense love Jehovah has for us.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.290
And they're always so grateful for the visit, recognizing it as one way Jehovah and his organization care for them.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:51.290
You can see it on their face and from their expressions that they consider this tender care is coming from Jehovah.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.290
It's so rewarding to be used by Jehovah in this way.
