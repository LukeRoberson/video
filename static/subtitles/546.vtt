00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.900
Jehovah is the great encourager.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.500
He's the primary giver of strength to his people.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.300
So let's use Jeremiah.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.900
Jeremiah as an example of one who Jehovah encouraged

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.500
and let's see what we can learn.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.699
Let's open our Bibles to Jeremiah chapter 1.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.300
Now Jeremiah was about 25 years old when he was commissioned to be a prophet

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.899
and he didn't feel qualified.

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.100
He said, I'm but a boy.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.300
I'm not ready for this serious responsibility.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.500
What did Jeremiah need?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.299
Jeremiah needed reassurance and he needed encouragement.

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.000
So what would Jehovah do?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.700
Well, let's find out chapter 1 and verse 8.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.100
Do not be afraid because of their appearance.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.500
For I am with you to save you declares Jehovah.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.399
I am with you, Jeremiah.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.799
What did that mean?

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.299
My Holy Spirit.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:02.600
Jehovah's Holy Spirit would give Jeremiah the needed strength and encouragement

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.799
to maintain his zeal in God's service for some 60 years

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.200
that inexhaustible spirit would encourage Jeremiah month after month and year after year.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.900
He needed encouragement.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.000
He got it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.500
Jehovah did not let him down.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.099
But in addition to Jehovah's Holy Spirit,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.200
what else did Jehovah do for Jeremiah to encourage him?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.599
Well, Jeremiah tells us, let's open up to chapter 15.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:40.659
Jeremiah chapter 15 and let's read verse 16.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.859
Jeremiah says, your words were found.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:46.459
Let's pause there.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.260
Your words were found available to Jeremiah.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:02:03.859
Were the inspired words, the inspired documents and writings of Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.460
But Jeremiah just didn't keep those inspired writings at a distance.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.960
Notice what he says, and I ate them.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:21.159
Jeremiah took the time to eat, digest, and to meditate on God's word.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.560
It was Jeremiah who compiled first and second kings.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.759
Jeremiah hit the books.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:29.759
He studied.

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:34.060
He researched the documents that were available to him.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.360
Jeremiah mentioned the history of the book, the history book of the kings 33 times.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.060
He must have drawn encouragement by examining prophecies, prophecies that he saw come true in his very day.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.960
He saw them being fulfilled.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:02.759
For example, it was Jeremiah that was inspired to record the prophecy at first kings, chapter 13 and verse 2,

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:16.659
where an unnamed man of God during the time of Jeroboam foretold a man, a person named Josiah that would act against false worship.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.759
Now, that prophecy was uttered some 300 years before Jeremiah was even born.

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:30.360
But how this must have strengthened Jeremiah to do the research and to meditate on this prophecy and to live at the time of its fulfillment,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.360
adding to Jeremiah's joy, Josiah was his good friend.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.159
So no wonder he says there in verse 16,

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:47.560
and your word became to me the exultation and the rejoicing of my heart.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.460
So look what we've learned so far.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.659
One, your words were found.

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.759
Two, I ate them.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:03.699
Three, it resulted in the rejoicing of my heart.

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.819
Let's take another example.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:17.120
Have you ever wondered what helped Jeremiah despite being persecuted to keep warning wicked kings,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.720
like Jehovah Kim and Zedakaya to serve Jehovah, where would he get that encouragement from?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.420
Well, consider this, chapter 15 and verse 4.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.360
Verse 4.

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:44.160
And I, Jehovah speaking, and I will make them, God's people, an object of heart to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.360
The son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.360
For what Manasseh did in Jerusalem.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.660
Now again, Jeremiah had done extensive research into the reigns of the kings, including Manasseh.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.560
It was Jeremiah that recorded how Manasseh set up altars to bail.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.360
He spilt in his simple blood.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.560
He had his own sons passed through the fire.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.959
He did on a grand scale, but was bad in Jehovah's eyes.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:16.160
Manasseh was wicked.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.399
And yet, Jeremiah would be aware of Manasseh's repentance.

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:28.000
Since Manasseh died when Jeremiah was about 10 years old.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.600
So it's true.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.100
Jeremiah researched Manasseh's terrible conduct, but he also researched his repentance.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:44.100
So how encouraging that must have been to Jeremiah to see the value of continuing to urge wicked kings.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.600
Like Jehovah Kim and Zedekiah to seek Jehovah's mercy, saying to himself,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:57.899
if Manasseh, who was notorious for idolatry and bloodshed, could repent and be forgiven, what about you Zedekiah?

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:05.899
Point, God's word, researching it to God's word, energized Jeremiah,

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:13.100
so that he continued to build his faith and his trust and his confidence in Jehovah during difficult times.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.399
Well, humans did fail Jeremiah. It's true.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:21.199
They didn't give him the encouragement he needed when he needed it. It's true.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.500
But Jehovah never failed Jeremiah.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.199
Jehovah helped him and isn't it the same with us?

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:33.199
At times, we expect encouragement and we might not get it at the time we expect it.

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.600
But Jehovah will always give it to us. He'll never fail us.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.600
Do you want encouragement?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.600
Then go to the source of encouragement.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:51.500
Even a few minutes each day, just a few minutes of Bible reading and meditation each day

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.100
reminds us of how our actions touched Jehovah's feelings.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:08.899
We gain encouragement by thinking about how Jehovah views us, our relationship with him.

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:11.500
Here's a suggestion.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.300
If we need help to jumpstart daily Bible reading, then try this.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.000
Start with Psalm 119.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.199
This Psalm is distinguished by being divided into 22 stanzas, eight verses each.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:35.000
It takes about one minute to read these eight verses.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.699
And fall in love with those verses. This is Jehovah speaking to us.

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:45.199
But then choose one verse out of the eight.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:52.600
Just one. A verse that you want to lock on to, you want to sink down deep.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.899
And think about that one verse and ask yourself some questions.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:08:00.600
Perhaps it's verse 11 of Psalm 119.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:07.600
In my heart, I have treasured up your sayings that I may not sin against you.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.800
And now, stir your feelings.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.899
Stir your heart with a few questions.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.800
How many scriptures have I treasured up in my heart that I may not sin against Jehovah?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.500
Can I list two or three on a piece of paper if I had to do so?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.699
Scriptures that are conduct altering.

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:32.200
Scriptures that really do help me in time of temptation or trial.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.500
Now, that only took a few minutes to do, maybe five minutes,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.000
but the value is deep, a lot of value for a little time.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.700
And then if you have more time, tap on that research guide.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:51.100
And it explodes with more information that can help us in our meditations and love for Jehovah God.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.500
Now, it doesn't take long, but it's consistent.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.600
We form a longing for God's word.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:06.399
In less than two months, we have eaten and digested some 176 precious thoughts of Jehovah God.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:08.899
Jehovah is the source of encouragement.

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:13.299
And he's the great encourager, and he wants to encourage us.

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:19.500
But like Jeremiah, we need to eat, digest, and think deeply on the encouragement that

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:29.000
Jehovah does give us through his inspired word, and the result will be the exultation and rejoicing of our hearts.
