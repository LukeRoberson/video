00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.689
When will Jesus separate the sheep from the goats?

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:16.350
When were true Christians held captive by Babylon the Great?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.350
There have been so many interesting developments in our understanding that I have deeply appreciated.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.530
However, some adjustments were a challenge for me.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.530
I was baptized in 1960 when I was 12 years old.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.530
I enjoyed the circuit and district work for 41 years.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.509
In 1971, I was serving as the congregation's servant.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:56.509
The divine name district assembly shined new light of truth.

00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:03.509
Before then, congregations had just one overseer, the congregation's servant.

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:09.510
But that assembly highlighted it just as Philippians won one shows.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.969
The first century Christian congregations had more than one elder.

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:23.969
One day, there was a letter in my mailbox. It was from the branch.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.969
The letter said that the arrangement for a body of elders would start.

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:41.469
So to prepare the congregation committee and exemplar brothers had to meet and recommend those they believe could serve as elders.

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.469
We prayerfully discussed a matter.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:53.390
And all of us were recommended as ministerial servants.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.390
Until then, I had given public talks and other congregations and that circuit assemblies.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.390
Now, I would not be given such assignments.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.389
Many elders from other congregations would come up to me and ask,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.389
Brother Ishibashi, can you come and give a talk at our congregation?

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.389
Oh, sorry, I can't. I'm not an elder.

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:30.439
What? Everyone looked genuinely surprised that really tested my humility and at times, I felt quite depressed.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.439
As proverb score 18 says,

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.439
The path of the righteous is like the bright morning light.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:49.439
With each flash of light, I needed to adjust to Jehovah's way of thinking and way of handling things and keep moving ahead.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:58.439
I prayerfully shifted gears. I had many things to do, so I devoted myself to the field service and to congregation activities.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.439
And I rejoiced over the congregation's growth.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.439
Having a body of elders helped many brothers.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:12.439
It helped them reach out and attain the scriptural qualifications to be an elder.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:18.439
Better arrangement helps decisions to be made in better harmony with Jehovah's will.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.439
Those are great changes.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.439
A few months later, I received another letter from the branch.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.439
It said that I was to serve as an elder in a different congregation.

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:38.139
When I receive new publications or a new watchtower magazine,

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:46.139
I always study them carefully to see if there are any new understandings or topics to study further.

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:52.139
I also look up the beliefs clarified section in the publications index,

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.139
and I make it a topic of personal study.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.139
This research has really benefited me.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:10.659
Jehovah is the God of love.

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:20.660
By clarifying our beliefs, he has adjusted our organization to be more holy and more effective in carrying out his will.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.660
God's people are just getting better and better.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.660
We are always at new heights.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.660
It is so different from how the world is.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:42.660
I want to keep moving forward with Jehovah whenever he shows us his will as he guides us into the paradise to come.
