00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:07.830
Genesis 2, 24, says of a man and a woman who marry that they are to become one flesh.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.230
Now that raises some questions. Whose words are those? What do they mean?

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.230
How can we show that we believe them? And is there a good example in the Bible of a couple who did?

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.829
Let's start with looking at the context. If you'd open your Bibles, please do Genesis chapter 2.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.629
And we'll start with verse 18, Genesis 2.

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:36.630
The reports that Jehovah God said it is not good for the man to continue to be alone.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.429
I'm going to make a helper for him as a compliment of him, continuing in verse 21.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.829
So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.329
And while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.329
And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and he brought her to the man.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.030
Then the man said, quote, this is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.230
This one will be called woman because for man she was taken, unquote.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:18.030
That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife and they will become one flesh.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.030
So our first question is whose words are these?

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.530
Atoms?

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.530
No, the only words attributed to Adam are when he waxed poetic in verse 23.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.530
And you can see that from the opening and closing quotation marks in that verse.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.530
Well, then it must have been Moses words because after all he wrote the Bible book of Genesis.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.030
No, he was not present at the time of the first marriage.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.030
He did not start writing until some 2500 years later.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
And even then he was writing what he was inspired to write.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.030
Three Bible writers use this expression one flesh, Matthew, Mark, and Paul.

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.930
And it's Matthew who gives us the clue as to whose words they are.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:11.719
So let's turn to Matthew chapter 19, Matthew 19, beginning with verse four.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.219
And here Matthew writes and quotes Jesus.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:37.719
It says in reply, he Jesus said, have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said, quote, for this reason, a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife and the two will be one flesh, unquote.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.919
So that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:45.020
Therefore, what God has joked together, let no man put apart.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:55.819
So Matthew makes a clear Jehovah said those words and shouldn't that elevate and everyone's mind the sanctity of the marital union.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.919
As Jesus said, God created male and female to complimentary genders and he joked them together in marriage as one flesh.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.520
Now it's interesting what the Bible exposition commentary says about this.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.919
God established marriage and therefore only God can control its character.

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.620
It is a union between one man and one woman.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:31.819
God did not create two men and one woman, two women and one man, two men or two women group marriages, gay marriages and other variations are contrary to the will of God.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.620
No matter what some psychologists and jurists may say, no court of law can change what God has established.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.419
And those are comments we can agree with.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.919
Our second question is, what do these words mean? They will become one flesh.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:04:01.719
Well, of course, the one flesh relationship certainly involves sexual union, but it goes beyond that because it includes a husband and wife who have achieved mental, emotional and spiritual harmony.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.419
They are to have a oneness in their purpose and desires.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:14.419
As Bible translator William Barclay renders it at Matthew 19, five, the husband will be joined inseparably to his wife.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:21.220
So in marriage, a man and a woman are to become each other's closest partner in life.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:31.019
Being one flesh means that they must always be thinking more of each other than of themselves, that they must consider each other in everything they do.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.220
So when single people marry, they need to shift their thinking from mine to ours, from me to we.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.620
And so they must stop being single at heart and come to be married at heart, not just on paper.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.819
Our third question is, how can we show that we believe these words?

00:04:50.620 --> 00:05:00.420
Well, sad to say many people these days take a very casual attitude toward marriage and when the relationship becomes strange, they just give up and walk out on their mate.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.620
But that is not the Christian way. Marriage is to be a life-long relationship.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:14.620
Just a few verses later on in Matthew 19, verse 9, Jesus taught that the only scriptural ground for dissolving marriage is one in innocent mate,

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.920
chooses not to forgive an adulterous partner.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:26.420
And that is because sexual relations outside the marriage bond are a gross perversion of the one flesh union.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:35.620
Now let's read Paul's words about this at 1 Corinthians chapter 6, 1 Corinthians 6, and verse 16.

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:43.939
He said, do you not know that anyone who is joined to a prostitute is one body with her?

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.839
For the two says he will be one flesh.

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:55.240
So the adulterer pulls away from his marriage mate and makes himself one flesh with a third person.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.139
That then is the only scriptural basis for divorce.

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:06.040
But divorce is a very painful experience as one sociologist put it divorces drastic surgery.

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.040
To sever the one flesh bond between husband and wife would be like sawing oneself a sunder.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:21.639
What though if no adultery has been committed, but for some reason, two people who are married to each other just don't like each other any longer.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.839
Divorce is not an option.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:38.540
Instead, they need to remind themselves of what attracted them to each other and work at rekindling those feelings while at the same time looking to Jehovah for help and not only strengthening their marriage, but also their spirituality.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:48.139
Our fourth question is what scriptural example is there of a married couple who believe this one flesh idea?

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:51.939
Turn to Romans chapter 16 and verse three, please.

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:53.540
Romans 16, three.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:03.540
Here Paul writes, give my greetings to Priska or Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:13.540
So yes, Aquila and Priscilla, what a model of a close and united couple living up to what Jehovah meant when he said that a husband or wife should become one flesh.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:22.040
And Paul who worked closely with them could not think of that dear brother without recalling the faithful cooperation of his wife.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.040
So it's a fine example for Christian couples today.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:37.939
And in every one of the six references to this couple in the Christian Greek scriptures, we find them working together, cooperating without competition or strife and never is one mentioned without the other.

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:43.339
They constantly work together in their home and their secular work in the ministry.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:53.439
And surely it was a time spent together in Christian activities that kept their marriage on a high spiritual plane working side by side to further the kingdom work.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:08:00.139
Now you and your marriage may be a part for much of the day due to different work and responsibilities.

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:13.540
But can you find time each day to eat meals together to do household chores together to take walks together to be together to get caught up on what has gone on in your lives during the day.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:24.839
Aquila and Priscilla prove that being united in activities related to true worship can keep a couple's thinking and goals aligned and that does strengthen a marriage.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:35.539
For example, studying together, participating in congregation meetings together, sharing in the ministry together, praying together, in doing all of that.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:51.940
A person's interests, priorities and habits will harmonize with those of one spouse until like Aquila and Priscilla, we increasingly think, feel and act as one flesh.

00:08:52.639 --> 00:09:01.139
So now we know who said the words, it was Jehovah, we understand what they mean, achieving harmony in one's relationship with one's mate.

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:14.440
And we can certainly prove that we believe these words by staying close to our mate and maintaining our marriage bond and then we have that excellent example of Aquila and Priscilla to abide by.
