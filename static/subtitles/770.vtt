WEBVTT

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.740
To whom do we belong?

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.220
When was the last time you said to yourself,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.740
I belong to Jehovah.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.179
Maybe it was during the singing of song number 40

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.179
that we just concluded.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.579
It's important for all of us really

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.379
to think about our dedication vow.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:21.899
Why?

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.620
Because it helps us to focus on what's really important,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.179
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.940
During this talk, we're going to discuss why

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.539
belonging to Jehovah is the most secure place to be.

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.340
But we want to start off by discussing

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.060
how we also belong to the Christian congregation.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.700
And really, in what sense is that the case?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.579
Well, I invite you to open to 1 Corinthians chapter three.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.659
And first, a little bit of context.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.100
Beginning in chapter one, the Apostle Paul reveals

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.780
that the congregation in Corinth was divided.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.700
There were divisions in the congregation.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.899
Some Christians were expressing favoritism.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.420
Some said, I belong to Paul.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.140
Others, I belong to Apollo.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.340
Others, I belong to Cephas or Peter.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.620
Why?

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.569
Well, those men had remarkable qualities and abilities.

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:23.530
But should they have focused on them so much?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.170
They had remarkable abilities in teaching or in shepherding.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.329
Maybe the brothers in Corinth were heard saying,

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.090
Apollo, this is my favorite speaker.

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:33.450
Or Paul is my favorite missionary.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450
Or Peter is my favorite shepherd.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.170
He's so down to earth.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.849
What was Paul's inspired council?

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:45.689
We find it in verses 21 through 23.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.329
1 Corinthians chapter three, verses 21 through 23.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.849
He says, so that no one boasts in men

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.890
for all things belong to you.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.969
Whether Paul or Apollo's or Cephas or the world or life

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.689
or death or things now here or things to come,

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.969
all things belong to you.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.569
In turn, you belong to Christ.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.449
Christ in turn belongs to God.

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:16.490
Let no one boasts in men.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.409
What's the point?

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.330
The Christians in Corinth really had no basis

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.849
to say that they belong to Paul or Apollo's or to Peter.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.090
Instead, it was the other way around.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.569
That was the reality.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.810
All things belong to you.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.689
All things belong to the congregation.

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.689
The Christian congregation.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.250
That is, all things God has made or arranged

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.849
are at the disposal of Christians for their benefit.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.689
Paul, Apollo's and Cephas, we're all working

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.090
unitedly to build up the Christian congregation.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.889
They all belong to the congregation

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:54.810
as a gift from God to help the congregation

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.250
for the congregation's well-being.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.330
Well, where do we fit in these verses?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.409
Where do you fit as Gilead soon to be graduates?

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.969
How will that help you in your new assignments?

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.490
Well, we too are part of the collective Christian congregation

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.810
to which all things belong.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.729
And that's a comforting thought.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:17.569
What does that mean?

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.530
Well, circuit overseers, field missionaries,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.289
congregation elders, Bethelites are a gift from Jehovah

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:31.240
for our encouragement for the benefit of the congregation.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.879
But we can turn that around as well.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:34.840
The opposite is true.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.639
Just like Paul, Apollo's and Cephas,

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.560
we too as our individuals belonging to the congregation,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.680
we are gifts from God for their well-being.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.199
What does that mean?

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.280
Well, simply put, at times we receive encouragement,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.599
at times we give encouragement to others in the congregation.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.840
The Apostle Peter later wrote in 1 Peter 4 verse 10

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.719
to the extent that each one has received a gift,

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.919
use it in ministering.

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.080
Now, the Greek word rendered ministering literally means serving.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.560
So ministering to one another, serving one another

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.120
as fine stewards of God's undeserved kindness,

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.639
that is expressed in various ways.

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.220
So each of you has a gift.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.860
Each of you is a gift to the congregation.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.139
So continue to let Jehovah use you to help others.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.699
We can be expressions of Jehovah's loving kindness,

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.779
undeserved kindness to fellow believers,

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:41.459
but only if we act in their behalf.

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:44.259
Now, there's something else that Paul mentioned in this verse.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.500
He said, in turn, you belong to Christ.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.100
Christ is head of the Christian congregation.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.740
So the congregation is like a body,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.259
and the head controls the movement of the body.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.939
The head directs all the parts of the body,

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.540
how to move, how to perform work.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.379
So do we personally choose our assignments,

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.459
where we serve?

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.540
Granted, we might pursue particular goals

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.939
or avenues of service, but do we

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.250
choose our assignment and Bethel service?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.050
When I first came to Bethel, I had the idea

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.290
that I wanted to work in construction or in the art department.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.689
I was assigned to the binary.

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.490
If we view each assignment as coming from Jehovah

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.290
from Jesus Christ as the head,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.769
it will help us to be content and happy.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.250
What about a new circuit over here?

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.610
Does he get to choose where he wants to serve?

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.089
What about a newly appointed field missionary?

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:49.930
Does he select the country or the city where he will serve?

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.490
You know the answer to that.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.170
We might compare to air traffic control

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.170
at a major airport.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.209
Jesus directs us through the organization

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:05.769
to when to take off and where and when to land.

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:10.319
Jesus might also tell us you're grounded.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.759
Maybe we're not ready for flight.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:12.920
Maybe we need to refuel.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.600
Maybe it's time to retire the plane.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.519
But Jesus is in control.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:23.680
In New York, New Jersey, nearly 1,200 flights

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.199
passed through the airport every day.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.839
Total of 36,387 in August 2023.

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.920
That requires tremendous organization and coordination.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.959
They have to work around rainstorms, snowstorms,

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:42.240
windstorms, not just at the local airport,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.759
but in other places throughout the country, too.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.360
Well, what would happen if there was no air traffic control?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:58.319
Collisions damaged to aircraft life might be lost?

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.199
Complete chaos.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.519
There certainly would be problems.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:03.879
What about the Christian congregation?

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:06.800
Well, Jesus is the perfect leader and commander.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.160
And we do our best to follow his direction.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.759
Think about the tremendous amount of work

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.560
and organization involved in training

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.439
and appointing branch committee members.

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.439
Circuit overseers, congregation elders, ministerial servants,

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:21.759
regular pioneers, not to mention the organization

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.560
of theocratic schools as well.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.639
Gilead, the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.560
School for Congregation Elders, Pioneer Service Schools,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:37.279
many others that requires organization and coordination.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:42.800
What we might call a tremendous air traffic control.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.079
Aren't we glad that we belong to an organization with Christ

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.839
as the head?

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:51.959
But at times it calls for personal sacrifices.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:54.319
The pilot can't tell air traffic control

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.720
when and where he wants to land.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.680
It requires personal sacrifices on his part.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.120
The August 1st, 1998 watchtower contained

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.319
this life story of brother George Couch, a name familiar to us.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.600
While serving in the circuit work in 1957,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.160
brother Couch and his wife were invited

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.079
to serve at Bethel instead.

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:17.319
And brother Couch received some very pointed counsel

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:20.720
from brother Nore, his first day at Bethel.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.560
What did brother Nore tell him?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.839
He said, you're not a circuit servant anymore.

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:27.279
You were here to work at Bethel.

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:29.600
This is the most important work that you have to do

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.519
and we want you to put your time and energy

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:35.159
into applying the training you receive here at Bethel.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.000
Brother Couch related the first assignment

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.039
I had was in the magazine and mailing departments.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.399
Later, after about three years, brother Nore

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.879
informed me that the real reason I was brought to Bethel

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:49.200
was to work in the home.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.240
You are here to run the Bethel home, he said.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.720
While during those first three years,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.240
brother Couch must have wondered why in the world

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.879
he was taken out of the circuit work

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:04.600
to work in the magazine and mailing department.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:12.899
But Jesus knew why, brother Nore knew why,

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:16.899
and looking back on that, we know why too.

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:19.220
Brother Couch was dearly loved as the Bethel home

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.340
overseer for many decades.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.659
Incidentally, the title he chose for his life story

00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:27.700
is we have done what we ought to have done,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.899
a sterling example for all of us.

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:33.500
So what have we learned to this point?

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.340
All things belong to you, all things belong to the congregation.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.539
We are servants to our brothers and sisters.

00:09:39.539 --> 00:09:43.899
We care for one another as belonging to the same body.

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:46.860
The Apostle Paul expressed that well at Romans 12 verse 5.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.740
We are members belonging to one another.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.419
And you as a Gilead class have already demonstrated that.

00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:57.259
You've rallied around one another.

00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:58.940
You've rallied around Bethelites

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.899
who have gone through difficult trials in their life.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:05.379
And we also learned that you belong to Christ,

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:06.740
the head of the Christian congregation,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.500
Christ Jesus determines how, when and where we might serve best.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.700
So yes, we belong to the congregation.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.460
And we can be confident that in any future assignments

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.860
that we receive, there will be brothers and sisters there

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.740
that we can share, that with, we can encourage, we can strengthen.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.419
We will find joy in ministering to others

00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:33.340
just as Paul, Apollo's, and Peter found joy

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.700
in serving their Christian brothers as well.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.779
Let's consider our second point now, though.

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:43.759
We belong to Jehovah.

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:47.200
Do you remember the day of your baptism?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.879
Do you remember the smell of the water?

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:51.759
If it was in an assembly hall, maybe chlorine.

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:56.039
If you were baptized in the sea, maybe there was a salt smell.

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:59.960
Maybe the temperature of the water was what struck you the most.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.440
What about the baptism talk?

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.639
Or the baptism questions?

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:08.399
Well, every year we're reminded of the questions three times, right?

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:12.809
Two assemblies and one convention.

00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:15.570
Have you repented of your sins?

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.289
Dedicated yourself to Jehovah

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:22.289
and accepted his way of salvation through Jesus Christ?

00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:25.610
And second, do you understand that your baptism identifies you

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:31.730
as one of Jehovah's witnesses in association with his organization?

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.330
Well, before hundreds, perhaps thousands of people,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.330
of course, the most important witnesses being in the heavens,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.850
we answered yes to those questions.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:43.970
And then we were baptized.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:48.570
And how we made Jehovah's heart rejoice on that day.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.690
But dedication is a personal choice.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.450
Our parents can't make that decision for us.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.570
Our Bible teacher can't make that decision for us.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:58.210
Dedication to Jehovah is personal.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.169
And why do we dedicate our life to Jehovah?

00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:02.570
Because we love him.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.129
We love his organization.

00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:08.850
Because we learned about his beautiful personality.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.450
And during Gilead, you've learned many more reasons to love Jehovah

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.690
and his organization.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.090
So how do we now feel about our God?

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:24.419
Perhaps as described in Isaiah chapter 44,

00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:27.299
Isaiah 44, notice with me verse five,

00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:32.299
and see if this reflects your feelings towards Jehovah.

00:12:32.299 --> 00:12:34.340
Isaiah 44, five, one will say,

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.899
I belong to Jehovah.

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:40.019
Another will call himself by the name of Jacob.

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:41.700
And yet another will write on his hand,

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.539
belonging to Jehovah.

00:12:44.539 --> 00:12:48.019
And he will adopt the name of Israel.

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:49.620
Belonging to Jehovah.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.460
Written in permanent ink, we can't tell Jehovah

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.340
that our dedication was a mistake, no.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.620
We've attached ourselves to the Almighty God.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.379
What a privilege that is to belong to the only true God.

00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:07.259
We're proud to bear his name, Jehovah.

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:11.340
And at times like this, we might echo the words of Joshua.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:18.139
As for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah.

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:21.019
Well, the question is, how does that make Jehovah feel

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:25.820
about you, that determination to continue serving him?

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:32.419
If you're still there in Isaiah, notice chapter 43, verse one.

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:35.059
Now, this is what Jehovah says, your creator, O Jacob,

00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:37.620
the one who formed you, O Israel, do not be afraid

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.940
for I have repurchased you.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.539
I have called you by your name.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.179
You belong to me.

00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:48.019
You belong to me.

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:49.899
Of course, Jehovah here is speaking about his people

00:13:49.899 --> 00:13:53.179
as a whole, but he knows us individually.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.419
Second Timothy 2, verse 19, tells us directly,

00:13:56.419 --> 00:14:00.379
Jehovah knows those who belong to him.

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:03.379
He has a personal attachment to each of us.

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:05.539
That's how Jehovah feels about all

00:14:05.539 --> 00:14:07.379
of his precious servants.

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:11.889
That's how Jehovah feels about you.

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:13.889
Well, does dedication to Jehovah mean

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:17.960
that life is without trials?

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.799
What do you think?

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:20.639
No?

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:24.159
We've all experienced trials,

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:28.159
but what assurance can we have during those trials?

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:31.960
Right there in Isaiah chapter 43, notice verse two,

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.320
Jehovah's personal assurance.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.879
It says, when you pass through the waters,

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:40.639
I will be with you, and through the rivers,

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.919
they will not flood over you.

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:45.320
When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.759
nor will the flame cinch you.

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:52.600
I wonder if Han and I, Michelle and Aziraya

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.320
had those words in mind as the King Nebuchadnezzar

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.649
condemned them to the fiery furnace.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:01.649
But what's the point?

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.490
Jehovah doesn't promise to remove trials,

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:10.490
but he says, I will be with you in the flood, in the fire.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.730
Jehovah can quiet our fears so that we can endure them,

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.210
so that we can maintain our integrity to him,

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.769
even in the face of death.

00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:22.529
Well, how does that play out in real life?

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:26.049
Let's consider one of Jehovah's precious servants

00:15:26.049 --> 00:15:27.090
in our modern day history.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.169
Sister Valentina Garnofskaia.

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:32.529
Now, she was one of many witnesses in Russia

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:36.409
who kept her integrity despite severe trials.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.769
In 1945, when she was about 20 years old,

00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:41.169
her brother witnessed to her,

00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:46.850
and he made two return visits, but then she never saw him again.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.409
Well, what did she do with her limited knowledge of the truth?

00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:52.570
She started preaching.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.889
She began to preach to her neighbors,

00:15:53.889 --> 00:15:56.450
and as a result, she was arrested and sentenced

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.940
to eight years in the labor camp.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.419
In 1953, she was released and right away

00:16:04.419 --> 00:16:05.940
resumed her preaching work.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.019
Again, she was arrested and imprisoned this time for 10 years.

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:13.340
Now, the picture shows Valentina with a group of sisters

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:18.340
in a labor camp during her second imprisonment around 1959.

00:16:20.169 --> 00:16:22.210
Well, what happened next?

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.970
1967, Valentina was again set free,

00:16:26.169 --> 00:16:28.769
and she was finally able to symbolize her dedication

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:30.889
to Jehovah by water baptism.

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:34.059
Incredible.

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:37.539
All of that, preaching, being imprisoned,

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:41.419
despite actually having been baptized.

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:42.580
But that's not the end of the story.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.539
In 1969, she was again arrested.

00:16:44.539 --> 00:16:47.940
This time, she was sentenced to three years in prison.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.419
Still, she kept on preaching.

00:16:49.419 --> 00:16:51.860
Before she died in 2001,

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.980
she helped 44 people to learn the truth.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.620
She had spent 21 years in prisons and camps.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.179
And at the end of her life, Valentina said,

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:01.899
I never had my own place to live.

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:04.500
All my possessions were in a single suitcase,

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:08.619
but I was happy and content in serving Jehovah.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.700
What's the lesson?

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.660
Jehovah knows those who belong to him,

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.019
and he cares for them, even in the flood or in the fire.

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:21.700
In recent years, the fire of persecution

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.259
has started to grow again in Russia.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.700
Here's a collage of nearly 700 of our brothers

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.900
and sisters in Russia who've been persecuted

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.519
for belonging to Jehovah.

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:39.119
One of the sisters in the collage named Ludmila

00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:43.990
is currently in prison, and what was her so-called crime?

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.269
According to the court document,

00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:52.359
describing the attractiveness of serving Jehovah.

00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:57.089
Shame on the authorities for persecuting our dear sister.

00:17:57.089 --> 00:17:59.369
These dear ones are precious to Jehovah.

00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:02.049
He is watching over them, even if they're currently in prison.

00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:04.210
Through his word, Jehovah says that in them personally,

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:09.210
you belong to me, I will be with you.

00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:14.400
For these dear ones and all of us who belong to Jehovah,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.759
we find a very interesting verse later in Isaiah chapter 43,

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:20.759
verse 13.

00:18:20.759 --> 00:18:23.480
It says, also, I am always the same one.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.480
And no one can snatch anything out of my hand

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.440
when I act who can prevent it.

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:32.880
So when I act who can prevent it, Jehovah says,

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.799
no one can snatch anything out of my hand.

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:37.519
Now, previously the New World translation said here,

00:18:37.519 --> 00:18:41.839
there was no one affecting deliverance out of my hand.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.200
In other words, when Jehovah acts against his enemies,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.119
as he did against ancient Babylon as we know it in verse 14,

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:52.599
no one can turn back his hand.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:57.200
But the current rendering, no one can snatch anything out

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.440
of my hand made me think of Jesus' words in John chapter 10.

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:05.680
John 10 verse 29, Jesus said, no one can snatch them

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.829
or Jesus precious sheep out of the hand of the Father.

00:19:11.829 --> 00:19:14.750
That's a secure place to be in Jehovah's hand.

00:19:16.269 --> 00:19:18.869
How might we illustrate this?

00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:21.430
Well, let's use an example from Jehovah's creative works,

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:25.109
a grizzly bear, a mother grizzly bear.

00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:29.630
She's super protective of her cubs.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.630
Will she care for them?

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.390
Or I'll just try to get between her and her cubs

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.910
and you'll find out real fast.

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:37.750
One reference says, mother bears are affectionate,

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.829
protective, devoted, strict, sensitive,

00:19:40.829 --> 00:19:43.309
and attentive with their young.

00:19:43.309 --> 00:19:46.589
Bears can be empathetic, fearful, joyful, playful,

00:19:46.589 --> 00:19:48.750
social, and altruistic.

00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:51.470
Well, what about Jehovah?

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.069
If a mother bear is protective and devoted,

00:19:56.069 --> 00:20:01.069
how much more so is Jehovah interested in each one of you,

00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:03.990
each one of all of us, our brothers and sisters

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:08.759
in Russia included.

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:11.799
If we live or if we die, we belong to Jehovah.

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:14.319
That's a secure place to be.

00:20:14.319 --> 00:20:15.680
Never would we want to do anything

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.680
to hurt our loving Father and take ourselves out

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.599
of Jehovah's hand.

00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:23.720
Rather, may we continue to live up to our dedication to him.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.759
So what have we considered?

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:29.640
To whom do we belong?

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.519
We belong to the Christian congregation,

00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:34.759
a beautiful international brotherhood of fathers,

00:20:34.759 --> 00:20:39.200
mothers and sons, mothers, sisters, daughters,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.319
brothers as well, all belonging to one another.

00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:44.759
We belong to Christ, the head of the Christian congregation

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:47.720
who provides direction in our service to Jehovah.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.839
Tells us when to take off where to land.

00:20:50.839 --> 00:20:52.519
We belong to Jehovah, our God,

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:56.720
the benevolent Father of a loving universal family.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.519
So may we always treasure our precious place

00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:01.759
among Jehovah's people.

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:03.640
And as you go to your assignments,

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.200
please be assured of our continued love and support.
