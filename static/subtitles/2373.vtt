00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:16.359
Every spring, the eastern monarch butterfly begins a migration that rivals that of some birds and whales.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:22.789
How does such a delicate insect make such a long trip?

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:32.579
Monarchs are strong, efficient flyers, thanks to their wingshape and the way they flap them.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.299
They may also glide on air currents for an extra boost.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:50.570
In spring, millions of monarch butterflies leave Central Mexico.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:59.219
They fly northeast for several hundred miles, where they reach the end of their lifespan.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.219
Amazingly, the end of their life doesn't mean the end of the journey.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:13.180
Before they die, they lay eggs.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:21.180
The next generation hatches, matures, and keeps flying north, again and again.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:34.180
Until up to four generations later, when the great and great, great grandchildren of the original monarchs occupy their summer home, mostly throughout the northeastern United States.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:43.180
They perform this multi-generational relay with no training, no map, and a brain no larger than the head of a pin.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.180
Amazingly, one thing they do have is a solar compass.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:01.840
It tells them what direction to fly relative to the sun, even when it's behind clouds.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.819
A clock in their antennae adjusts their heading as the sun moves across the sky.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:17.819
Monarchs also have an annual clock that tells them when to begin their journey back to Mexico, before the weather turns too cold.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.819
But the trip home is not so easy.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:34.819
They'll need more than efficient flying and good navigation to succeed, because this generation will fly the entire journey back, stretching over almost 3,000 miles.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.819
The monarchs prepare for their journey in an unexpected way.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.819
They stop producing eggs temporarily and instead build muscle and store fat.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.819
They grow larger, can fly almost 10 times as far and live up to 8 times as long.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.819
They're a butterfly, super-generation.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.819
Their compass heading flips from north to south, and off they go.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.819
In about two months, they arrive back to their point of origin in Mexico.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.819
They place neither they nor their parents, grandparents, nor perhaps even their great-grandparents have ever seen.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:25.819
Researchers hope that a better understanding of the monarch butterfly will help create efficient, long-range micro-air vehicles.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.819
What do you think?

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.819
Did the monarch butterflies ability to migrate long distances evolve or was it designed?
