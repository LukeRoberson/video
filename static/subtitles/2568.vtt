00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.380
My name is Donald, I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:19.410
As I was growing up, you know, I gravitated toward the streets, started using marijuana.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:29.980
Got into a lot of trouble in school, and it just snowballed.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.859
I wanted to know God, but I was just too preoccupied with running the streets and getting

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.539
high.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:37.539
I was messed up.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.369
I got strung out, it was in the street, light up in jail, and that's when I got my witness

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:48.829
in prison.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:57.259
It was a slow process, as I was getting to know Jehovah, and I was making the changes.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:02.859
A lot of us going in with depressed, because of the situation, we're looking for some hope,

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.180
coming in here with 25 years, 15 years, you know, when you're thinking your life is over,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.019
your life not over, you know, Jehovah could do a lot with you, Jehovah, you know, your

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:24.140
whole perspective can change.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:36.019
I knew if I applied what I learned, Jehovah would not let me down.

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:39.540
I made a lot of decisions based on what I was learning and what I wanted to do for the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.500
future, because I knew God could help me get my life back.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.780
When I finally made my first meeting, I'm sitting in the congregation, I go straight

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.780
to the front, I'm in Jehovah's house, I'm all right.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.120
I was determined that I was going to keep studying.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.719
And I have people's respect, and you know, the congregation looks up to me, and I always

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:24.139
attribute that to Jehovah, I never had this, you know, I was just a bum on the street.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:34.129
From my very first meeting, it felt like my congregation was my family.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.650
My study has helped me to be a better husband, and I respect my wife, and I love my wife,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:56.939
and I'm going to be loyal and faithful to my wife.

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:03.060
I spent seven and a half years of my life in prison, and it was like I thought my life

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.889
was worthless.

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:14.939
But yeah, it's not a day I don't go thank Jehovah for taking me out of the darkness.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:29.330
You know, he wants to take care of us, and he don't care what the situation is, he can

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.129
take us up out of any situation if we just want him to do it his way.
