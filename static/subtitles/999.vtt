WEBVTT

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:22.219
Our convention program contains over 100 audio and video productions, including the one we just enjoyed.

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:27.219
These videos are made at various locations around the world.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:33.219
We have the privilege of supporting this and other aspects of the Kingdom work.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:41.219
For your convenience, donations can be made online at donate.jw.org.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:51.659
As we saw, the Prophet Daniel maintained his faith despite tests and infirmities.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.659
How can we do the same?

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.659
What strength can we gain from the prophetic visions given to Daniel?

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.659
Please pay close attention to Brother Stephen let of the governing body.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.659
As he answers those questions in the final talk of his convention, entitled,

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.659
Become powerful by your faith.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:26.950
A building constructed with steel reinforced concrete can withstand powerful earthquakes.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.950
A tree with strong, deep roots can remain standing in the face of many powerful storms.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.950
An athlete made powerful by rigorous training can successfully complete a decathlon,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.950
a ten-event athletic contest.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.950
Well, just as a building, a tree, and an athlete can be powerful,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.950
we as Jehovah's people can be powerful by means of our faith.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.950
And we will discuss during this talk how faith, a product of Holy Spirit,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.949
the most powerful force in the universe can reinforce, fortify us for any,

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:20.949
and I mean any test trial or temptation that comes our way.

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:26.949
Now, even though we may not feel powerful physically or emotionally,

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:35.949
our faith can make us powerful spiritually, and spiritual power is much more valuable than physical

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.949
emotional power.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:42.949
With spiritual power, we can be like Abraham.

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:50.949
Please go to Romans chapter 4, and notice what was said about Abraham beginning in verse number 18.

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:59.949
Although beyond hope, yet based on hope, he had faith that he would become the father of many nations

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:04.949
according to what had been said, so your offspring will be.

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:09.949
And although he did not grow weak in faith, he considered his own body.

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:17.949
Now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, as well as the deadness of the womb of Sarah.

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:23.949
But because of the promise of God, he did not waver in a lack of faith.

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:33.949
But he noticed became powerful by his faith, giving God glory and being fully convinced

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:40.949
that what he Jehovah had promised, he Jehovah was also able to do.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:48.949
Even though almost one hundred years old, and likely Abraham would have been frail physically

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.949
and emotionally weak at times, his faith made him powerful.

00:03:53.949 --> 00:04:02.949
In fact, his faith made him so powerful that he believed this extraordinary promise with all his heart

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:09.949
that his almost ninety-year-old wife Sarah would give birth to a son, and they would definitely come true.

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:18.949
And even though that promise was unbelievable from a human standpoint, he had no doubt whatsoever.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:26.949
Well likewise, if our faith makes us powerful, we will fully believe all of Jehovah's promises

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.949
no matter how extraordinary they may seem.

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.949
We will do so without doubting whatsoever.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.949
But now think about this comparison to Abraham.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.949
An older frail, chronically ill servant of Jehovah, may seem weak.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.949
But outward appearance can be very deceptive.

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:58.949
If that one has been empowered by faith, then he is truly strong just like Abraham.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:07.949
And this wonderful convention was designed to fortify our faith so that it will empower us to be so strong,

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:14.949
we will be able to endure whatever test, trial, temptation comes against us.

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.949
And there will actually be no breaking point to our integrity.

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:30.949
But now let's talk about how each day of our convention and our outstanding drama have strengthened our faith.

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.949
First, let's talk about Friday.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:40.949
The day's theme was a quote from Luke 17.5, give us more faith.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:47.949
Now these were the humble words of Jesus Apostles who recognized their need for more faith,

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.949
and they were humbly pleading for such.

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.949
Well, we feel the same way, don't we?

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:58.949
We know we need more faith, and we humbly ask Jehovah for it.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:04.949
But now the question is, will Jehovah answer our pleas for more faith?

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:14.949
Yes he will. And Friday reveal some of the ways Jehovah answers our humble plea for more faith.

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:26.949
As illuminated on Friday, Jehovah gives us faith primarily by means of two books, the Bible and the Book of Creation.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:33.949
The first symposium showed how the Bible builds faith in God's existence.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.949
It builds faith in itself, that is the word of God.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:44.949
It builds faith in God's moral standards, and it builds faith in God's love for us.

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.949
But now we ask that first part, how does the Bible build faith in God's existence?

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:59.949
Well for one thing, within his pages, it gives us common sense reasoning scriptures, such as Hebrews 3.4.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:10.949
And you know what that says? It says, of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God.

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:19.949
Now you could never convince any sane person that a beautiful house designed and built itself.

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:37.949
Even more so, it should not be possible to convince any rational person that all the beautiful creations around us just designed and built themselves, or that they're the product of blind chance.

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:45.949
Where there is design, there is always a designer. Now let's illustrate this.

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:58.949
How many times would you have to throw black paint from a can into a white ceiling until you produced a perfect map of New York City?

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:10.949
Until the paint particles scattered accurately, identifying all of the streets, the highways, the tunnels, the bridges, the overpasses, and the landmarks, and correctly named each one.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:17.949
Well you could do that for billions of times, and never would you produce a perfect map of New York City.

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:26.949
Now to add a little humor, let's say you tried doing this a hundred billion years, and you get excited. You finally got a city map.

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:36.950
But oh no, it's not New York City, it's Warwick, New York. Now you got to start all over going for that map of New York City.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:50.950
I had to give you a little humor. But say this, one living human cell is much more complex, intricately designed than a map of New York City.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:09:00.950
And one human body is made up of about a hundred trillion of such amazing cells all working together harmoniously.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:08.950
Well in the second part, how does a Bible build faith in itself? That it is the Word of God.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:20.950
Well for one thing, everything the Bible recommends works, brings superior results, how to raise children, how to have a happy marriage, and so forth.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:27.950
Think about it. Humans simply aren't smart enough to recommend only what works.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.950
And their advice is constantly being revised and updated, isn't it?

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:41.950
Though written hundreds, thousands of years ago, the Bible has never needed to be revised, yet everything it recommends works.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.950
It has to be from a higher source than humans.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:51.950
Well in the third part, how does a Bible build faith in God's moral standards?

00:09:51.950 --> 00:10:02.950
Well it tells us what they are. It encourages us to obey them. And when we do, it protects us physically, emotionally, spiritually.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.950
We get happiness, we get a good conscience. We experience the benefits.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:13.950
Thus, we don't have to learn the painful process of trial and error.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:24.950
There's a saying that experience is the best teacher. Completely wrong. Experience is a school of hard knocks.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:34.950
Jehovah is the best teacher. Jehovah is making the inexperienced one wise, according to Psalm 19.7.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.950
Well the fourth part, how does a Bible build faith in God's love for us?

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:50.950
The most powerful way it explains how Jehovah gave his firstborn son to die for us so that we could have everlasting life.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:57.950
Now think about it. What are most people give away if they give something away? Something they don't need.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:05.950
Or at least something they can do without. But Jehovah gave at great cost, great pain to himself.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:20.950
Evolution teaches that our ancestors were apes. How could we feel happy and feel loved thinking that an ape was our father?

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:29.490
But our real father, Jehovah, is the personification of love.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:37.490
But now, Friday afternoon, we had our second symposium, which opened the book of creation.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:42.490
And peering into this book can empower our faith.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:47.490
First, let's talk about the first talk that dealt with the stars.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:54.490
Isaiah 40, verse 26, tells this, that Jehovah created all of them.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:12:01.490
And he calls all of them by name. Now let's ponder this for a moment.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:10.490
How long would it take you to name just the stars in the Milky Way galaxy if you named one every second?

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:23.490
Joseph, Paul, Rachel, Sarah. Well, scientists estimate there are perhaps 400 billion stars just in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:32.490
So if you named one a second, it would take you 400 billion seconds. Now how long is that? 12,684 years.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.490
More than twice the time that has passed since the creation of Adam.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:48.490
And then you could go to the next galaxy. And scientists estimate there may be two trillion galaxies in the universe.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:56.490
That's five times the number of galaxies as there are individual stars in the Milky Way.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:06.490
Now you ponder that. It'll really give you a headache. Yet Jehovah created sustains and calls every one of them by name.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:17.490
And the talk made to point, if Jehovah can do that, he will have no problem remembering and recreating all those sleeping in the memorial tombs.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:23.490
The second talk examined the page in the book of creation about the oceans.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:30.490
How powerful they are. But the one who made them is vastly more powerful.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:39.490
And our powerful God definitely can protect us now and right through the great tribulation.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:52.490
The third talk examined the page in creation about the forest. And it was discussed how forest have the amazing ability to repair and renew themselves.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:14:05.490
And the point was made the one who had the wisdom to create such forest surely knows how to undo all the damage that man has done to the planet earth.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:21.490
The fourth talk focused on wind and water. And it talked about how Jehovah in the past has used wind and water and especially water in the form of hail to defeat his enemies and deliver his people.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.490
Well, he will use them again at arm again.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:38.490
The fifth talk took a glimpse into the fascinating world of sea creatures. And we looked at the largest animal alive on earth today, the Blue Whale.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:51.490
And what an appetite that Blue Whale has. It can eat according to the video tons of food every day. Yet Jehovah feeds it.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:15:05.490
Now if he can do that, can he not feed and care for us? If we continue to seek first the kingdom, well our faith was strengthened that he can and he will.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:18.490
The last talk examined our amazing bodies. As discussed, it's miraculous how our bodies heal and repair themselves when damaged.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:33.490
Now think of this, if you damage scraper dent your car, does it heal itself? Hardly. What if every time we brew scraped damaged our body, it just stayed that way.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:38.490
In a short time, we'd get to looking pretty rough.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:50.490
The God who made our bodies this miraculous way certainly can heal all infirmities, reverse aging and prevent sickness in his new world.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.490
And he has promised to do that.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:16:05.490
Well, the third symposium went back to our main book that builds faith, the Bible. And we discussed ones who acquired strong faith.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:23.490
We discussed how they did it. And even though their contemporaries were faithless, they developed this faith. Well our faith was empowered as we discussed able, Enoch, Noah, Moses, Jesus disciples.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:32.490
And we became more determined than ever to imitate these faithful ones and not their faithless contemporaries.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:42.490
And we know we can be successful because we have the same father, helper, supplier of Holy Spirit as they had.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:55.490
Yes, our three symposiums on Friday clearly showed us that Jehovah answers our pleas for more faith by means of two books, the Bible and the book of creation.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:08.490
Well regarding our drama, we ask, how did Jehovah answer Daniel's pleas for more faith? Well one way, he gave Daniel his written word.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:19.490
In the drama, if you recall, Daniel's father gave him a scroll that he regularly referred to. Did you recognize that scroll?

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:33.490
The scroll depicted in the drama is known today as Psalm 27. When enemies tried to discredit Daniel, we saw him reflect on Psalm 27, 11 and 12, which says in part,

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:44.490
Do not hand me over to my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen up against me, and they threaten me with violence.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:54.490
When he was threatened with execution, we saw him reflect on Psalm 27, 7 through 9, which says in part,

00:17:54.490 --> 00:18:08.490
You are my helper. Do not forsake me or leave me my God of salvation. How those verses would have bolstered Daniel's faith?

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:21.490
Of course we cannot say for sure that Daniel reflected on those specific verses, but the Bible does reveal that Daniel's faith indeed was strengthened by the Scriptures.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:30.490
And we know that Daniel was a keen student of Bible prophecy. He even said of himself at Daniel 9, verse 2,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:42.490
I Daniel discerned by the books, that is the sacred books, the number of years, and then he talks about the desolation restoration of Jerusalem, namely 70 years.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:59.059
But now we ask, will Jehovah answer our pleas for more faith? Most definitely he will. And one outstanding way he has done this is by providing us with Bible prophecy.

00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:13.059
Prophecies in the book of Daniel alone have helped millions to build rock-solid faith. For example, the fulfill prophecies regarding the King of the North and the King of the South

00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:27.059
have been very faith strengthening. In fact, let's review the video on this topic that appeared in Brother Kenneth Cook's May Broadcast. Enjoy this powerful video.

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:47.619
Daniel received a prophecy about the coming of two rivals, the King of the North and the King of the South. How has it been fulfilled?

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:58.619
In the late 1800s, the German Empire became the King of the North. That government brought its power and heart against the King of the South with a large army.

00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:13.339
In fact, its navy was the second largest on earth, who became the King of the South, the alliance between Britain and the United States.

00:20:13.339 --> 00:20:28.259
He fought during World War I with an exceedingly large and mighty army. He swept away and humbled the King of the North. But that was not the end of the King of the North.

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:41.259
He turned his attention to and then hurled denunciations against the Holy Covenant. He removed the constant feature by limiting the freedom of God's people to preach,

00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:57.460
imprisoning many, and even killing hundreds of God's anointed ones and their fellow workers. After Germany was defeated in World War II, the Soviet Union became the King of the North.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:24.250
It worked with the King of the South to put in place the disgusting thing that causes desolation, the United Nations. Beginning in the early 1900s, the Soviet government tried to eliminate religion in the lands under its control.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:40.390
Fulfilling the words that he would show no regard for the God of his fathers. He gave glory not to the God of heaven, but to the God of fortresses.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:50.339
As prophesied, he used this military might against the King of the South by engaging with him in a pushing.

00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:59.339
Anglo-America competed with the Soviet Union for world domination, fighting in and supporting wars and political struggles around the globe.

00:22:04.049 --> 00:22:11.049
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was unclear who would fill the role of the King of the North.

00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:17.049
For a time, God's people there had been able to preach and worship peacefully.

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:29.049
But in recent years, Russia and its allies have pushed back at the King of the South. Both kings have accused each other of destructive cyber and economic attacks.

00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:42.049
But the King of the North has not limited his attacks to the King of the South. As for told, he also entered into the land of the decoration, our realm of spiritual activity.

00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:54.900
Today, Russian authorities continue to attack true worship. We expect such persecution. But we also expect it to end.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:27.859
Our King, Jesus Christ, is more powerful than any human government. Soon, he will destroy not only the kings of the North, South, but all of his enemies.

00:23:27.859 --> 00:23:32.859
And he will deliver God's loyal people.

00:23:32.859 --> 00:24:04.730
What a powerful video.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:11.730
Has the unerring accuracy of those prophecies strengthened your faith?

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:21.730
We're confident that it has. And we're absolutely convinced that the rest of that prophecy, including our deliverance, will be fulfilled.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:30.730
Christ soon will defend God's people and bring an end to this entire wicked system.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:47.730
May all of us continue to study these and other prophecies. If we do, our faith and our wise, our all-powerful, our loving Father will definitely be strengthened.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:58.730
But now, let's move to Saturday's program, which had the theme taken from Jude 3, put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:14.730
The symposium, successful fighters for the faith, show that many who do not have a spouse, and many whose spouse is not yet serving Jehovah, are winning their fight for the faith.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:20.730
And we warmly commend you dear beloved ones.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:33.730
The baptism discourse encouraged new disciples to continue strengthening their faith. And we warmly welcome all newly baptized ones.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:40.730
Jehovah loves you very much. The governing body loves you very much. Your brothers and sisters love you very much.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:51.730
And we're so happy to have you join us in our united family of intense fighters for the faith.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:26:08.730
The two afternoon symposiums helped us to analyze how we can show our faith by giving of our time, energy, material things to advance the kingdom work and to help others.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:20.730
And we discuss some specific things that we may be able to do. For example, learn a new language. Move and serve with a need is greater.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:31.730
Apply for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers. Assist with a building project. Set something aside for Jehovah's work.

00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:45.009
The talk put up a hard fight for the faith. Reminded us that as is true in all fights. In our fight, we have enemies.

00:26:45.009 --> 00:26:57.009
For one thing, we must reject apostate lies in the false stories of other opposers which are designed to so doubt and weaken faith.

00:26:57.009 --> 00:27:22.009
Satan is very skilled at using innuendo, half-truths and lies. So it's not surprising that the news media, which is often manipulated by apostates, clergymen and other opposers, likewise often employs innuendo, half-truths and lies against Jehovah's organization.

00:27:22.009 --> 00:27:38.009
Think about this. Faith is a prog of Holy Spirit. It's a provision from Jehovah to strengthen us. Whereas doubt is a tool of the devil designed to weaken us.

00:27:38.009 --> 00:27:51.009
Do you recall how Satan approached Eve? Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden? Is that really so?

00:27:51.009 --> 00:28:04.009
Why did he present it that way? To plant doubt and shipwreck her faith, and he succeeded. Well, likewise, if we're not careful, doubt can shipwreck our faith.

00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:10.009
But strong faith keeps doubt out of our hearts and minds.

00:28:10.009 --> 00:28:20.009
But now talking just a little bit more about apostates, what if an apostate knocked at your front door and said, I'd like to come into your home.

00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:30.009
I'd like to sit down with you and I'd like to teach you some apostate ideas. Well, you would immediately get rid of him, wouldn't you?

00:28:30.009 --> 00:28:41.009
You would send him down the highway. But now think of this. What if that same apostate tries to come into your home by means of the television or computer?

00:28:41.009 --> 00:28:47.009
Well, hopefully we reject him just as decisively.

00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:59.009
Second John 10 says, if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, never receive him into your home.

00:28:59.009 --> 00:29:16.009
That would mean not through the front door, not through the television or computer. Sadly, though some have reasoned foolishly, if I listen to this apostate on television or the computer, or perhaps read his book, I'll recognize how wrong he is.

00:29:17.009 --> 00:29:26.009
It'll build up my faith. And if I ever encounter this teaching in the ministry, I'll better be able to refute it.

00:29:26.009 --> 00:29:36.009
Well, that is foolish thinking indeed. That would be like reasoning if I ate stinky rotten food from a garbage can.

00:29:36.009 --> 00:29:45.009
It'll really help me in the future to recognize bad food. Not very good reasoning, is it?

00:29:46.009 --> 00:29:57.009
Rather than feed our minds, poison apostate ideas, we read God's word daily and strengthen and safeguard our faith.

00:29:57.009 --> 00:30:09.009
But now we ask, how did Daniel put up a hard fight for the faith? Well, for one thing, he resisted pressure to compromise.

00:30:09.009 --> 00:30:16.009
But can you imagine the pressure he must have faced when offered the King's delicacies and wine?

00:30:16.009 --> 00:30:24.009
How is he able to refuse? Well, for the answer, let's go to Daniel chapter 1, please.

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:28.009
And let's read number, verse number 8.

00:30:29.009 --> 00:30:41.009
1-8, but Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the King's delicacies or with the wine he drank.

00:30:41.009 --> 00:30:49.009
So he asked the principal court official for permission not to defile himself in this way.

00:30:49.009 --> 00:30:57.009
So notice, in advance, Daniel resolved in his heart the course he was going to take.

00:30:57.009 --> 00:31:07.700
And he did so because he was fully convinced that whatever Jehovah had commanded was for his good.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:22.700
Well, like Daniel, we must put up a hard fight for the faith. Are you facing pressure right now at school, at work, or even at home to compromise?

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:33.700
If so, please don't give up and don't give in. Reflect on Daniel's example and fight for your faith.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:45.700
Be resolved to obey Jehovah because doing so is always the right thing. And if you do, you will have no regrets.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:58.700
Pressure was also put on Daniel by means of threats. But can you imagine how Daniel felt when he became aware that his next prayer could lead to his execution?

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:06.700
What helped him to stay loyal? Well, let's go to Daniel chapter 6 and get some help with that question.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:13.700
Daniel chapter 6 and please, let's read together verse number 10.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:25.700
But as soon as Daniel knew that the decree had been signed, he went to his house, which had the windows of his roof chamber open toward Jerusalem,

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:33.700
and three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed and offered praise before his God.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:45.700
Now notice, as he had regularly done prior to this, so Daniel knew what was right and he didn't hesitate to do it.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:55.700
And he was consistent in his worship. Daniel chapter 6 verse 16 tells us that Daniel was continually serving his God.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:08.700
And what Char explains, the original Bible word translated continually serving basically means to move in a circle, which suggests continuity.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:17.700
And how well that describes Daniel's unbroken worship. See, there's no end to a circle. It's unbroken. Is it not?

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:29.700
Please watch the following dramatization that depicts a brother who faces a threat of being arrested, but by reflecting on Daniel's example.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:38.700
He is helped to continue serving Jehovah with constancy in the face of this intimidating circumstance.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:51.259
It's still chaos in many parts of the city, with armed soldiers detaining and arresting those not pledging support of the new government.

00:33:51.259 --> 00:33:53.259
Are we still going to the meeting tonight?

00:33:53.259 --> 00:34:10.170
I wanted to do what was best for my wife and daughter, but a few of the elders have already been arrested. What if I was arrested?

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:48.139
What happened to my family?

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.139
You're not going on a prayer, are you?

00:34:50.139 --> 00:35:02.440
I pray at my window three times a day, every day, if I even appear to compromise.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.440
What would they think?

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:11.440
I know Jehovah, and if I trust him, he'll reward me.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:18.420
I don't know how, but he will.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:28.420
Pray that I keep my faith, that we all keep our faith, no matter how this ends.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:38.460
The scriptures are clear. We must continue to meet together, even in small groups, if necessary.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:46.630
Let's just pray that whatever happens, we have the strength to endure it.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:49.630
Dear Jehovah God, please.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:36:03.260
Eventually, I was arrested.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:08.260
We miss you so much, but we're very proud of you.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:17.750
We know whatever the outcome of your trial you'll maintain your faith, and so will we.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.750
Are you scared?

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:26.860
I was very scared, but Jehovah helps us when we're scared.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:36.349
I knew I would be okay, and that Jehovah would take care of my family.

00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:46.199
But as was true of the brother in our video, we will be persecuted.

00:36:46.199 --> 00:36:54.199
2 Timothy 312 says, all those desiring to live with Godly devotion and association with Christ Jesus,

00:36:54.199 --> 00:36:58.199
will also be persecuted.

00:36:58.199 --> 00:37:01.199
It didn't say maybe good chance, probably.

00:37:01.199 --> 00:37:05.199
We'll be persecuted, guaranteed.

00:37:05.199 --> 00:37:13.199
But like our brother in the video, when persecuted, let's reflect on Daniel's example.

00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:15.199
And let's fight for our faith.

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:23.199
And let's pray confident that our God is always mightier than our enemies.

00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:27.199
Let's be like young David when he went out to meet Goliath.

00:37:27.199 --> 00:37:30.199
Now David saw the big picture, didn't he?

00:37:30.199 --> 00:37:34.199
Sure, he saw how big Goliath was, but in the big picture,

00:37:34.199 --> 00:37:43.199
he saw how puny Goliath was compared to his Almighty God, Jehovah.

00:37:43.199 --> 00:37:51.199
In a unique way, Daniel also experienced how mighty Jehovah is when he was thrown into the lion's pit.

00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:56.199
Jehovah sent an angel to shut the mouths of those lions.

00:37:56.199 --> 00:37:57.199
Now think about it.

00:37:57.199 --> 00:38:02.199
Those lions obviously were very hungry because a little bit later when people were thrown in there,

00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:05.199
they were consumed before they hit the bottom of the pit.

00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:07.199
So they were very hungry.

00:38:07.199 --> 00:38:11.199
And Daniel would have looked like a tasty morsel.

00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:20.199
But no matter how hard they tried, those lions couldn't get their mouths open to harm Daniel.

00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:28.199
Daniel also said a good example in remaining hopeful despite old age and infirmities.

00:38:28.199 --> 00:38:36.199
But can you imagine how Daniel felt when he was almost a hundred years old and many Jews left for their beloved homeland Judah?

00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:39.199
And he was unable to go with them?

00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:43.199
But what helped him to keep his hope alive?

00:38:43.199 --> 00:38:46.199
Let's go to Daniel chapter 10, please.

00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:49.199
Let's see one thing that helped Daniel.

00:38:49.199 --> 00:38:54.199
Daniel 10, beginning in verse 18, Daniel says,

00:38:54.199 --> 00:39:00.199
The one who looked like a man touched me again and strengthened me.

00:39:00.199 --> 00:39:05.199
Then he said, Do not be afraid, O very precious man.

00:39:05.199 --> 00:39:07.199
May you have peace.

00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:08.199
Be strong.

00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:10.199
Yes, be strong.

00:39:10.199 --> 00:39:14.199
As he spoke with me, I was strengthened.

00:39:14.199 --> 00:39:18.199
And I said, Let my Lord speak.

00:39:18.199 --> 00:39:21.199
For you have strengthened me.

00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:31.199
So through an angel, Jehovah reassured Daniel that he was precious and still very useful to him.

00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:34.199
Well, Daniel accepted the encouragement, didn't he?

00:39:34.199 --> 00:39:43.199
And thereafter, Jehovah gave him a thrilling prophecy about the King of the North, the King of the South, which he recorded for our benefit.

00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:51.199
Although old and infirm, this precious man was still very useful to Jehovah.

00:39:51.199 --> 00:40:12.460
Please watch the following dramatization in which an older brother who feels helpless reflects on how the angel reassured Daniel.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:24.900
It all went by so quickly, pioneering foreign language.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:35.340
Circuit work, there was even a time that I was the one encouraging older ones.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:40.340
I missed those days so much.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:48.340
But now, I am the one in a nursing home.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:59.489
Sometimes, I feel like I have nothing left to offer.

00:40:59.489 --> 00:41:04.570
No, Daniel, you very precious man.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:11.429
I have been sent to you.

00:41:11.429 --> 00:41:13.429
Do not be afraid, Daniel.

00:41:13.429 --> 00:41:17.429
Your words have been heard from the first day you gave your heart to understanding.

00:41:17.429 --> 00:41:20.429
I have no strength.

00:41:20.429 --> 00:41:23.429
There's breath left to me.

00:41:23.429 --> 00:41:25.429
Do not be afraid of very precious man.

00:41:25.429 --> 00:41:27.429
May you have peace.

00:41:27.429 --> 00:41:30.710
Be strong.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:37.159
Be strong.

00:41:37.159 --> 00:41:40.159
Happy as the one who keeps an expectation.

00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:42.159
Go on to the end.

00:41:42.159 --> 00:41:50.159
You will rest, but you will stand up for your life at the end of the days.

00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:53.789
Just checking on you.

00:41:53.789 --> 00:41:54.789
Do you have a minute?

00:41:54.789 --> 00:41:57.789
There's something I've been wanting to share with you.

00:41:57.789 --> 00:42:09.170
Okay, sure.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:12.170
Yes, Jehovah does remember me.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:15.170
And I still have much to offer.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:22.909
That was a very touching video indeed.

00:42:22.909 --> 00:42:28.909
But now we ask, do you have infirmities that keep you from doing what you would like to do?

00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:34.909
If so, reflect on Daniel's example and accept Jehovah's reassurance.

00:42:34.909 --> 00:42:41.909
And remember that what you used to do is still viewed as valuable to Jehovah.

00:42:41.909 --> 00:42:44.909
He will not forget it.

00:42:44.909 --> 00:42:51.909
And your present acts of faithfulness, even if small, are very precious to him.

00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:58.909
We entreat all of you, whether young or old, like Daniel,

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:03.909
do not stop putting up a hard fight for the faith.

00:43:03.909 --> 00:43:11.909
But now, let's talk about today's program, which has the theme taken from Matthew 21-21,

00:43:11.909 --> 00:43:16.909
if you have faith, it will happen.

00:43:16.909 --> 00:43:25.909
In the morning, we enjoyed the faith-strengthening symposium, imitate women of strong faith.

00:43:25.909 --> 00:43:31.909
And in each of the eight parts, the exemplary women of faith who were discussed,

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:35.909
faced mountain-like obstacles.

00:43:35.909 --> 00:43:42.909
Sarah had to leave a comfortable lifestyle for a nomadic lifestyle, and for many years,

00:43:42.909 --> 00:43:45.909
she suffered barrenness.

00:43:45.909 --> 00:43:52.909
Rehab had to take decisive action, a risk of life, to protect the Israelites' spies,

00:43:52.909 --> 00:44:00.909
and take a stand with God's people, and thereafter, she had to give up on immoral lifestyle.

00:44:00.909 --> 00:44:08.909
Hannah continued to serve Jehovah while enduring many years of barrenness and harassment from Panina.

00:44:08.909 --> 00:44:16.909
The captive Israelite girl was forcibly separated from her family by Syrian marauders,

00:44:16.909 --> 00:44:23.909
but nevertheless continued to fearlessly witness to others about Jehovah.

00:44:23.909 --> 00:44:32.909
Mary accepted the difficult assignment of giving virtue, caring for, and training God's son.

00:44:32.909 --> 00:44:41.909
The Phoenician woman, courageously and persistently sought help from Jesus for her demon-possessed daughter,

00:44:41.909 --> 00:44:44.909
and she got that help, didn't she?

00:44:44.909 --> 00:44:54.909
Martha, after the painful loss of her brother to the enemy death, maintained faith and Jesus' ability to raise the dead.

00:44:55.909 --> 00:45:01.909
The two modern day examples that we discussed in the last talk, sisters' ishi and tomb,

00:45:01.909 --> 00:45:12.909
both steadfastly refused to compromise, despite being imprisoned many years, simply because they were Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:45:12.909 --> 00:45:23.909
Yes, each one of these dear sisters faced mountain-like obstacles, but Jehovah rewarded their faith.

00:45:23.909 --> 00:45:32.909
Their faith moved them to expect good things from Jehovah, and Jehovah never, ever left them down.

00:45:32.909 --> 00:45:38.909
Well, what good things do we expect from Jehovah if we maintain strong faith?

00:45:38.909 --> 00:45:43.909
Let's talk about some of the events that we expect to unfold in the near future.

00:45:43.909 --> 00:45:52.909
Now, for one thing, the final part of Nebuchadnezzar's image dream discussed in Daniel chapter 2 will be fulfilled.

00:45:52.909 --> 00:46:03.909
As represented by the four upper parts of that image, four world powers have come and gone just as prophesied.

00:46:03.909 --> 00:46:12.909
Today, the Anglo-American world power symbolized by the feet of iron and clay is dominating.

00:46:12.909 --> 00:46:21.909
And more than ever, we see this last world power living up to being a non-cohesive mixture of iron and clay.

00:46:21.909 --> 00:46:35.909
And just as iron mixed with clay is weaker than solid iron, so too, the Anglo-American world power is weaker than the iron-like Roman power from which it emerged.

00:46:35.909 --> 00:46:49.909
The ability of the Anglo-American world power to act with iron-like strength is weakened by clay-like elements, such as people rising up to claim their rights through insurrection,

00:46:49.909 --> 00:46:54.909
civil rights campaigns, and independence movements.

00:46:54.909 --> 00:47:10.909
As Daniel foretold in chapter 2, verse 42, the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile, and we see that more and more evident today than ever.

00:47:11.909 --> 00:47:26.909
But despite the weakened condition of this final world power, it will not simply disintegrate into self-destruction, go to Daniel chapter 2, and let's notice how it comes to its end.

00:47:26.909 --> 00:47:31.909
Very familiar scripture here, Daniel 2, verse 44,

00:47:57.909 --> 00:48:06.909
And that it crushed the iron, the copper, the clay, the silver, and the gold.

00:48:06.909 --> 00:48:16.909
The grand god is made known to the king, what will happen in the future? The dream is true, and as interpretation is trustworthy.

00:48:16.909 --> 00:48:28.909
This scripture describes how God's kingdom represented by that stone will crush all human governments at Armageddon.

00:48:28.909 --> 00:48:45.909
And interestingly, in Daniel chapter 2, verse 34, it tells us that the stone, God's kingdom, will strike the image representing human governments in the feet of iron and clay, clearly identifying that Armageddon

00:48:45.909 --> 00:48:55.909
will come during the time of the American Anglo-World Power, the final human world power.

00:48:55.909 --> 00:49:08.909
And like Daniel, we have strong faith in the last sentence of verse 45, which says the dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy.

00:49:08.909 --> 00:49:19.909
There's no doubt about it. God's kingdom will destroy all human governments at Armageddon during the time of the Anglo-American world power.

00:49:19.909 --> 00:49:31.909
But now just as the final part of the image dream will soon be fulfilled, the final part of Daniel's vision in chapter 7 will soon be fulfilled.

00:49:31.909 --> 00:49:41.909
Now in chapter 7, Daniel describes four wild beasts, which symbolize four world powers that have come and gone.

00:49:41.909 --> 00:49:51.909
And appropriately, they're described as wild beasts, because they haven't ruled kindly, but rather in a harsh, beastly way.

00:49:51.909 --> 00:50:07.909
Now those four world powers are Babylon, Middle Persia, Greece, and Rome, the very same four world powers represented by the four upper metal parts of the image dream we discussed previously.

00:50:07.909 --> 00:50:16.909
But in verse 8, Daniel describes a horn that grew out of the head of that fourth beast, out of Rome.

00:50:16.909 --> 00:50:24.909
And that horn had eyes, and that horn had a mouth, and that mouth spoke arrogantly.

00:50:24.909 --> 00:50:34.909
Well, this arrogant horn symbolizes the Anglo-American world power again, the last world power.

00:50:34.909 --> 00:50:40.909
But now what was foretold to happen next? We'll go to Daniel chapter 7, please.

00:50:40.909 --> 00:50:48.909
Let's see what happens next. Daniel 7, and please, let's begin in verse number 26.

00:50:48.909 --> 00:51:00.909
But the court sat, and they took away his rulership, that is, that horn's rulership, in order to annihilate him and to destroy him completely.

00:51:00.909 --> 00:51:13.909
And the kingdom and the rulership and the grandeur of the kingdoms under all the heavens were given to the people who are the holy ones of the supreme one.

00:51:13.909 --> 00:51:21.909
Their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all rulerships will serve and obey them.

00:51:21.909 --> 00:51:31.909
The rulership of this arrogant horn is taken away, and it is annihilated and destroyed and replaced by God's kingdom.

00:51:31.909 --> 00:51:48.909
So just as described in the image dream, in this vision, we see that God's kingdom destroys all human governments during the time of the Anglo-American world power and then takes over rulership of the earth.

00:51:48.909 --> 00:51:56.909
How exciting that event, which will take place in the near future, will be.

00:51:56.909 --> 00:52:01.909
But think about it, every preceding part of that prophecy has come true.

00:52:01.909 --> 00:52:10.909
So we have complete confidence, strong faith, that the final part of it will also come true.

00:52:10.909 --> 00:52:20.909
Now there are many other prophecies in the book of Daniel that we didn't have time to discuss that have come true in amazing detail.

00:52:20.909 --> 00:52:30.909
But the fulfillment of so many prophecies totally convinces us that we are deep, deep in the time of the end.

00:52:30.909 --> 00:52:45.909
Very soon we are going to eyewitness the fulfillment of Daniel chapter 12 verse 1, which talks about Michael, the great prince standing up, and it will occur a time of great distress.

00:52:45.909 --> 00:52:53.909
But God's people will escape everyone who has found written down in the book.

00:52:53.909 --> 00:53:09.909
In the video near the beginning of this talk, we saw Michael, the glorified Jesus Christ depicted coming with the angels to rescue Jehovah's people and destroy this wicked system.

00:53:09.909 --> 00:53:20.909
But now if you notice carefully in that video, the wicked were actually shooting their weapons into the sky at Michael.

00:53:21.909 --> 00:53:23.909
Now that's laughable, isn't it?

00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:32.909
Because mankind's most powerful weapons are like wet firecrackers compared to Michael's mighty power.

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:40.909
In fact, in the video, Michael was depicted as coming with no defensive equipment such as a breastplate or shield.

00:53:40.909 --> 00:53:42.909
Doesn't need it.

00:53:42.909 --> 00:53:47.909
He was depicted only with a sword and offensive weapon.

00:53:47.909 --> 00:53:52.909
Now sometimes in our illustrations, he's depicted with a bow and arrow.

00:53:52.909 --> 00:53:55.909
Again, only an offensive weapon.

00:53:55.909 --> 00:54:09.909
But his offensive weapons are powerful, much, much more powerful than needed to do the job of rescuing Jehovah's people and sweeping out of existence,

00:54:09.909 --> 00:54:13.909
Satan's entire wicked system.

00:54:13.909 --> 00:54:21.909
But then after Armageddon, the glorious 1000 year reign of Christ Jesus will begin.

00:54:21.909 --> 00:54:29.909
And during that marvelous time, the last verse of the book of Daniel will be fulfilled.

00:54:29.909 --> 00:54:30.909
Now let's read it.

00:54:30.909 --> 00:54:36.909
The last verse of this book, chapter 12, and let's read verse 13.

00:54:36.909 --> 00:54:39.909
And here's what was said to Daniel.

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:51.909
But as for you, go to the end, you will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.

00:54:51.909 --> 00:54:56.909
Yes, Daniel served Jehovah faithfully until the end of his life.

00:54:56.909 --> 00:54:59.909
He went to the end, didn't he?

00:54:59.909 --> 00:55:02.909
Now he's resting in death.

00:55:02.909 --> 00:55:13.909
But soon he will stand up in the resurrection during Christ's millennial reign for his lot, his place in the new world.

00:55:13.909 --> 00:55:19.909
But we ask, did Daniel have faith in that promise that Jehovah gave him through the angel?

00:55:19.909 --> 00:55:21.909
For a certainty he did.

00:55:21.909 --> 00:55:25.909
He had already demonstrated faith for decades.

00:55:25.909 --> 00:55:31.909
He remained clean when tempted to eat food that would defile him.

00:55:31.909 --> 00:55:37.909
He was diligent in prayer, even when praying meant that he would be executed.

00:55:37.909 --> 00:55:42.909
He never stopped building his faith through Bible study.

00:55:42.909 --> 00:55:46.909
So we can be sure he believed with all his heart.

00:55:46.909 --> 00:55:54.909
That promise Jehovah gave him through the angel that he would stand up in the resurrection and take his place in the new world.

00:55:54.909 --> 00:56:02.909
But now we ask, how can we maintain our faith as Daniel did?

00:56:02.909 --> 00:56:16.909
Well, by staying morally and spiritually clean, not allowing anything to corrupt our faith, by praying constantly with full confidence that Jehovah will answer our prayers.

00:56:16.909 --> 00:56:22.909
And by listening to Jehovah by diligent study of his word.

00:56:22.909 --> 00:56:28.909
Jehovah wants us to have faith that he is our rewarder.

00:56:28.909 --> 00:56:43.909
Hebrews 116 says, whoever approaches God must believe that he is, that he's really there, and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.

00:56:43.909 --> 00:56:47.909
Think about our two brothers shown earlier in this talk.

00:56:47.909 --> 00:56:51.909
The Christian father and the sick brother.

00:56:51.909 --> 00:56:58.909
The Christian father ended up behind bars, and our sick brother was not miraculously healed.

00:56:58.909 --> 00:57:04.909
So was there faith in vain for a certainty no?

00:57:04.909 --> 00:57:09.909
Will Jehovah reward them for a certainty yes?

00:57:09.909 --> 00:57:18.909
If you are facing a similar situation, will Jehovah reward you most definitely yes?

00:57:18.909 --> 00:57:29.909
Please watch the following video, which features the song that we will sing to conclude our convention. Enjoy this video.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000
The Christian father and the sick brother.

00:59:14.980 --> 01:00:49.630
The future is assured, they'll stand again with eyes of faith, my hope is sure, till I indulge.

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:52.630
Till Jehovah claims his faith.

01:00:52.630 --> 01:02:02.440
Partly motivating video. And we look forward to singing that song to conclude our convention.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:15.440
Dear brothers and sisters, faithful children, cherished interested ones. There's no doubt. Right now, we face powerful enemies.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:29.440
For one thing, we have a powerful enemy inside our bodies. Inherited sin. It wages an intense war against our desire to do what is right.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:44.440
Secondly, we have the formidable foes, Satan, and his demons. Satan is described as a devouring lion, a cunning serpent, a fierce dragon,

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.440
a sneaky bird catcher, and he's given other evil descriptions.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:03:00.440
Ephesians 6.12 says we have a struggle. The footnote literally a wrestling against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:13.440
As mentioned in our publications, there may be tens of thousands of these powerful evil spirit creatures in the invisible realm waging war against us.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:26.440
Thirdly, we have this wicked world all around us that is trying to assimilate us into joining them in ungodly conduct.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:37.440
And looking at the ratio, we as Jehovah's people are outnumbered by people of the world, by about 900 to one.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:58.780
But despite the power of those three great enemies, our faith, this product of Jehovah's Invincible Holy Spirit, makes us stronger and stronger individually than all of those three enemies combined.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:03.780
In the near future, another powerful enemy will come against us.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:11.780
This formidable foe is a coalition of nations called Gog in Ezekiel 38.

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:24.780
And Ezekiel 38 says that Gog will come with a great assembly of vast army like clouds covering the land. They will come against God's people.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:35.780
Now, this could be a very intimidating situation. But dear brothers and sisters, your faith will make you stronger than Gog.

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:45.780
And will keep you stronger until Jehovah miraculously intervenes at Armageddon. And if you think about it, Armageddon really is a rescue operation.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:56.780
He will intervene and he will sweep attacking Gog away forever with a broom of annihilation.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:09.780
In the past, faith has helped Gog's people to overcome the most powerful obstacles. And that same product of Holy Spirit will help us do the same.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:24.780
Yes, throughout the centuries, just like today, God's servants such as Daniel have been made powerful, not by natural strength, but through faith.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:37.780
So dear brothers and sisters, faithful children, cherished interested ones, pray earnestly for faith, put up a hard fight to maintain your faith.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:53.780
And trust with all your heart that if you have faith, maintain your faith, walk by faith, you definitely will see all of Jehovah's promises fulfilled.

01:05:53.780 --> 01:06:06.409
Thank you, brother lit. Your talk and this entire convention have strengthened our faith and prepared us for future events.

01:06:06.409 --> 01:06:23.389
All in attendance will be pleased to know that parts one and two of the drama, Daniel, a lifetime of faith, are available now for download on JW.org and in the JW Library app.

01:06:23.389 --> 01:06:43.400
This convention is further proof that Jehovah and his son, Jesus Christ, provide abundantly for our spiritual needs despite difficult world conditions, how we rejoice to be in their loving care.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:59.400
And on behalf of the governing body and all the hardworking members of our Bethel families and translation offices around the world, we thank you for watching the 2021 Regional Convention program.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:08.400
We love you. May your love and faith remain strong and may your hope remain bright.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:13.400
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:22.380
Let's conclude now by singing a song that expresses the power that faith has in our lives.

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:30.380
Please join in singing the original song with eyes of faith, which we heard sung during the concluding talk.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:36.380
After the song, you may have your concluding prayer at your individual locations.

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:44.380
Now, we invite all to sing out along with the watchtower chorus with eyes of faith.

01:07:44.380 --> 01:08:24.039
Why should I feel the light? Why should I feel any foe with Jehovah by my side?

01:08:24.039 --> 01:08:33.039
I will not run and hide. My God is with me this I know.

01:08:33.039 --> 01:08:47.859
With eyes of faith I see beyond the darkness. With eyes of faith there's nothing more to feed.

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:54.859
With Jehovah I am strong determined to go on.

01:08:54.859 --> 01:09:03.100
Being that my God is always me. Eyes of faith.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:10:38.340
Their faith, their future is assured. They'll stand against faith with eyes I end.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:11:09.250
Jehovah claims his victory.
