WEBVTT

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.219
Well, brothers and sisters, hasn't this been an amazing program?

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:20.670
This is truly a historic day in the history of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.269
And maybe our hearts right now are more full of love and appreciation for our wonderful God, Jehovah,

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:37.869
than ever before. We've deepened our understanding of Jehovah's mercy, his compassion, and his patience.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.429
And what about that announcement about our field service reporting?

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:52.990
Jehovah is dignifying us. He has confidence in us. You see, why do we go from house to house?

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.670
Why do we do cart work? Why do we make telephone calls and write letters and make return visits and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.790
start Bible studies? Why do we do all of these things? It's because we truly

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.030
love our amazing and wonderful God, Jehovah. As Brother Flegal emphasized in his talk,

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:24.590
at Matthew 22 and verse 37, Jesus identified the greatest and first commandment. Do you remember what

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:34.109
he said? You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:42.189
your whole mind. But is there something else that moves us to make disciples? Yes.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.870
It's what Jesus said was the second greatest commandment. Jesus said, you must love your neighbor

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:03.469
as yourself. So we must love God, but we must also love people. Now, why is love for people so

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:14.270
important? Well, because when we see that someone cares about us, we are moved even if we don't know

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.270
that person. For example, maybe someone you've never met before does a kind deed for you. Maybe

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.110
they open a door for you. They pick something up that you've dropped or they help you carry a heavy

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:34.110
load. How do you feel? Well, you appreciate their kindness, don't you? And as a result, you're more

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.949
inclined to want to listen to what that person might want to say to you. You see, when we sense

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:54.110
that someone has love for us, we open up our hearts. Well, unselfish love is so powerful. It

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:03.150
touches the hearts of those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life. And Jesus said that his

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:11.389
true disciples would be identified. They'd be recognized by the love that they had in their midst.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.430
Well, isn't it true that so often brothers and sisters say that what it was that drew them to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.229
the truth was the love they felt from their Bible teacher or from the congregation when they

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:34.349
began to attend meetings. Well, very likely, that same love was what drew you to want to become

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:42.509
a disciple of Christ Jesus. Well, for that reason, at the 2017 annual meeting, the governing body

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:50.189
encouraged us to begin to think more about conversing with people. And at that same meeting,

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:57.469
you remember we simplified our teaching toolbox so that we could become more familiar with the

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:05.710
various tools that we use in the ministry. You see, we want to carefully consider each individual's

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:14.509
personal situation, the concerns that they have, the interests that they have, and then be flexible

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:22.350
in choosing a topic that we want to discuss with them. Well, for several years now, our midweek meetings

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:30.110
have provided us with sample conversations, with suggested scriptures, and even with a suggested

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:38.990
link to help us to continue the conversation at a later time. But is there a challenge sometimes

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.029
with a memorized presentation? You know, I think back when I was a brand new pioneer, one day I was

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.430
out with his sister in the ministry. As we were going to the door, you know, she was actually

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.990
mouthing her presentation. She had it perfectly memorized. And suddenly this woman came to the door,

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.189
she opened the door, and here she was, beautiful older lady, hair done, makeup on, beautifully

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:07.470
dressed, looking like she was just going out. The sister was so flustered, she said, oh, I'm sorry,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:25.870
did we get you out of bed? Yeah, memorized presentations. Not always good. Well, maybe we've memorized

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.189
presentations. And sometimes we felt like we're giving a talk when we're at the door. But what if the

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:38.350
person has a very specific interest? What if they have some special need or they're facing some

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.149
terrible challenge just at the time when we're calling? Well, we want to look to the example of our

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:53.870
Lord Jesus Christ. He set the perfect example for us. He showed love for people by choosing subjects

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:01.709
that were appropriate for each individual and his personal interest in individuals attracted

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:08.029
people to the message. Well, for example, do you remember the time when Jesus had a conversation

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:15.790
with the Pharisee Nicodemus? Now, Nicodemus was impressed by Jesus' miracles, and he approached

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:23.310
Jesus at night probably because he was afraid of the Jews. Now, as a Pharisee and a teacher,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.389
Nicodemus evidently must have had a very great knowledge of the Hebrew scriptures. So what did

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:37.310
Jesus do? Well, he shared something with Nicodemus that was completely new. You see, he talked about new

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:45.069
truths about being born again and about seeing the kingdom of God. He explained to Nicodemus that he

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:52.430
had descended from the heavens and that he was the only begotten Son of God and that he was the way

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:59.550
to everlasting life. Well, I'm sure you'd agree that even though Nicodemus was a teacher,

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:08.110
he received quite an education from Jesus on that night. But now, does that mean that Jesus took

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:15.230
exactly that same approach with everyone that he met? Well, no, not at all. You see, on another

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:21.069
occasion, when Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman, his approach was completely different.

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:27.310
Evidently, the Samaritan woman had a very basic knowledge of the Hebrew scriptures.

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:34.110
So what did Jesus do? Well, he noted the things she was interested in like obtaining water

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:41.629
and why Jesus, as a Jew, would speak with a Samaritan. Well, Jesus also took an interest

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:48.269
in her family situation. He noted that she was very concerned about why did Jews

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:54.509
worship in one location and Samaritans in a different location? What did Jesus do?

00:07:55.149 --> 00:08:00.829
Well, he talked with her about the things that interested her that were of concern to her. He

00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:07.709
helped her to see that worshiping was spirit and truth was more important than the location

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:14.829
where individuals would worship. And how did that woman respond? Well, the Bible says she left

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:22.110
her water jar there at the well. She went into the city and she gave a powerful witness about Jesus.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:30.029
She was so effective that the Samaritans invited Jesus to stay and many put faith in him.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:38.429
So now, what do we learn from these two simple accounts? Well, Jesus did not use a memorized

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:45.470
presentation. He just talked with people and he shared with them the truths that he knew

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:53.549
would touch their hearts. He was very quick to choose topics and words based on the interests

00:08:53.549 --> 00:09:01.629
and the concerns of the person that he was speaking to. Well, now, with all of this in mind,

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:12.899
you may be wondering what you're supposed to be wondering. How can I display that same love for

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:18.580
the people that I meet? See, wouldn't it be wonderful to have a little bit more help to see how we

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:25.539
can show love for people and make disciples? See, wouldn't it be wonderful to have a publication

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:32.740
that would help us to be more flexible and more responsive to the different needs and interests

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:40.419
of the people that we meet? And what if that publication highlighted specific ways

00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:47.460
that Jesus and other first century evangelizers showed their love as they made disciples?

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:59.200
Well, you will be happy to know that Jehovah's organization has produced just such a publication.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.600
It's a 32-page brochure entitled, Love People Make Disciples.

00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:39.629
But now, would you like to see a little preview of what this brochure contains? Please watch

00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:48.720
the following video. This new publication, Love People Make Disciples, is being made available in

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:56.320
both print and digital formats in over 400 languages. How is the brochure designed to help us show

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:04.000
love for people we meet? Unlike the tools we've used in the past, this new brochure

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.600
does not give us expressions to memorize, nor does it put the emphasis on leaving literature.

00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:18.419
Rather, it features 12 lessons that focus on qualities we need to cultivate to make disciples.

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:25.940
All the lessons are based on Bible accounts, in which Jesus or another first century evangelizer

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:32.659
displayed a specific quality in the ministry. The lessons will help us see how we can imitate

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:39.779
the qualities they demonstrated as we make disciples. Each lesson contains a video that brings

00:11:39.779 --> 00:12:01.889
the account to life. A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Give me a drink. By cultivating an

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:09.470
interest in people, we can talk about things that are on their minds. What truths might we share

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:16.750
with people once a conversation is started? Appendix A highlights basic Bible truths that we love to

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:23.870
teach. Make it your goal to learn these basic truths and the scriptures that support them.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:30.590
If you do, you will be more effective in starting conversations and in making disciples.

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:36.669
For example, a conversation can be started by asking a simple question, such as,

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:45.309
have you heard that God will soon end all suffering? Or did you know that the earth's environment

00:12:45.309 --> 00:12:57.250
will be restored? Sharing a simple truth at the right time is powerful. Jesus said his sheep would

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:03.970
listen to his voice. In other words, rightly disposed ones will recognize the truth when they hear

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:11.009
it expressed simply. Appendix B helps us to determine whether to continue a conversation.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:19.169
Appendix C provides practical suggestions on how to conduct Bible studies and enjoy life forever.

00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:24.850
What if you don't feel comfortable starting conversations? Don't worry.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:32.049
Beginning in January 2024, the apply yourself portion of each midweek meeting will help us to

00:13:32.049 --> 00:13:38.610
practice the points we are learning in this new brochure. The meeting will no longer focus on

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:44.690
presenting a predetermined topic in scripture. Rather, students will select topics for their

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:50.450
assignments that they know are on the minds of those in their community. By means of realistic

00:13:50.450 --> 00:14:02.590
demonstrations, audience discussions, and talks, our meetings will assist us to develop skills that

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:08.669
will help us start conversations naturally and adapt to each person's concerns and needs.

00:14:10.429 --> 00:14:17.389
By focusing on people, we will become more comfortable and more effective as we make disciples.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:25.259
As you consider each lesson, think carefully about how you can demonstrate the highlighted

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:32.700
qualities when conversing with people in your community. Ask yourself, what are their concerns and

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:40.700
needs? As you go about your activities, be observant. Look for appropriate opportunities to

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:47.899
help people in practical ways. Acts of kindness can open the door to share kingdom truth.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.899
Show that you care by listening to others when they express themselves.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:04.139
Share a simple truth at the right time. Remember, our goal is not to memorize the presentation,

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:10.620
but to demonstrate Christ-like love to everyone we meet. This will require patience,

00:15:13.169 --> 00:15:24.980
perseverance, and commitment. No matter where we live, or under what circumstances we are preaching,

00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:37.009
simply showing love will help us to find joy in our ministry. More than any specific technique,

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:43.250
actively expressing our love for others will help us make disciples.

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:13.730
So, we indeed thank Jehovah for this wonderful new tool to make us more effective in our ministry.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:21.809
Of course, the question you may be wondering is, when will you receive your copy of this new brochure?

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.970
Well, you'll be pleased to know that it's going to be made available to all congregations in

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:38.450
electronic format and, in most places, in printed format by November 6. In addition,

00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:47.090
this entire four-part symposium will be posted on JW.org on November 6 so that all of our

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:54.210
brothers and sisters will hear the information in this symposium at the same time. Isn't that great?

00:16:58.899 --> 00:17:03.700
Of course, we're all going to want to read the brochure. We're going to want to watch the videos,

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.740
but wasn't it wonderful to hear in this video that the governing body has arranged

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:14.819
to make use of this new publication beginning in the month of January during our midweek meeting.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:21.380
So, we're going to get the opportunity to put this into practice right away. So, what have we learned

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:28.900
in this four-part symposium? In Part 1, Brother Flegal reminded us why we love Jehovah,

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:34.420
and how our love motivates us to want to praise him. In Part 2, Brother Loche,

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:40.420
explained the differences between most Israelites and those who volunteer to be Nazareth.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:47.380
In Part 3, Brother Heard helped us to see that although congregation publishers will no longer

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:54.740
report their time in the ministry, this in no way diminishes our individual responsibility

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:02.740
to make disciples. And finally, in this part, we received a new tool that will help us to show

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:10.900
our love for people and to make disciples. It's really amazing to witness, as Jehovah's people,

00:18:11.539 --> 00:18:19.329
the fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 60 and verse 17. You remember the prophecy there.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:29.089
It says, instead of the copper, I will bring in gold. And instead of the iron, I will bring in silver.

00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:37.730
Instead of the wood, copper. And instead of the stones, iron. And I will appoint peace as your

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:45.569
overseers and righteousness as your task assigners. Well, what's the point of the prophecy?

00:18:46.369 --> 00:18:54.609
You see, it outlines that good materials would gradually be replaced by even better ones.

00:18:55.329 --> 00:19:02.369
And that's exactly what we have seen. You think back in the 1930s, when our brothers became

00:19:02.369 --> 00:19:07.809
so zealous in the ministry, they went out with phonographs and testimony cards.

00:19:08.529 --> 00:19:13.730
But of course, at that time, they didn't speak. Either the record did the speaking or people read

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:20.369
the card. My mother loved to tell the story about being in the service with her pioneer partner.

00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:24.529
The door opened. She handed the man the testimony card. Of course, it didn't say anything.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.890
The man started to read it. Suddenly his wife called out, who's at the door?

00:19:31.089 --> 00:19:36.049
The man said, I don't know. There's two deaf women here and I'm trying to figure out what they want.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:47.150
Well, that was the reality. We weren't speaking.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:56.430
But how Jehovah improved the situation? He trained his people how to give an effective witness.

00:19:57.069 --> 00:20:02.029
And then we had publications like reasoning from the scriptures that helped us to learn how to

00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:08.589
use the Bible to reason with people. And more recently, Jehovah has given us this marvelous tool,

00:20:08.589 --> 00:20:14.589
enjoy life forever so that we can conduct much more quality Bible studies.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:23.069
And now with the release of this brochure, we're going to focus on people and talk about the things

00:20:23.069 --> 00:20:30.190
that are of interest to them and in that way endeavor to reach their heart so that they can become

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:37.309
disciples. Well, it's true. With each of these organizational adjustments, we went from

00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:42.910
something good to something better. And I think with the things that were announced today,

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:49.470
isn't it true that we're seeing that again? We're going from something that was good to something

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:57.069
even better. And I think we'd agree too that Jehovah is helping us to mature as a people.

00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:04.990
He has confidence in us that our concern is not merely the number of hours or the publications

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:11.230
that we place that we're going to put on a report. We love Jehovah, we love people,

00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:16.829
and we want to make disciples. And so what does all of this mean?

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:27.950
And what does it not mean? Well, first, these adjustments do not, they do not mean that we are in

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:36.430
any way slacking off in our ministry. It does not mean that we are slowing down as we approach

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:44.029
the Great Tribulation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Right now, we have more than 50,000

00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:50.430
applications from students who want to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers. We're appointing

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:59.150
new missionaries, new special pioneers and temporary special pioneers and an army of new regular

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:05.309
pioneers. And in some lands like the Philippines, sorry, I have to mention the Philippines,

00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:19.710
we're experiencing record growth. Can you imagine a 9% increase this year with a new peak of 253,876

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:29.230
publishers and 12,954 baptized just in this last year. Isn't that amazing?

00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:51.380
So please know, please know that in no way is the work slowing down. Our ministry has never been

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:59.859
more important than it is now. So what then do these adjustments mean? Well, they do mean

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:07.940
that our motivation for carrying out the ministry has been even more clarified. You see, we share

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:15.859
in the ministry because we love Jehovah and because we love people. So this is the time when we want

00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:23.299
to be busy in Jehovah's work. Do you remember Jesus' parable of the master and the three slaves?

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.779
That parable was designed to teach us what we need to be doing while we're waiting for the end

00:23:29.779 --> 00:23:38.579
to come. Two of those slaves were industrious and they doubled the master's money. And as a result,

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:48.180
they were blessed. We want to have that same industrious, diligent spirit. We want elders and

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:53.859
ministerial servants and pioneers to take the lead in the ministry. But all of us,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:03.619
we all in our personal ministry want to be even more zealous in what we have accomplished in our

00:24:03.619 --> 00:24:13.460
ministry. What an exciting time this is. The governing body sincerely hopes that many more

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:21.859
will come to join us in serving Jehovah before the end comes. And remember, Jehovah delights

00:24:21.859 --> 00:24:29.380
in rewarding his people for their faithfulness and for their generosity. So with the great tribulation

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:38.420
fast approaching, have no doubt that Jehovah will soon richly reward you as we all give generously

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:53.299
of our time and our effort to love our amazing God, Jehovah, and to make disciples.
