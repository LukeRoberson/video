00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.589
When I was young, my father wrote to me the Bible verse,

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.589
your word is a lamp to my foot and a light for my path.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.589
And he said, keep that always in mind.

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.589
Remember God's word and live by it.

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:27.750
I was born in 1929 in the city of Furu, Estonia.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.750
My family was religious and my God-fearing parents

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.750
lovingly cared for me and provided everything

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.479
that a child would need.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.479
When my father learned the truth, he gave each of us a Bible

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.479
and we began to study it together.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:52.810
My father was arrested in the summer of 1948.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.810
Estonia was now under the Soviet regime,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
but he was still working as a schoolteacher.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.810
The local Department of Education asked him to come by.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.810
He went dressed in summer clothes and wearing sandals

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.810
and he never came back.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:20.489
At midnight, we heard someone banging at the door.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:26.489
We opened it and soldiers came in and demanded our passports.

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:30.829
We put the passports on the table and they just said,

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.829
you are under arrest.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.829
Pugged a prison in Tallinn was a place everyone was afraid of.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.829
And I was afraid too.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.829
I remember that I was taken down the steps to the basement

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.829
to a long corridor.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.349
There was nothing in the cell besides a bench.

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:04.349
They slammed the door shut and that is when I became a little scared.

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.349
But then I prayed to Jehovah to help me

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.349
and a sense of peace came over me.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.349
I lay down on the bench and fell asleep.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:23.830
I was given a ten-year prison sentence

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.379
as an enemy of the state.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.379
A year later, we were transferred to Russian prison camps.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.379
Spiritual food was hard to get.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
It couldn't be sent by mail.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.379
But the angel somehow still provided for us

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.379
and we always had something.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:55.360
Even a single verse or a good thought can help in prison.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.360
In any case, God's word should be in our heart.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.360
We should never forget it, even if we can only remember one verse.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.800
At one point during my sentence,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.800
I was allowed to live outside the prison camp.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.080
One witness family took me and two other sisters into their home.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.080
Living outside meant that the guard was not watching us all the time.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.080
We were able to spend time together

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080
and we could preach a little.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.080
We even went from house to house.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.080
Eventually, I moved to a dormitory

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080
because there was not enough space.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.180
And it also meant that the literature could be stored at my place.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.180
Because if they arrested me, it wouldn't be a big deal.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.180
But if the brother was arrested, it would be much worse.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.090
They raided my place one night.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.090
They put all the literature on the table and asked me where I got it.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.090
I said,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.090
the angels are bringing it to us and feeding us all the time.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.089
So I was sentenced to another two years for possessing literature.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.459
Then for the first time,

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:28.459
I heard that Jehovah's Witnesses were officially banned.

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:33.459
What a good feeling it was to be recognized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:39.060
That really gave me joy.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.060
I saw Jehovah's help and that things were never too hard for me to bear.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.060
If things were getting too difficult,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.060
something would always change so that I could cope.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.060
There was always that feeling that someone was looking after me.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.060
I never felt alone or abandoned.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.620
If only we could be faithful all the time,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.620
then we would also be happy.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.620
But sometimes we fail and so we lose joy.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.620
Faithfulness gives joy.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.620
In prison, you can stay faithful if you don't leave Jehovah

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.620
and if you don't forget to pray

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.620
and if you always remember why you are there.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.620
You are there because you are on Jehovah's side.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.620
I was not a thief.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.620
I was not a killer.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.620
But I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.620
and that is worth being in prison for.
