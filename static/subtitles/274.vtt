One day at school, a boy asked me in front of everybody why I don't salute the flag.

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.839
I had to go up in front of the entire class and give an answer.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.839
I was a little scared, but I knew I had to defend Jove and his name.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.839
I was in a new school and I wasn't expecting to be pressured to smoke electronic cigarettes or vape.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.839
It was really intimidating.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
I was afraid if I didn't do it, I'd get beat up.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.840
But I loved Jove and his standards, so I knew I needed to take a firm stand.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.840
I remembered from family worship and our practice lessons.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.840
The first thing I needed to do was pray to Jove, but the only thing I had time to say was Jove,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.840
please help me.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.840
My personal study and my Bible reading helped me to feed Jove as a close friend.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.840
And my love for him moved me to take a stand.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.840
I quickly found out that just saying no wasn't going to be enough.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.840
My stand for Jove had to be serious and specific.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.840
I needed to rely on him and pray, so I did.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
But I also realized I needed to do research.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.840
I found some Bible principles that really helped me, like not defiling the flesh.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.840
So when the pressure to vape came up again, I prayed to Jove to give me the right words.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.840
He made me calm, and I told them, because of what I read in the Bible, I choose not to vape.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.840
I'm not going to do it. Don't ask me again.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.840
Jove was always with me, and I never, ever felt alone.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.840
He gave me boldness to talk to many students, and I've started many Bible studies.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.840
Thankfully, the pressure stopped, and the kids seemed to really respect me for my stand.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.840
This has helped me to trust and rely on Jove more than ever.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.840
I loved Jove, and I'm so happy I took a stand for him.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.840
I would stand up for any friend, and I'm glad I stood up for Jove,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.840
because he's my very best friend I could ever ask for.
