WEBVTT

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.450
On behalf of the governing body, it is my pleasure to welcome all of you to this year's

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.009
Don't Give Up Regional Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.890
For some of you, this may be your first time attending one of our conventions.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.969
Perhaps you're here because you received one of our invitations.

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:25.969
If so, we're very happy to have you with us.

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:31.850
For the rest of us, it doesn't seem possible that an entire year has passed since our

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.609
last convention.

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:36.729
And what a year it has been.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:42.890
Thanks to over 8 million worshipers of Jehovah, a tremendous witness has been given throughout

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.649
the earth in over 800 languages.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.729
And thanks to the thousands of hardworking volunteers, our new world headquarters was

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.090
completed at Warwick, New York, in the United States.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.729
The surroundings are beautiful and many of the friends have already begun touring our

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.369
new home.

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:10.090
However, other things have taken place in the past year that haven't been so positive.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.010
As the Apostle Paul was inspired to write at 1 Corinthians chapter 7, verse 31, the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.090
scene of this world is changing.

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:22.689
We know you have been watching the world seen as we have.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.609
There have been natural disasters, disease epidemics, political unrest, murderous attacks,

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:33.810
and terror strikes in one place after another.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.370
Perhaps you personally have experienced health or economic challenges, the loss of a loved

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:46.049
one in death, or opposition to the stand that you have taken as a true Christian.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.890
The governing body is very much aware of all of this and wants to help you cope with these

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.689
critical times hard to deal with.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.969
There are three qualities in particular that we are highlighting on our convention programs.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.489
First is loyalty.

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:10.689
Remember last year's convention had the theme remain loyal to Jehovah.

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:15.770
Perhaps you recall these points blinged from that program.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.409
Even close to our Heavenly Father will give us the stability and strength to overcome

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.849
the most daunting obstacles.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.770
And strengthening our loyalty to Jehovah now is essential to remaining loyal under future

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.129
tests, including the upcoming Great Tribulation.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.370
It was our earnest desire that last year's program would help you to cherish your loyalty

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.009
to Jehovah all the more.

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:52.689
This year we are highlighting a second quality that of endurance.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:59.330
The convention theme has been taken from the words founded Galatians 6.9.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.889
Let us not give up in doing what is fine.

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.129
Hence this year's theme is don't give up.

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.449
Each day of our convention we will learn about wonderful Bible examples of endurance.

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:18.129
The greatest example of course is Jehovah God himself.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:24.849
He has patiently endured the reproach brought on his holy name and the pain of watching

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.770
his beloved creation suffer until the appointed time.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:38.849
We will also learn about the endurance of Joseph, Jeff's daughter, Jeremiah, the Apostle

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.810
John and foremost Jesus Christ.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.330
Here are two key points that you'll want to listen for.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.409
Our endurance as Christians does not depend on favorable circumstances.

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:00.409
It results from reliance on Jehovah and our confidence that Jehovah will reward us in

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:06.729
the future is strengthened as we experience him answering our prayers now.

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:12.009
Jehovah's servants today are part of a long line of faithful witnesses who have endured

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.129
with his help.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.569
We sincerely commend you for your loyalty and endurance.

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:26.810
Now what is the third vital quality than one we will highlight during the 2018 convention

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.810
program?

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.410
Well, we'll get to that.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.649
For now, enjoy this program on endurance from the opening music video presentation to

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:43.290
the last talk of each session, please give it your closest attention.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.550
We wish you a wonderful convention.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.509
We certainly hope you have enjoyed these last three days of our Don't Give Up Regional

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.269
Convention.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:05:01.069
We encourage you to stay faithful, come what may in the future.

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:06.870
Then the latter part of Galatians, chapter 6, verse 9, will come true for us all.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.470
And do time, we will reap if we do not tire out.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.589
We feel so strongly about the need for all of us to strengthen our endurance that during

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:24.350
this year, the two circuit assembly programs are developing related themes.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:34.000
Don't give up and fulfilling the law of Christ and don't give up and doing what is fine.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.079
Oh yes, one last thing.

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:42.040
So we discuss the first two qualities, loyalty and endurance.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.120
What do you think will be the third quality that we will emphasize after loyalty and endurance?

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.519
It is courage.

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:53.839
So stay tuned.

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:58.079
Until then, dear brothers and sisters, the governing body wants you to know that we love

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:01.759
you dearly and pray for you constantly.

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:08.560
And remember, the end is imminent and we must not give up, especially now.
