WEBVTT

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.580
Well, now we're looking forward to hearing from a graduate of the 41st class of Gilead,

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.140
a member of the governing body, brother Garrett Loesch.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.660
Brother Loesch has just completed 25 years of service as a member of the governing body.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.899
How wonderful.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:27.710
Brother Loesch will speak to us now on the subject.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.350
Are you ready?

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.119
Are you ready?

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:40.920
As Gilead students, no doubt you have been asked that question many times this week.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.560
The Boy Scouts have the greeting, always prepared.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.840
What are they prepared for?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.960
They're supposed to be ready or prepared for doing at least one good deed each day.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.120
True Christians also are supposed to be always prepared, prepared for what?

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:11.599
Yes, for doing good deeds, but also prepared for the final return of the Lord Jesus

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:16.680
as a mighty heavenly king in the Great Tribulation.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.719
Jesus began to rule over his congregation when?

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:32.439
Well, I'm sure you understand at Pentecost 33 of a common era over his congregation.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.439
Inside book says, the scriptures show, and this is a quote,

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:48.400
that from Pentecost 33 CE onward a spiritual kingdom was set up over his disciples.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.519
Paul reminded Christians of Colosseum.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:58.560
He rescued us from the authority of the darkness and transferred us into the kingdom

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:04.790
of his beloved son, Colossians 1, 13.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:12.590
Jesus has been ruling as king over his disciples ever since Pentecost 33.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.909
He always was the head of the congregation compared to a body.

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.229
So he ruled as king also during the Middle Ages.

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:28.870
However, something changed in 1914 CE, what was it?

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:36.750
Well, from that time onward, Jesus would rule also over his enemies, both in heaven and on earth.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:53.340
The prophecy was fulfilled that we find in Psalm 110, and there it says in Psalm 110,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:03.139
Jehovah declared to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I place your enemies at the stool of my feet.

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:08.139
Jehovah will extend the sceptre of your power out of Zion saying,

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.379
go subduing in the midst of your enemies.

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:20.139
Well, we understand that in 1914 he returned as heavenly king to rule.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:26.300
Since that time, many things are happening, showing us that he's actually ruling in the midst of his enemies.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.139
He's not ruling only over his congregation.

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:38.979
Satan and his agents were not able to prevent the appointment of the faithful and discreet slave.

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:43.219
But what about Jesus' final coming as judge?

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.020
When will that return happen?

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:55.219
Well, we don't know exactly, but Jesus predicted events from which we can conclude when it would be close.

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:00.900
Although Jesus said that we would not be able to know in advance the exact time or date

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:11.139
he prophesied events that would occur from which we could notice the nearness of his final coming as a judge.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:20.259
In the past, many people attempted to pinpoint his return by their expectations and predictions.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:27.899
They aroused curiosity, but many times these predictions failed.

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:35.740
Even in the first century, there already existed among Christians false expectations.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.779
The Thessalonians, for instance, had such.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:43.100
Paul needed to write to them for them to find the balance.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.500
Second, Thessalonians chapter 2, and verse 1,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.579
Onward says,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.060
He says in verse 3,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:30.540
there were many other false expectations during centuries that followed.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:39.459
Marta of Tours, a French bishop, stated the world would end before the year 400.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:49.379
He polytors and two others predicted Jesus to return in the year 500 of our time.

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:58.980
Africanus, Sextus, Julius, with his Latin name predicted it for the year 800.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.420
Of course, also the year 1000 was predicted,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:08.740
including by a Pope, Pope Silvestre as some sources claim.

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:17.540
Pope Innocent, the third, and predicted the end for the year 1244,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.500
which would have been 666 years after the rise of Islam.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:33.220
Famous painter, Sandro Poticelli, predicted the year 1500 and four.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.180
Astrologers in London predicted February 1, 1524,

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:44.939
as a result 20,000 Londoners left their homes for higher ground.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:53.500
1533, Melheur Hoffmann, predicted Christ's second coming to take place that year in Strasbourg.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.500
He claimed that 144,000 people would be saved,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.220
while the rest of the world would be consumed by fire.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.379
Luther, German priest and professor of theology, predicted the end of the world would occur

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:13.180
no later than in the year 1600.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.259
Christopher Columbus, predicted famous, we all know him,

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:30.379
predicted in 1501 in his book of prophecy that the world would end in 1656.

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:38.379
John Napier predicted the end of the world for 1700.

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:45.019
Christopher Love, a Presbyterian minister, predicted the year 1805.

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:53.019
A Lutheran clergyman, Johann Albrecht Bengal, predicted the year 1836.

00:07:53.019 --> 00:08:00.620
And the founder of the Methodist Church, John Wesley, predicted the same year, 1836.

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:08.540
Melheur, a Baptist preacher, predicted the date March 21, 1844, for the return of Christ.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.379
But later he revised it to October 22.

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:20.220
The Adventist preacher Vendel predicted the year 1873.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:27.579
When Jesus did not come, he reinterpreted his prediction, saying that Jesus had returned

00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:30.060
indeed, but in invisible form.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:40.620
Our brothers expected the return of Christ first for 1844 and then for 1914.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:50.779
They also expected initially to be his return visible, but then understood that it would be invisible.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:58.460
They also expected the glorification of the little flock for spring 1918.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:06.620
The year when brother Russell died, 1916, the brothers entered a period of serious

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:14.860
testing, some even left the truth. 1919, faithful ones consolidated again.

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:23.500
100 years have passed, 1919, now 2000, 1900 years.

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:28.059
Would special prophecies be fulfilled 100 years after 1919?

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:34.529
Well, this is just a question. No answer.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.730
There were serious testing during the year 1925 also.

00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:46.690
And for that year, our brothers had great expectations.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:54.850
It said in one of our publications, we may confidently expect that from the booklet,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:06.610
millions now living will never die, that in 1925 it will mark the return from the dead of Abraham,

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:12.610
Isaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old to the condition of human perfection.

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:19.090
Not only was the resurrection of faithful men of old expected in 1925,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:25.409
but some hope that anointed Christians might receive their heavenly reward in that year.

00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:37.389
From the year 1987, we learned that the year 1925 started very promisingly with a new

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:45.230
Bethel home and factory in Beren, Switzerland. However, some had their personal convictions with

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:53.629
respect to that year 1925. Would they let themselves be admonished by the watchtower of January

00:10:53.629 --> 00:11:03.389
1925? The watchtower cautioned, and I quote, the year 1925 is here with great expectation

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:09.149
Christians have looked forward to this year. Many have confidently expected that all members of

00:11:09.149 --> 00:11:15.549
the body of Christ will be changed to heavenly glory during the year. This may be accomplished,

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:23.389
it may not be. In his own due time, God will accomplish his purposes concerning his own people.

00:11:24.029 --> 00:11:30.029
Christians should not be so deeply concerned about what may transpire during this year,

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:34.590
that they would fail to joyfully do what the Lord would have them to do.

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:44.559
Among others, Jacob Weber, who was responsible for the field service desk at the Bethel

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:50.799
or branch in Switzerland, was so sure that all the anointed would be glorified in heaven by the end

00:11:50.799 --> 00:12:01.840
of the year 1925, that he pursued a liquidation course. He sent large quantities of literature

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:09.440
to the congregations without having received orders for it, instructing them to distribute

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.440
the publications free of charge in their territory before the end of 1925.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.240
All the efforts of the brothers at Bethel to reason with him were to no avail. Finally,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:28.720
he left not only Bethel, but even the truth, and caused much grief among the brothers throughout

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:35.840
the country, Switzerland, since he drew many with him. Some congregations were reduced to less than

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:47.179
half the former size. What about expectations for the year, years later, 25, 1975?

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:58.779
In the book, or in the Watchtower, March 15, a comet is made, and it says that in modern times,

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:04.379
such eagerness, commendable in itself, has led to attempts to set dates for the desired

00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:11.820
liberation from the suffering and troubles that are the lot of persons throughout the earth.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:17.100
With the appearance of the book, life everlasting, in freedom of the sons of God,

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.220
and its comments as to how appropriate it would be for the millennial reign of Christ to parallel

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:29.419
this 7th millennium of man's existence, considerable expectation was aroused regarding the year

00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:38.379
1975. There were statements made then, and thereafter stressing that this was only a possibility.

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:46.220
Unfortunately, however, since the Watchtower, along with such cautionary information,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:52.620
there were other statements published that imply that such realization of hopes

00:13:53.820 --> 00:14:00.940
by that year, 1975, was more of a probability than a mere possibility.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:08.700
It is to be regretted amidst the Watchtower. It is to be regretted that these latter statements

00:14:08.779 --> 00:14:16.299
apparently overshadowed the cautionary ones and contribute to a build-up of the expectation

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:27.259
already initiated. In its issue of July 15, 1976, the Watchtower commenting on the inadvisability

00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:34.059
of sitting outside some a certain date stated. If anyone has been disappointed through not

00:14:34.059 --> 00:14:39.259
following this line of thought, he should now concentrate on adjusting his viewpoints,

00:14:39.259 --> 00:14:47.019
seeing that it was not the word of God that failed or deceived him and brought disappointment,

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:54.220
but that his own understanding was based on wrong premises. In saying anyone, the Watchtower

00:14:54.220 --> 00:15:01.740
included all disappointed ones of Jehovah's Witnesses, hence including persons having to do with

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:09.899
the publication of the information that contributed to the build-up of hopes centered on that date,

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:19.340
end of quote. So very humbly, the Watchtower admitted that June 15, 1976.

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:23.340
Nevertheless, there is no reason for us to be shaken in the faith,

00:15:24.059 --> 00:15:30.860
God's promises. Rather as a consequence, we are all moved to make a closer examination of the

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:37.100
Scriptures regarding this matter of the day of judgment. In doing so, we find that the important

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:45.580
thing is not the date. What is important is our keeping every in mind that there is such a day,

00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:51.820
and it's getting close and it will require an accounting on the part of all of us. Peter said

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:58.139
that Christians should rightly be awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of

00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:07.179
Jehovah. There's a good reason to remain in expectation. Jesus told us to do so. In this regard,

00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:14.460
Jehovah's Organization has sent an example. Although sometimes promoting wrong expectations,

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:20.940
our publications have consistently exalted us to wait and keep close in mind the presence of the day

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:30.299
of Jehovah and to fix our hope in God's promised new world. Since keeping in expectation was

00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:36.700
appropriate for Christians living centuries ago, it is particularly important for us. Why?

00:16:37.899 --> 00:16:43.899
Because we are living during Christ's presence, the sign of His presence has been in evidence since

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:51.179
1914, and the multi-featured sign, which includes worsening world conditions and global kingdom

00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:58.779
preaching, is proof that we are living in the conclusion of the system of things. Since Jesus did not

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:07.500
say how long that period of time would go or go on before the final end arrived, we need to be

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:13.980
especially vigilant, watchful. There's no doubt that world conditions are deteriorating,

00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:21.259
but how bad do you expect conditions to become before the Great Tribulation? Jesus said that

00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:27.740
most people would take no note of His presence, carrying on with life's normal activities

00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:35.180
until it is too late. Thus, the Scriptures indicate that world conditions during the last days

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:42.380
would not become so extreme that people would be forced to believe that the end is near.

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:50.940
On the other hand, for the composite sign to serve its purpose, the fulfillment of it would have

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:58.140
to be obviously enough to command the attention of those who have been obeying Jesus' counsel to

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:06.619
keep on the watch, and that has been the case since 1914. From that time onward, the features of

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:14.940
the sign have been undergoing fulfillment. Clearly, we are now living in the time of the conclusion

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:22.940
of the system of things. Why then should Christians today keep in orientation or expectation

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:33.339
out of obedience to Jesus Christ, out of love for Him, out of faith in His promises?

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:43.019
We recognize the sign of His presence. Our expectations are based not on naive readiness

00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:50.380
to believe anything, but on solid, scriptural evidence that compels us to remain vigilant,

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.900
awake, watchful, and, yes, in expectation of the end of this wicked system.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:05.259
Many of us have been keeping awake spiritually already for decades. However, let us not allow

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:13.180
the passing of time to weaken our resolve to keep in expectation. We need to be ready for

00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:21.740
Jesus' arrival as executioner to end this system of things. Remember that Jesus exhorted His

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:28.140
followers in accordance with the prophecy in Mark 13, starting with verse 33.

00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:35.660
Keep looking, keep awake, for you do not know when the appointed time is. It is like a man

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.339
traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves to each one his work,

00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:47.180
and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch. Keep on the watch, therefore, for you do not know

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:55.180
when the master of the house is coming, whether late in the day or at midnight, or a dawn or early

00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:01.740
in the morning, in order that when he comes suddenly he does not find you sleeping. But what I say

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:10.220
to you, I say to all, keep on the watch. Upon recognizing that Christ's presence began in

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:18.140
1914, Jesus' followers rightly prepared for a possible early arrival of the end, that it so

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:25.500
by intensifying their kingdom preaching work. Jesus indicated that he might come later at dawn or

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:33.660
early in the morning, he said, if that happened, how were his followers to respond? He said, keep

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:40.940
on the watch. So a long wait would not justify mentally postponing the end or totally dismissing

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:49.579
their expectations. Consider the prophet Habakkuk, who was commissioned to foretell the destruction

00:20:49.579 --> 00:20:57.339
of Jerusalem. Jehovah assured his faithful prophet that the foretell destruction would not be

00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:07.579
late. He said, keep in expectation, Habakkuk chapter 1 and also chapter 2 verse 3.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.859
So don't you get discouraged by the fact that you have been preaching for a long time, perhaps

00:21:14.859 --> 00:21:22.460
decades. In the new world, all will have reason to reflect on the fact that all the foretold

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:28.380
events associated with the conclusion of the system of things are indeed taking place or have

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:36.059
taken place. Meditating on how matters actually turned out will further strengthen our confidence

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:43.259
in Jehovah and his promises to be fulfilled. We will surely be thankful to a God who has placed

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:49.579
times and seasons in his own jurisdiction. He exalted us to live within awareness that the end of

00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:56.299
all things has drawn close. The Bible predicts that political powers will turn against false

00:21:56.299 --> 00:22:03.019
religion. We should not assume that much time is needed for the state of this world to develop

00:22:03.019 --> 00:22:10.859
to the point where political powers, according to Revelation 17, 16 turn on world, the world

00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:19.420
Empire false religion. It says there in Revelation 17 and the 10 horns that you saw and the political

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:26.140
wild beast. These will hate the prostitute false religion and will make her devastated and

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:33.980
naked and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire. Let us bear in mind that

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:40.059
God will put it into their hearts to make that move and this could happen swiftly and at any time.

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:46.220
The end of this entire system of things is not far off. With good reason we should eat Jesus

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:52.539
morning. Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become way down with overeating

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:58.940
and heavy drinking or anxieties of life and suddenly let they be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:06.859
Let us be resolved to serve Jehovah with a sense of urgency, confident that he acts in behalf of

00:23:06.859 --> 00:23:13.420
those who keep in expectation of him. As we await the end of the present wicked system of

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:21.180
things, let us hear the Disappointed Jude's inspired words to 2021, beloved ones, build yourselves up

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.660
on your most holy faith and pray with Holy Spirit in order to keep yourselves in God's love

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:35.019
while you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view. By doing so,

00:23:35.099 --> 00:23:41.819
you Giliate students and each one of us here will prove ourselves ready. Yes, all this prepared

00:23:41.819 --> 00:23:49.980
for the good work the Christ will do, but also for every good work that we strive to do on a daily

00:23:49.980 --> 00:24:01.809
basis. Well, now we have the highlight of the program. We'll have the presentation of the diplomas

00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:06.849
and to help me with this, actually I think he has the hardest job here today,

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:14.130
is Brother William Malinfond, a helper to the teaching committee. He has the task of getting

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:25.839

Well, would you like to see now the graduates of the 147th class of Gilead?

00:30:57.359 --> 00:31:01.440
Well, now Brother Sukerman Kostermans is going to read the class letter.

00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:18.140
To the governing body and the Bethel family, dear brothers. Upon receiving our invitation to attend

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:26.299
Gilead, our hearts were filled with gratitude for Jehovah. Today, Mark's attorney point in our

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:33.259
lives, and we would like to thank the governing body for this opportunity to be taught and molded

00:31:33.259 --> 00:31:40.859
by our grand instructor Jehovah God. Your fine example of love and personal interest has touched us.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:47.900
In spite of your busy schedule, you personally came to teachers and helped us better understand

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:54.940
the mind of Christ. As we reflect on how Jehovah has bestowed upon us a blessing without measure,

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:01.660
we share the sentiments of the Psalmist in Psalm 116, verse 12 and 14, who sang,

00:32:02.779 --> 00:32:10.619
with what will I repay Jehovah for all the good he has done for me? I will pay my vows to Jehovah

00:32:10.619 --> 00:32:18.460
in the presence of all his people. We are determined to pay our vows by using the special training

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:23.339
to serve the interests of his organization, to his praise and honor.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:32.059
We are very thankful for the way the Bethel family welcomed us. In all the complexes, the hospitality

00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:39.180
shown was much more than we could have imagined. The majority of the class are Bethelites,

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:44.940
and to a certain degree we understand how much work time and effort is needed to display

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:51.259
hospitality. You are very attentive to us. You could read the question marks on our foreheads

00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:58.299
when we got lost. You are patiently standing in line behind us in the dining room when we saw

00:32:58.299 --> 00:33:08.559
certain foods for the first time. What can we say? We feel part of your family. Additionally,

00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:13.279
we have seen such wisdom and love through the gifts and man who have been used as instructors.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:19.119
You, brothers, have generously given of yourselves both heart and mind.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.799
By means of your teaching and experiences, you have helped us to isolate and apply Bible principles,

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:35.119
to be people-oriented, to deal with and see others as Christ did. It has helped us cultivate

00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:42.640
essential qualities that have changed the fabric of who we are inside. You never drew attention

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:50.079
to yourselves, but in all the lessons we truly appreciate how you glorified and magnified Jehovah.

00:33:51.839 --> 00:34:00.160
As Proverbs 10-22 says, it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich. We have been enriched

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:08.000
by making new lifelong friends, but Gilear training does not end here. As we depart for our various

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.960
assignments around the world, our determination is to stick ever closer to Jehovah and the work

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:21.280
he has assigned to us. Our resolve is to use our training to stabilize and strengthen

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:28.480
our brothers and to bring glory and honor to our grand instructor, Jehovah. We wish to convey

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:36.000
our gratitude and love to all of you. Your brothers and sisters, 147th class of Gilear.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:59.469
Well, at the beginning of this graduation program, I posed a question to all of you,

00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:10.510
and that question was, how far will you go? Well, in order to fully serve our brothers and sisters,

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:20.750
to love them, to train them, to help them, you will have to make major sacrifices in your life.

00:35:21.469 --> 00:35:26.829
Some of you are making them right now in order to accept some of the assignments that you

00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:32.030
received today. But I wanted to share with you a Bible account that I'd like for you to try to

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:37.789
keep in your minds, because you never know when the phone is going to ring or that email is going to

00:35:37.789 --> 00:35:49.179
come. Let's go to 2 Chronicles, chapter 25, and here we read about King Amazaya. It's very

00:35:49.179 --> 00:35:56.619
interesting what the Bible says here. Now, it mentions that in verse 6 of 2 Chronicles 25,

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:04.460
that Amazaya hired from Israel a hundred thousand mighty warriors for one hundred silver talents.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:14.300
Now, I didn't do all the math. Sorry, brother, explain. But I understand that this is well,

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:22.059
well, over one million dollars in today's money. So this is a very, very large sum that Amazaya had

00:36:22.059 --> 00:36:30.300
paid. But after he had done so, look at verse 7, but a man of the true God came to him saying,

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:39.099
okay, do not let the army of Israel go with you. For Jehovah is not with Israel, not with any of

00:36:39.179 --> 00:36:48.860
the Ephraimites, but go by yourself and be courageous in battle. Otherwise, the true God could

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:55.820
cause you to stumble before an enemy. For God has the power to help and to cause stumbling.

00:36:57.019 --> 00:37:03.500
Well, how did Amazaya react to that counsel? You see, right away in verse 9,

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:10.300
what Amazaya says to the man of the true God, but what about the one hundred talents that I've given

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:19.739
to the troops of Israel, right? He had already paid the money. When how could we apply that principle

00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:28.940
to you? Well, many of you may have made major sacrifices already in your career full-time service.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:34.699
Maybe you've had to learn a new language. Maybe you've made an investment of time in your

00:37:34.699 --> 00:37:41.659
department at Bethel or in your field assignment. And now you're being asked to do something different.

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:47.900
Perhaps learn a whole new language or go from field to the field to Bethel or from the Bethel

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:55.980
to the field. Well, will you feel like Amazaya? Will you say what about those one hundred talents

00:37:56.699 --> 00:38:03.099
that I've already paid? Well, here's the answer that I'd like for you to keep in your mind.

00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:09.900
You see, the man of the true God in verse 9 answered Amazaya, and this is what he said,

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:18.780
Jehovah has the means to give you much more than that. And that's the thought you want to

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:26.539
treasure in your mind and heart when you're asked to take up some new challenge, some new assignment.

00:38:26.539 --> 00:38:33.340
And it may mean walking away from a large investment that you have already made. Remember,

00:38:34.059 --> 00:38:41.500
Jehovah has the power to give you much more than that. Well, with those thoughts in mind,

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:51.019
may you go with all of our love, with our deep respect, and with the blessing of our wonderful

00:38:51.019 --> 00:39:00.539
our amazing God, Jehovah.
