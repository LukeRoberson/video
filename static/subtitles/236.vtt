00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.820
Welcome to this special news update.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:14.099
As reported in the newsroom section of JW.org, on November 30, 2018, the South Korean government

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.019
released 57 of our brothers who had been in prison for conscientious objection.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.300
The governing body, together with our worldwide brotherhood, rejoices with these brothers

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.899
and their families.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.859
The Ministry of Justice granted an early release for our brothers who had already served

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.340
at least six months of their 18-month sentence.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.460
We expect that the remaining eight brothers will also be released sometime after they've

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.979
served six months of their sentence.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:53.060
They will be the last of the more than 19,000 witnesses who have been sent to prison in

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.299
Korea since 1953.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.140
But what led to this momentous event?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.180
During 2018, a series of historic court rulings in Korea finally recognized conscientious

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.700
objection as a fundamental right.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.379
This development now puts South Korea in line with many other countries in the world

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:25.939
who say that refraining from military service for religious reasons is not a crime.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:46.340
As a result of these rulings, the prison doors were opened for 57 brothers.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.219
Recently, our branch received a report from the elders appointed to assist our imprisoned

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.219
brothers.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.540
They said that brothers who have served at least six months of their sentence could be released

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.900
early on parole.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.140
It was such great news that I almost couldn't believe it.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.379
My son will be released two months earlier than expected.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:14.460
I've heard that two months in prison feels very long, will even a single day feels long.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.780
Since our brothers in the past had been allowed parole after serving at least 14 months,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.139
this was a great surprise to our brothers and many were beside themselves with joy.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.939
It's been over a year since I've been able to hug my son.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.860
And I meet him tomorrow.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.539
The first thing I want to do is give him a warm hug and tell him he did a good job staying

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.539
strong in prison.

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:49.780
My son was a caregiver for ill inmates, which can be dangerous because of bloodborne diseases.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.259
So he'd always show me he had no open wounds on his hands and feet.

00:02:54.259 --> 00:03:17.219
Tomorrow I'll be able to hold those hands and I don't plan on letting go.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:22.699
Finally, 57 brothers were released at the same time from 16 different prisons throughout

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:23.699
South Korea.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:32.509
It's an amazing development.

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:39.509
The Supreme Court's not guilty decision last month was pivotal in our brother's early release.

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:44.349
It stated that those who object to military service based on a conviction that his deep,

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.750
firm and genuine should be protected.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.469
Many developments in the past few years led up to this wonderful outcome.

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:59.310
For example, since 2007, the governing body provided assistance and encouragement to our

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.389
brothers to make a fine defense in court.

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:09.990
As a result, more than 120 not guilty decisions were rendered at the lower courts.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.270
The constitutional court which had deliberated on this issue for many years rendered a historic

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:22.519
decision declaring that the absence of alternative service is unconstitutional.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:28.319
Furthermore, international human rights organizations recommended the releasing of conscientious

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:32.259
objectors.

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.819
Also our brothers worldwide have prayed incessantly for our imprisoned brothers.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:44.350
We believe these were an important factor that brought about this great change.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.910
They also sent many letters of encouragement for our brothers to the branch.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.370
And every one of these were forwarded to them.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.329
There is no doubt these helped our brothers to endure.

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:07.139
Now our brothers who were separated from their families for many months have been reunited.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.899
I've been looking forward to this day so much and I'm so happy to be with my family again.

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:21.540
Thanks to Jehovah's protection, we're able to have our son back in our arms in good health.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.740
We welcome this decision and are overjoyed at the early release of our brothers.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.339
We look forward to seeing our brothers using their freedom to bring praise to Jehovah.

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:37.060
He has brought salvation and shown favor to our brothers walking the path of integrity

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.660
for the past 65 years.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.420
We are grateful for Jehovah's loving care.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.319
This Peter chapter 2 verse 19 states, it is agreeable when someone endures hardship and

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:56.740
suffers unjustly because of conscience toward God.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.540
This strongly applies to you brothers in career.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.779
Through your long legacy of faith and endurance, you have set a stunning example of integrity

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.980
and given a powerful witness.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.379
As a result, you have Jehovah's smile of approval.

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:20.620
Our thanks go to your families and all those around the world who have kept you in their

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.100
prayers.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.139
The words of Romans 10-11 echo a fundamental truth about Jehovah.

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.459
No one who rests his faith on him will be disappointed.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:36.660
Yes, all praise and honor go to Jehovah.
