00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:20.850
Oh, it's Sparlock! Caleb!

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.370
We need someone to save us!

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.649
Caleb!

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.730
Activate the Magic Sparlock!

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.289
Hi! How was school today?

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.649
Fine. Look at Sparlock's Magic Caleb!

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.170
What? Toy is that?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.329
It's Sparlock! The Warrior Wizard!

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.130
Whoa! A Warrior Wizard!

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.729
Yeah, my friend gave it to me.

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.689
All the kids are going to see the movie. Can I see you too?

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:46.049
Oh, your friend gave this to you.

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.049
Hmm. You look pretty excited about this.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:59.179
Why don't you come over here and get your snack, okay?

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.340
Is this toy magical?

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.579
Mm-hmm. Caleb, who likes magic?

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.780
Jehovah or Satan?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.379
Satan.

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:15.900
Right. Magic is bad. That's why Jehovah hates it.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.459
Do you really want to play with something

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:28.189
that Jehovah hates? Do you remember who we learned about at Family Worship?

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.590
Who is this? Ed Meneef.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.150
Right. Did they obey Jehovah?

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.629
No, they disobey Jehovah. And he got very sad.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:44.689
So what if you disobey Jehovah and play with toys he doesn't like?

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.650
Do you think Jehovah will be happy?

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.680
We're sad. Sad? Yeah.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.000
Do you want Jehovah to be sad?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
No. I don't want Jehovah to be sad with me.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.319
No, I don't want Jehovah to be sad with you either.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.039
So what do you think you should do with this toy?

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:19.889
Caleb, I am so proud of you.

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:24.289
You made mommy very happy. And you know who else is happy?

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:32.349
Jehovah. Yes. Jehovah loves you very much for obeying him, Caleb.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.110
You know what I want to do?

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.150
What? I want to go ride bikes.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.750
Yay! Let's go!
