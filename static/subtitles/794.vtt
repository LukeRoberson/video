WEBVTT

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.010
Welcome to the Inside Story.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.009
In the Book of Acts, chapter 1, verse 8,

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.009
Jesus said to His disciples that they would be witnesses of Him

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.009
to the most distant part of the earth.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.009
And today, we are going to meet guests

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:45.009
from the 157th class who are serving in distant parts of the earth.

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.009
So let's meet our first guest, Brother Fernando Samal from Brazil.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.540
Welcome, Fernando.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.540
Thank you.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.540
It's good to have you on the Inside Story.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.540
You come from Brazil.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.540
You're serving at the branch there in Sao Paulo.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.540
Yes.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.540
But I know there is a place in Brazil that is very close to your heart.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.540
Yes.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540
I love the Amazon region.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540
So what is it about the Amazon region, Fernando?

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.540
Maybe two words, the people.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.540
Nice.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.540
They are amazing.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.540
I'm interested.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.540
What is it about the people there?

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.540
They really accept the truth.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.540
They have a good inclination to serve Jehovah

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.540
or to hear about God.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.540
And it's amazing because we are able to preach to them all the time.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
So what is it like to actually preach to them?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.540
What's it like to converse with them?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.540
We can talk about many different matters.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.540
But since they live in the middle of the jungle,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.540
the middle of the creation that Jehovah made to us,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.539
we can use that to help them.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.539
And of course, they face some challenges that the new world will solve.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:19.539
And this can be the matter that we talk with them.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.539
Nice.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:25.539
Now, how is it that you first visited the Amazon?

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.539
I've been there many years ago.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:34.539
We received in our house one brother that went to MTS in Sao Paulo.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:39.539
And he was serving that time in About over there.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.539
And he invited us to visit.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:47.539
And I went there with my two flesh brothers for the first time.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:48.539
Nice.

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:53.539
So he started the fire in you for the Amazon region.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:57.539
Have they had preaching campaigns in the region?

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:58.539
Yes.

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:03.539
They made this a few years ago, a big campaign.

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.539
With a lot of good results.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.539
We saw the increase over there.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.539
Many people are coming to the truth.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.539
New congregations, new circuits.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:18.539
And many brothers are supporting the work over there.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.539
You mentioned that something that really touched you

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:25.539
about the brothers who participated in the preaching campaigns.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.539
Can you tell us about that?

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.539
A few of them decided to stay.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.539
They went just to support for maybe one week, two weeks.

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.539
But then they noticed the need.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.539
And they decided to stay.

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:43.539
They moved to over there.

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.539
They are serving and taking the lead in the congregation.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.539
For me, this is amazing.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.539
I know in Brazil you have some SKE schools.

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:56.539
How is SKE been used to support the work in the Amazon region?

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:00.539
They are saving in the last years.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.539
Many brothers to serve over there.

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:08.539
After the school, they are assigned to those congregations

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.539
that they need help.

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:15.539
And it's been amazing gift from Jehovah, actually,

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:19.540
to help the growing over there.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.540
Very nice.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.540
Now, the Brazil branch and audio video services

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.540
have prepared a video about preaching in the Amazon region.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.540
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what it's like there

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.540
and why it's so special to you.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.540
So let's enjoy it together.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.610
Let's see.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.610
Brazil is vast.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.610
It is the largest country in South America

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.610
and the fifth largest in the world.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.610
It contains a wide range of landscapes,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.610
including wetlands, savannas, mountains, and rainforests.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.610
It is home to the largest river system in the world,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.610
the mighty Amazon.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.610
We have about 920,000 publishers in Brazil.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.610
New congregations and new circuits are being formed every year

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.610
with approximately 25,000 people getting baptized each year.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.610
Yes, Brazil is on fire.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.610
However, there is too much work to be done.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.610
Did you know there are more than 28 million people

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.610
living in the Amazon region of Brazil

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.610
and hundreds of indigenous languages are spoken.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.610
An incredible help has been the school for Kingdom evangelizers.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.610
Here in Brazil, we have two educational centers for SKE,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.610
as well as some satellite locations.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.610
In the past two years alone, 54 classes have been held.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.610
The school is very focused on the Amazon region

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.610
because there's such a need there.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.610
In fact, a quarter of all graduates from Brazil go to that area.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.610
But once the graduates arrive, they are not left on their own.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.920
The local brothers teach them things like,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.920
what to say or not say, how to act in certain situations.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.920
The teachers are the local brothers.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.920
The dynamics of preaching in the Amazon region

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.920
involves traveling great distances.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.920
I remember during our first visits into the interior,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.920
the local brothers would say,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.920
brother, you need more time here for us to go into the interior.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.920
And I thought, I'm already in the interior.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.920
Then we discover that there is an interior of the interior

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.920
that involves even more days of travel and longer boat trips.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.920
We graduated from SKE on October 6, 2024.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.920
And we were assigned to the Amazonist region.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.920
This made us a bit anxious at first

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.920
because we had no idea what that area would be like

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.920
or if we would find work or not.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.709
Honestly, we expected it to be more difficult.

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:28.709
But it was completely the opposite.

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:30.709
We're doing really well here.

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:37.370
This assignment has been a true gift for us.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.970
Field service in the Amazon is great.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.970
People are so receptive.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.970
As you can see, Brazil is a big country

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.970
with a big heart to go with it.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.730
Jehovah is indeed blessing our hard-working brothers and sisters

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.730
as they joyfully share in reaching those

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:42.409
in the remote areas of Brazil.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.409
That is amazing Fernando.

00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:46.409
Really, really impressive.

00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:49.409
The work that's going on there in that region.

00:08:49.409 --> 00:08:50.409
Yeah.

00:08:50.409 --> 00:08:54.409
May I ask you, what has been your longest trip to the Amazon region?

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:58.409
I've been there for more than 20 days.

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:01.409
20-25 days around of that.

00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:02.409
Good.

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:04.409
How long did it take you to get there?

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:08.409
Sometimes more than one day by boat.

00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:11.409
This is what it calls low boat.

00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:16.409
We have fast boats, airplane, but it's nice.

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:17.409
You can enjoy the trip.

00:09:17.409 --> 00:09:20.409
It's beautiful, amazing river.

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:23.409
Whatever way you go to be able to preach the word.

00:09:23.409 --> 00:09:24.409
Yes.

00:09:24.409 --> 00:09:25.409
It's a great place.

00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:26.409
Thank you very much Fernando.

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:30.409
Thanks for sharing your special place with us here on the Inside Story.

00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:31.409
A pleasure.

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:33.409
Let's meet our next guests.

00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:36.409
It's Carla and Judah Kern from Central America.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:53.000
Carla and Judah, nice to have you.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
You're on the Inside Story.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
You're both serving presently in Mexico at the Central America branch.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
How long have you been in Mexico?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Seven years now, not too long.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We were serving in Honduras in the field before that.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I know you come from Canada, but how did you get to Honduras?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
My parents.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Growing up, Mom and Dad were always looking for where to serve,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
where he was great.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
We moved a lot when I was a kid.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I have a brother and a sister.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Our family of five was constantly on the move.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
When I was 15, Mom and Dad told us we're thinking,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
next move, Honduras.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
We thought, okay, sounds fun.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Literally, we just packed our car.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Everything we could inside our car on top of our car,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
said goodbye to our family in Canada,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and drove from Canada to Honduras.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
As a kid, a 15-year-old, Honduras became home.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
The ministry became my life.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I started pioneering soon after we got there.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I got appointed as a special pioneer,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
so that was really nice to be assigned to isolated areas of the country

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
as well.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I got to serve on an island called Guanajá,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
in the mosquito coast.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Beautiful experiences throughout the country.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Very nice.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Now, I know you told me your Dad's a planner,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
so maybe to a 15-year-old felt like you just packed the car and left.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
He probably did more than that, but it seemed like that.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
What about you, Carla?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
How did you get to Honduras?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Well, I was born in Ireland,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and my parents are from England.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
They were both intrepid.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
When they were younger, they moved to Ireland,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
so where the name was greater.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
They met there, got married, started special pioneering together.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And when my brother and I came along,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
they carried on special pioneering together with us.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So we were raised in the ministry.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
They really loved it, and they helped us to love it as well.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So when I moved away from home after I finished school,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I started pioneering.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Yeah, I just carried on enjoying the ministry.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
But around that time, there was a lot of my friends were reaching out

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
to serve with and he was greater abroad.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So that was something I didn't always became a good goal for me as well,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
to expand my ministry.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So one day a friend invited me.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
She sent me a message.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
She said, there's a chance for us to go to Honduras together.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
It's a small island called Guanajá,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
in the middle of the Caribbean.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It's like, why not?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
It doesn't sound like something you should turn down.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But at the time, I had no money.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I had nothing in the bank.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I was filling my car up with two dollars worth of petrol at a time.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I'm not going very far.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And just at that time, within the half hour of her message,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
my work offered me a full-time position for a couple of months.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So I said, yes.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So Jehovah gave me a way to go to Honduras.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
So I went after three months of working.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And I arrived in a very small little island in the middle of the Caribbean

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and a special pioneer who had red hair picked me up in a boat.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And that's what I'm saying.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
We were married within the year.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You said, due to that, it became home for you.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Is there anything specific about Honduras or Central America,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Mexico that made it feel like home?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Like Fernando said, the people.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And when my family arrived to Honduras, we saw it right away.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Like I mentioned, we drove to Honduras.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So seven days, family of five, sitting together,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
you can imagine what that journey would have been like.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But arriving in the country, you arrived in the middle of a hurricane,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
which we didn't know when we left Canada.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So day seven coming into Honduras, hurricane Mitch, we caught.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And we were driving through the country in the pouring rain

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and got to a little town where we got stuck.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
There was no going forward.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
The road was blocked by water.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
We went back.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
They had closed the bridge already.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So I couldn't speak the language.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I was stuck in a little town.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I couldn't.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So dad just rolled the window down and said all he could in Spanish.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Testigo, stay.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Heo va.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Something like that in this broken Spanish.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
He spoke better Spanish after that.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And sure enough, the man who was there pointed.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
There was a sister just there, one of the, I think,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
seven publishers in that town at the time.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So they took us in.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
They were in the middle of a hurricane suffering.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And they were happy to have us.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
They were feeding us fried chicken.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
One of the sisters had a little restaurant there.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
We were excited about that.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So for a few days, we were stuck in this town.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
But what a welcome we got in their homes.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And that's how it was everywhere we went.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Just into people's homes.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
They loved to have us.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
It was such a warm family.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Warm welcome and hospitality.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
How would you describe the hospitality, Carla?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Yeah, I would say that's straight away you're in,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
you're in with them.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
What do you mean by that?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
As in, there's no breaking the ice phase.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
There's no warming up to you phase.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
It's like straight away as soon as you arrive in the congregation,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
you're in with them.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So you're passing by their house, for example,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and you're thirsty, you're hot.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
They invite you in.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
They sit you in front of a fan.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
They give you water.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
You need an app.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
They have a bed.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
They have a hammock.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
They have a porch if you want a porch.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So their hospitality is never just on their terms.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
It's to meet the needs that you have.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So whatever need you had at that time,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
they were just willing to fill it.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Nice.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
They came pick up you in the airport to feed it.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
This is very nice.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I learned it quickly.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Judah, for you, as a young single special pioneer,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
did you enjoy the hospitality?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I did, and I have to say that it was kind of embarrassing

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
the hospitality I was shown so much

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
so that I pretty much never cooked.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So...

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
He still doesn't.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And that's why I never got to learn how to cook.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
There were just two hospitable assignments that I was...

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Very, very nice.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Yeah, that just makes it home going to a distant land

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and to be so warmly welcomed.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
In fact, there was an expression they would use

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
when they would invite me over.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
They'll say, just come on in.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
We'll add more water to the soup.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
So that was the expression,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
no matter what they were eating,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
it was a figurative expression, but it was beautiful.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Do you have an expression like that in Portuguese?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Yes, we add water to the beans.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Yeah, with the same idea.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Same idea.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Yes, nice.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
What about the ministry, though?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
What does it like to preach in the areas where you've served?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
In Central America and in Honduras,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
where we were just such a respect for the Bible,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
so so easy to start conversations.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And that meant getting to know our Bibles.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I remember when we got there,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I'd not use the Bible much in the ministry,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
maybe a verse I'd memorize,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
but then I'd be going in service with families that had kids,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
maybe 10 years old,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
that knew all these scriptures, different ones they were reading.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And I'm like, how do they know so many verses in the Bible?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
But then just going more in service,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I realized it's because everybody wants to hear the Bible.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
So that was really nice getting to know the Scriptures.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
What about for you, Carla?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
So coming from Ireland to Honduras,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
was there much of a learning curve for you?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Yeah, the same as Judah,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
just getting to know your Bible.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So maybe you're used to using just one or two Scriptures at a door.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
You had your favorites,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
but there you could just like use the whole range of the Bible.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
So that was really nice getting to know the Bible better.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Also getting to know the publications,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
because there's so many opportunities to conduct Bible studies,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
so you really got familiar with them and the publications.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And also, something I really appreciated was,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
you'd arrive at their house.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
They weren't expecting you,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
but they sat you down,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
they got their Bible out.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And as you were speaking, they would take notes and lines.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
So seeing their appreciation for the Bible really helps,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
kind of like cement it down for you,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
as well just how amazing the Bible is.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Oh, what a beautiful experience, so nice.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
The branch in Central America,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
along with the AVS, has prepared a nice video

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
for us to be able to see some of these areas

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and perhaps some of this hospitality

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and looking forward to seeing it with you.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.309
Me too.

00:18:33.309 --> 00:18:36.309
Central America is a large region of land,

00:18:36.309 --> 00:18:39.309
that includes the countries of Panama,

00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:41.309
Costa Rica,

00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:43.309
Nicaragua,

00:18:43.309 --> 00:18:45.309
Honduras,

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:47.309
El Salvador,

00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:49.309
Guatemala,

00:18:49.309 --> 00:18:51.309
and Belize.

00:18:51.309 --> 00:18:55.309
It extends in an arc roughly 1800 kilometers

00:18:55.309 --> 00:18:59.309
or 1,100 miles in length from the northwest to the southeast.

00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:02.309
And no matter where you live in Central America,

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:04.309
there were never more than 200 kilometers

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:07.309
or 125 miles away from the sea.

00:19:07.309 --> 00:19:09.309
By September 2012,

00:19:09.309 --> 00:19:11.309
the preaching work in Costa Rica,

00:19:11.309 --> 00:19:12.309
El Salvador,

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:13.309
Guatemala,

00:19:13.309 --> 00:19:14.309
Honduras,

00:19:14.309 --> 00:19:15.309
Nicaragua, and Panama

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:17.309
all came under the supervision

00:19:17.309 --> 00:19:20.309
of the Central America branch in Mexico.

00:19:20.309 --> 00:19:23.309
What efforts are being made to reach honest hearted ones

00:19:23.309 --> 00:19:27.309
in some of the diverse areas of Central America?

00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:29.309
It has truly been a beautiful experience

00:19:29.309 --> 00:19:31.309
to be here in El Salvador.

00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:35.309
The training that we received

00:19:35.309 --> 00:19:37.309
at the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:39.309
has been so helpful

00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:42.309
because it taught us that beyond delivering a message,

00:19:42.309 --> 00:19:44.309
it is important to have empathy

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:47.309
and really listen and understand people.

00:19:47.309 --> 00:19:52.930
Well, people here are quite religious

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.930
and devoted to their faith.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.930
I try to demonstrate Christian qualities,

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.930
like those we're learning

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.930
in the love people make disciples brochure.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:05.740
Today, we observe people

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.740
and listen to what they want to express.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.740
We wait for the right moment to preach to them.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.740
That indicates that Jehovah

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.740
is blessing the efforts

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.740
we make to find the deserving ones.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.740
Here in La Seiva,

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.740
we preach in different languages,

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.740
for example, sign language,

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.740
mosquito,

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.740
garifuna, and Spanish.

00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:29.279
Jehovah has really blessed

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:31.279
the efforts of the publishers here.

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:33.279
The local people are amazed

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:36.279
when one greets them in their language.

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:45.180
And that is something that has been very positive.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.180
We also have the use of JW.org

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.180
and their face is shine

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.180
when they are shown a video in their language.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.180
They are completely amazed and very happy

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:02.740
that we have made videos in their language.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.740
We have seen Jehovah's blessing in the territory

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.740
and also the support from our brothers.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.740
Feeling like we have many partners to preach with

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.740
to make return visits

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.740
and conduct Bible studies.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.740
This makes the ministry even more enjoyable.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.740
Mexico City is one of the largest cities in the world.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.740
Just the main city

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.740
has a population of over 9 million.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.740
Many languages are spoken.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:35.740
Not just the main languages like English, Spanish, French,

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.740
but also indigenous languages.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.740
The number of languages

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.740
presents a big challenge

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.740
because how do we reach all those people?

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.740
Well, one thing that has really helped

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.740
is public witnessing.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.740
We have, for example,

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.740
over 24 locations

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.740
for special metropolitan witnessing

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.740
just in Mexico City.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.740
So that opens up a big opportunity

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.740
to reach people in their native language.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.740
So recently two groups were formed in Haitian Creole.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.740
It's beautiful, the welcome people

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.740
who speak another language

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.740
and be able to learn it

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.740
to transmit Jehovah's message in that language.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.740
As you can see,

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.740
Central America's diversity is also its beauty.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.740
Jehovah's people are reflecting like mirrors his great love

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.740
in reaching out to people

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.740
of all nationalities, tongues, and backgrounds.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:37.529
Remarkable.

00:22:37.529 --> 00:22:38.529
Thank you so much for that.

00:22:38.529 --> 00:22:41.529
It's amazing to see the work that's just the variety

00:22:41.529 --> 00:22:43.529
of places and the work that's being done there.

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:45.529
I noticed there's a lot of water,

00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:47.529
a lot of water, a lot of beaches.

00:22:47.529 --> 00:22:49.529
Do you swim there?

00:22:49.529 --> 00:22:51.529
Yes, on the island where we were,

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:53.529
pretty much every week we would spend a nice day

00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:55.529
at the beach enjoying the water,

00:22:55.529 --> 00:22:56.529
snarkling.

00:22:56.529 --> 00:22:58.529
Crystal clear, beautiful.

00:22:58.529 --> 00:22:59.529
Miss it.

00:22:59.529 --> 00:23:00.529
Crystal clear.

00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:02.529
A lot of water in the Amazon region.

00:23:02.529 --> 00:23:03.529
Do you swim there?

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:05.529
Yes.

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:09.529
But it's not crystal and clear all the time.

00:23:10.529 --> 00:23:12.529
And sometimes we have crocodiles.

00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:14.529
And pinangas.

00:23:14.529 --> 00:23:18.529
We need to look.

00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:21.529
Yeah, what is possible to do that?

00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:23.529
But again,

00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:25.529
Judan, just a beautiful spirit.

00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:27.529
We see the brothers and sisters there in the hard work.

00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:28.529
Thank you very much.

00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:31.529
Thank you for letting us talk to you

00:23:31.529 --> 00:23:33.529
about the amazing preaching work there in Central America.

00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:34.529
Thank you.

00:23:34.529 --> 00:23:35.529
Thank you.

00:23:35.529 --> 00:23:36.529
Let's meet our next guests.

00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:40.529
It's Christian and Karina Zagetti from the Philippines.

00:23:40.529 --> 00:23:59.200
Christian and Karina, welcome.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.200
Thank you for being here with us on the Inside Story.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.200
So you both are serving in the Philippines at the Philippines branch,

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.200
but you're not from the Philippines, you're from Brazil.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.200
So how did you get from Brazil to the Philippines?

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.200
That's a good question.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.200
I'm asking myself how I ended up there.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:25.200
So actually we got transferred from Brazil branch to the Philippines branch

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.200
for a project for a computer department initially for two years.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.200
Initially, it's a long project.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.200
Yes.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.200
We've been there for almost 15 years now.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.200
Well, that's beautiful though.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.200
But how did it happen?

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.200
What was it that happened that got you to the Philippines?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.200
Yes, so we got an invitation.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.200
There were possibilities for us to serve in another branch.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.200
So I was serving as a single in Brazil for 12 years.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.200
And we got married.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.200
I was there.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.200
Fernando was there.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.200
Fernando was there.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.200
Yes.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200
He was in our wedding.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200
We got approved to stay in Beto.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.200
And then just a few months after we got married,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.200
we had this possibility to serve in another branch.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.200
But we consider, talk about it, pray about it.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.200
We've been up there time.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.200
You're in Beto.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.200
But you ended up in the Philippines.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.200
That just three months later, this next opportunity came.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.200
New invitation to go to the Philippines.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.200
So we realized you're over one in us to go to a foreign assignment.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.200
And we prayed about it and say yes.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.200
We didn't want to be like John and say no.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.200
So we're like, let's go.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.200
Well, John was a courageous prophet.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.200
And you're courageous.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.200
Jonah went to his assignment.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.200
And here you are in the Philippines.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:57.200
So a long way from home, what would you say that helped make the Philippines your home?

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.200
Definitely the brotherhood.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.200
Jehovah's organization, it's truly a big family.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.200
And being so far from home, we can feel the love from the brothers in the congregation

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.200
and in the Beto family.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.200
How they welcomed us.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.200
Always so concerned for our well-being.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.200
And also, they went always out of their way to care for us.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.200
So it was beautiful to see and that definitely made us feel home pretty quickly.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200
I'm sure it would.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.200
Can you think of an example, Christian, of how they did that for you?

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.200
Well, the brothers, they did so many things for us to feel at home.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:41.200
So I think one thing that touched our hearts was when we were still having the food arrangement in Beto

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.200
so we had to go down to the dining hall to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.200
So we had this single brother in our table, in the dining hall.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.200
And he was from one of the distant provinces in the country.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:02.200
And we were having a little bit of hard time to have fish and rice for breakfast.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.200
So we were still trying to have fish and rice.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.200
Yes, big eyes.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.200
With big eyes, with the tail, the whole fish there.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.200
But this brother, I think he was concerned about us.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.200
And he said, hey, what is your favorite food?

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.200
I didn't have anything to say at the moment.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.200
I just thought about maybe a hamburger with fries.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.200
I think that's my favorite food, I guess.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.200
So instead of fish and rice for breakfast, hamburger and fries for breakfast?

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.200
I would say for lunch and dinner.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:35.200
But then the next following day, right in front of our Beto room,

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.200
there was a package there and the brother gave it to us.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.200
And he was like concerned about our well-being.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.200
So it was amazing.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.200
It was just a little thing, but among so many others.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.200
It meant a lot.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.200
Yeah.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.200
Made for us.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.200
For us to feel at home, yeah.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.200
So in the package was a hamburger and fries.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.200
A hamburger.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.200
Amazing, happy.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.200
That's true.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.200
Well, it would make you feel at home.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.200
Yeah.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.200
That's absolutely beautiful.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200
And so you're serving at the branch.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.200
The branches in Manila.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.200
Manila is one of the most densely populated cities in the world.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.200
So what is preaching like in the city of Manila?

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.200
Yeah, that's true.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.200
It's one of the most densely populated cities in the world.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.200
There's a lot of people everywhere.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.200
But the good thing is that they are really...

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.200
It's not hard to talk to people about the truth or about the Bible,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.200
especially the Bible.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.200
Like Judamation and Fernandomation about these regions.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.200
So they have a real respect for the Bible.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.200
So we have all these arrangements in place,

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.200
like street witnessing, metropolitan witnessing,

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.200
cart witnessing.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.200
We have a variety of business territories to covert.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.200
And we also have mall witnessing.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.200
Mall witnessing.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.200
Mall witnessing is an interesting form of preaching.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.200
It's hard to not get distracted by the stores.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.200
And I love the coffee shops there.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.200
But it's interesting.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.200
You can still meet and talk to people in these areas.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.200
And they are fine if you approach them in the right moment,

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.200
the right time.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200
You mean in the coffee shop?

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.200
In the coffee shop.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.200
You can't be in the coffee shop.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.200
Now I see my Christian loves coffee so much.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.200
Yeah.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.200
I would like to try to find a shopping mall

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.200
in the middle of the Amazon rainforest.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200
With the coffee shop.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.200
With the coffee shop.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.200
Yeah, it would be nice.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.200
Again, the branch in the Philippines and AVS have prepared a video.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.200
We're looking forward to seeing what preaching is like in the Philippines,

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.200
particularly in the metropolitan and other areas.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.410
So let's look at it.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.410
The Philippines is an island country of Southeast Asia,

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.410
located in a Pacific Ocean.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.410
It consists of more than 7,000 islands and eyelids,

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:58.410
about 800 kilometers or 500 miles off the cost of Vietnam.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:02.410
Did you know that Philippines is the second most popular Asian country

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.410
with English as an official language following India?

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:12.410
The capital Manila is part of a greater metropolitan region known as

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.410
metropolitan Manila.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:19.410
Interestingly, well, this is the smallest region in the Philippines.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.410
It is also the most densely populated,

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:26.410
being home to over 13 million Filipinos.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:32.410
What is it like to preach in this densely populated area?

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:38.410
More than 10% of the publishers in the Philippines reside in Metro Manila.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.410
That is over 30,000 publishers.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:47.410
Interestingly, over 9,400 of them serve as regular pioneers.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.410
Metro Manila is a city of contrast.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:54.410
It has high buildings in its central business districts.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:59.410
It also has informal settlements in narrow streets and alleyways.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:05.410
A street of less than a kilometer can be home to hundreds of families.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.410
Some congregations in our circuit,

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:10.410
especially those that are in the metropolitan area,

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.410
are assigned to work on many apartment buildings.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:17.410
So the congregation body of elders have trained specific individuals

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:23.329
to be able to penetrate these areas effectively.

00:31:23.329 --> 00:31:26.329
As in Metro Manila are so densely populated,

00:31:26.329 --> 00:31:31.329
we don't always have accurate maps or specific addresses for everyone.

00:31:31.329 --> 00:31:39.329
So it can be a real challenge to determine whether these areas have been well covered or not.

00:31:39.329 --> 00:31:45.329
But thanks to good democratic training and useful online tools,

00:31:45.329 --> 00:31:48.329
these areas are getting mapped out.

00:31:48.329 --> 00:31:52.329
The Filipino Sign Language Territory is an interesting field in Metro Manila.

00:31:52.329 --> 00:31:55.329
Many brothers and sisters have learned the Sign Language

00:31:55.329 --> 00:32:00.329
in order to help the deaf ones learn the good news.

00:32:00.329 --> 00:32:06.329
We can see Jehovah's Blessing through the fulfillment of Haggai chapter 2 verse 7.

00:32:06.329 --> 00:32:11.329
It feels as though Jehovah is indeed shaking these territories

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:15.329
so that the precious ones, those rightly disposed hearts,

00:32:15.329 --> 00:32:18.329
will come to his organization and serve him.

00:32:18.329 --> 00:32:26.329
Personally, it's very encouraging to see how the brothers and sisters endure faithfully and joyfully.

00:32:26.329 --> 00:32:30.329
They endure not because they do not have a choice.

00:32:30.329 --> 00:32:36.329
They endure because they are happy, doing God's work and loving the people.

00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:42.329
Yes, as you can see, the Philippines is a preaching paradise.

00:32:43.329 --> 00:32:49.329
Jehovah is making sure that no one gets mis in this historic time of the end.

00:32:49.329 --> 00:33:06.579
Wow, there is so much being done and so much work to do.

00:33:06.579 --> 00:33:11.579
Let me ask you this though, the brother mentioned there are so many publishers in the Metro Manila era

00:33:11.579 --> 00:33:13.579
and a lot of regular pioneers.

00:33:13.579 --> 00:33:19.579
Even with so many publishers there, is there still a need?

00:33:19.579 --> 00:33:21.579
Yes, there is still a need.

00:33:21.579 --> 00:33:27.579
It's actually one of the regions in the country that there is a growth in publishers.

00:33:27.579 --> 00:33:34.579
As a matter of fact, nearly 20% of those who were baptized in the Philippines

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:39.579
were coming from this particular area in Manila region.

00:33:39.579 --> 00:33:42.579
So there is growth there for sure.

00:33:42.579 --> 00:33:44.579
Wow, interesting. Thank you so much.

00:33:44.579 --> 00:33:48.579
Christian Karina, thank you so much for being here and thank you for your self-sacrificing spirit

00:33:48.579 --> 00:33:53.579
in being in the Philippines, making it your home and supporting the work that's going on there.

00:33:53.579 --> 00:33:56.579
And we say thank you to all of you for being with us on the inside story

00:33:56.579 --> 00:34:01.579
and your self-sacrificing spirit to support the preaching work.

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:06.579
Jesus said, the fields are white for harvesting and what we've seen today indeed they are.

00:34:06.579 --> 00:34:11.579
And it's beautiful to see the spirit, the intrepid spirit of our brothers and sisters

00:34:11.579 --> 00:34:14.579
in preaching the good news of God's kingdom,

00:34:14.579 --> 00:34:19.579
and also to see the support of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:22.579
to help this work grow worldwide.

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:26.579
We look forward to seeing all of you on another edition of the Inside Story.
