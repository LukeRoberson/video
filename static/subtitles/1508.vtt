00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:15.269
When the Apostle Paul wrote to Christians and Ephesus about unity and the congregation,

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:27.390
he compared the Mosaic law to a wall that divided Jews and Gentiles.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.390
Paul may have been alluding to the wall that surrounded the inner courtyards of the first

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:43.579
century temple in Jerusalem.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.700
This low wall, called the Saurag, marked the boundary that Gentiles could not cross.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.820
Only Jews were permitted to enter further into the temple area.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.500
According to 1st century Jewish historian Josephus, the Saurag had signs in Greek and Latin

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.780
warning non-Jews not to go beyond it.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.540
Apparently, those who did could face the death penalty.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.659
Two such signs have been found, one in 1871 and another in 1935.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.980
They both bear inscriptions warning foreigners not to enter.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.260
On one occasion, Paul was marked in the temple because the Jews wrongfully accused him

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.140
of bringing Gentiles into the area fenced off by the Saurag.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.500
The symbolic wall of the Mosaic law that divided Jews and Gentiles was abolished on the basis

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.700
of Christ's death.
