00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:12.179
All these bills and so little we can afford, I can hardly breathe.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:32.280
Wait till you're married. That might never happen.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:51.189
It's been hard since Monika died. It's good to talk to someone who understands me.

00:00:51.189 --> 00:01:06.079
A promotion would fix all this. She understands me.

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.079
Sometimes I wonder, what would it be like to be with Markle?

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.079
It's like everyone knows about sex, but me.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:28.650
Okay, they'll want some evenings, weekends, my meetings, service, my kids.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.650
Maybe I could make it work.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.650
Jehovah has always been there for me.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.049
But I know why Jehovah tells us to wait.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.049
He doesn't deny his good things. He protects us, so we don't get hurt.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:02:18.379
I know Jehovah understands me best. I want to stay close to him.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:46.159
I know Jehovah knows what we need, and he will provide, because he promised it.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:03:08.449
And he always has, I am determined to wait patiently on my God.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:15.020
And never do anything that would displace him.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.020
Because his blessings are so worth the wait.
