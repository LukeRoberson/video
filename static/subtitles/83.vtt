00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.360
Welcome to the June 2021 program of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:31.859
The 149th Class of Gilead graduated on January 16, 2021.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.859
The students were able to take full advantage of the school,

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.859
despite the pandemic, and the extra efforts to remain safe.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.859
How would they use their training in this time of the end?

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.859
How did they personally benefit from the school?

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:55.229
Let's find out in part one of this historic graduation program.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:02.229
This has indeed been a unique class of Gilead at a most unique time in world events.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.230
The Bethel family is fully aware of what transpired.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.230
But since this program will be broadcast to our global brotherhood,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.230
let me remind all of you of what transpired.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:24.859
You're well aware of the unique time in world events, a global pandemic.

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.859
But what makes this class so unique?

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.859
A normal class of Gilead consists of 50 some students.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.859
The 149th class is made up of just 25.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.859
Your class is abnormal.

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.859
But why?

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:46.859
You know why.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:52.859
But let me share your experience with the worldwide brotherhood.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.859
Those who had been invited to attend this class of Gilead had begun to arrive

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.859
at the Educational Center in Patterns of New York.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:08.860
The 25 students in this class actually arrived in mid-March of 2020.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.860
And as we all know, it was at that time that the coronavirus

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.860
was declared to be a global pandemic.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.860
Most travel was shut down.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.860
The rest of their classmates could not come.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.860
Due to government restrictions on educational facilities, the 149th class had to be postponed.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.430
You students were stuck at Patterns in New York with no classes in session.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.430
Commendably, many of you were able to work remotely

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.430
for your home branch office in the interim.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.430
Finally, here in New York,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.430
government agencies allowed for educational facilities to again conduct classes

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.430
if physical distancing could be maintained.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.430
With just 25 of you, that was possible in the Gilead lecture hall.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:16.430
So we have only 25 abnormal students who will graduate today to clarify.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.430
It is the number of students that makes this class abnormal.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:32.430
But I'm told by your instructors that individually, you are very normal.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.430
In fact, they are very impressed with your spirituality and your Christian personalities.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.430
You have excelled in your studies and classroom participation.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.430
It's a delight to be with you on this very special day.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.430
What else though makes this an abnormal Gilead graduation?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.430
You were not able to invite family members and close friends to be here in person with you

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.430
for this exciting event.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.430
However, the teaching committee made arrangements for you to tie in a number of these ones

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.430
for a stream recording of the program.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.430
And the good news is that the entire program is being recorded

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:26.430
and will be posted as a future JW Broadcasting Monthly program in all of the approved languages.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.430
We have a few statistics to share about the 149th class.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.430
Of the 25 students, eight or married couples, seven are single brothers,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.430
and there are two single sisters in the class.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.899
I guess they're still single.

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:51.899
All we're serving at a Bethel Branch Facility are at a regional translation office

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.899
before attending school.

00:04:53.899 --> 00:05:04.310
The students are from 14 different countries and speak 29 different languages.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.310
Their average age is 41. That's a good age.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.310
44 years ago, I was 41.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.779
Their average age and full-time service is 20.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:20.779
In the Bible, Gilead referred to a territory in Israel,

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:29.779
and that name, Gilead, was derived from a Hebrew word that meant witness heap.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:37.779
When the school was first inaugurated in 1943, Gilead was an appropriate name.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.779
One of the instructors described the purpose of the school saying,

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:49.779
it was to instill in the students a more intense desire to share in the evangelizing work.

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:58.779
And for decades, thousands of missionaries were sent out to open up new territories around the world.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.779
A heap of witness was given during that period of time.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:09.779
However, in 2011, the governing body adjusted this specific purpose of Gilead.

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:14.779
Instead of focusing on opening up new territories for preaching,

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:17.779
the purpose of the curriculum changed.

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:26.779
As we mentioned previously, this entire class was already serving at a Bethel facility

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.779
or a regional translation office.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:42.779
The goal of Gilead is now to bolster such ones so as to strengthen and stabilize God's people in the respective territories to which they will be assigned.

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.779
Then what about the all-important evangelizing work?

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:50.779
Who is assisting with the heap of witness worldwide?

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:57.639
That's now the focus of the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:08.639
Each branch committee selects qualified pioneers who are willing to be transferred to another part of the country that needs help with the preaching work.

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:17.639
By using the large pool of zealous local pioneers, the heap of witness is still being given.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.639
Where the need is great.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:28.639
These local ones are already adapted to the culture, climate, and living conditions in their countries.

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:33.639
And oftentimes they already know the language where there is the greatest need.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:45.639
However, the 25 of you in this class of Gilead are expected to strengthen and stabilize God's people where you are assigned.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:49.639
Well, what does that entail?

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:56.639
For you brothers, in time it may mean you will be given more responsibility.

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:03.639
But your training has given you another way to stabilize fellow believers in your assignment.

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:09.639
And this applies to all 25 of you whether brothers or sisters.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:13.639
You've been elevated while here at the Gilead.

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:22.639
In fact, in the territory of Gilead in the Bible, the elevation changes dramatically.

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:31.639
In the Jordan Valley, Gilead was 690 feet, 210 meters, being low sea level.

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:45.639
But traveling east to the dome-like mountainous region of Gilead, the elevation rises to over 3,300 feet or 1,000 meters.

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:50.639
You students came to Gilead, be low sea level.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:57.639
But with daily Bible study and lectures, you have been elevated.

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:02.639
Throughout the past five months, your faith has grown.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:06.639
Your spirituality has been enhanced.

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:10.639
Your Christian personality has been refined.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:13.639
You have been elevated.

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:23.639
You will be going out to your assignment, not so much for a heap of witness, but as a heap of example.

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:37.909
This way, you will strengthen and stabilize those you work with at the branch and those you associate with in your congregations.

00:09:37.909 --> 00:09:42.909
Find a Deuteronomy 8-17-18.

00:09:42.909 --> 00:09:57.480
Never forget that your power and strength, your spiritual wealth, does not originate with you.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:03.480
It is Jehovah who has made this transformation in you.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.480
Read with me Deuteronomy 8-17-18.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:18.480
If you should say in your heart, my own power and the strength of my own hand have produced this wealth for me.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:25.480
Remember that it is Jehovah your God who gives power to you to make well.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:32.480
In order to carry out his covenant, that he swore to your forefathers as it is today.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:39.850
Today, you will graduate from the 149th class of Gilead.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:57.429
But you will strengthen and stabilize those in your assignment if you remember that it is Jehovah your God who gives power to you.

00:10:57.429 --> 00:11:02.429
For decades, we have been reminded to read God's Word daily.

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:09.940
It was even painted on the side of the factory building in Brooklyn for decades.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:15.940
David Splein is going to take that a step farther with his theme.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.940
Enjoy your Bible reading.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:24.019
The Bible is a wonderful book.

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:28.019
It's a book that we should just enjoy reading.

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:34.019
So for this talk, I thought I'd give a couple of suggestions for adding to our reading pleasure.

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:36.019
Here's the first.

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:40.019
Don't pass quickly over the details.

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:43.019
Stop and investigate.

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:46.019
And at times, you'll be very glad you did.

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:48.019
Now let's take an example.

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:51.019
You're reading in the book of First Chronicles.

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:56.019
Now there are a lot of names in First Chronicles, and you come across the name Himan.

00:11:56.019 --> 00:12:02.019
If you were just interested in covering material, you'd probably pass over it and go on to the next verse.

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:04.019
But you're not in a rush.

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:07.019
And you notice a cross reference beside the name.

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:10.019
It refers to you to First Chronicles 633.

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:12.019
So you decide to investigate.

00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:17.019
And in doing so, you'll learn something heartwarming about Jehovah.

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:18.019
Let's do that.

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:20.019
First Chronicles chapter 6.

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:23.019
I'll give you a moment.

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:27.580
And verse 33.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.580
It says,

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.580
These are the men who served with their sons.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.080
Of the co-haffites,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.580
Himan, the singer,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.580
Son of Jewel,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.580
Son of Samuel.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.580
So this Himan

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.580
was Samuel's grandson.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.580
Now what do we know about his family situation?

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.580
Well, his father, Joel and his uncle, Abija, were judges.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.580
But they had a terrible reputation.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.580
They'd rule in your favor if you could pay enough.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.580
But if you were poor, forget it.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.580
And the whole country knew about it.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:10.580
At one point, the Bible says that all the elders of Israel came to Samuel and said,

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.580
They didn't want Joel and Abija as judges anymore.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.580
They wanted a king.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.580
Jehovah was furious.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.580
And he couldn't have been too happy with Joel and Abija either.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:31.580
Now can you imagine the effect that this corruption had on the reputation of Himan's family?

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.580
The shame?

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.580
But like Hezekiah,

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.580
Himan didn't allow his father's, by example, to paralyze him.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.580
Himan developed his own personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.580
How do we know?

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.580
We followed a few clues.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.580
We followed a few cross-references.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.580
And we came to First Chronicles chapter 25 and verse 5.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.580
Let's do that.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.580
First Chronicles chapter 25 and verse 5.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:04.580
And again, we're trying to find something more about Himan.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.580
It says all of these were sons of Himan,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:13.580
a visionary of the king and matters pertaining to the true God to his glory.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:19.580
Thus the true God gave Himan 14 sons and three daughters.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.580
Did you see it?

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.580
A visionary of the king.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.580
What was a visionary?

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.580
It was a kind of prophet.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.580
Now let's see.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.580
Samuel was a prophet.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.580
And now, Himan was a prophet.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.580
Do you see what's heartwarming?

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:42.580
Jehovah was dealing with Himan in much the same way he had dealt with his grandfather.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:48.580
Jehovah does not hold the sins of the fathers against the sons.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.580
That is something very, very nice to remember.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.580
And can you see where this example would help some people you know?

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.580
Some, even in full-time service, have a hard time with it,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.580
because they had a rough family background,

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.580
and they may feel that they're worthless.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.580
Mary is a case in point.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.580
I'm going to call her Mary.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:16.580
Now, Mary's father was so violent that at times Mary, her mom and her siblings,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.580
had to get up in the middle of the night and run for their lives.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.580
And to the neighbors, they were that family.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.580
To make it worse, they were poor.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.580
So all this made Mary feel worthless.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.580
Until?

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.580
Until the day when she started studying with the witnesses.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:42.580
She developed her own relationship with Jehovah, and she accepted Him as her father.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.580
And today, Mary's a pioneer.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.580
How does she feel about her life?

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.580
Here's what she wrote.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.580
Jehovah is constantly looking for those who want a friendship with Him.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.580
And here's a touching point.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.580
He's even looking into the hearts of children.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.580
Isn't that nice?

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.580
Now, there are two lessons here.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:09.580
As humans' example shows, our family background doesn't define who we are.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.580
Jehovah will deal with us as individuals.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.580
And a second example, one for the elders.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.580
Me like Jehovah, treat each member of the family as an individual.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.580
Don't lump them all in together.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.580
Not our second point.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:30.580
We can make our Bible reading more enjoyable if we try to fill in the blanks.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.580
And that's something that our Bible dramas do.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.580
They fill in the blanks for us.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.580
Now, let's illustrate.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:40.580
Let's consider the example of Queen Esther and the King's Son.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.580
Now, you remember the story.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.580
King of Hazueras, who was understood to be Xerxes I,

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.580
was displeased with Queen Vashtai, and he decided he was going to replace her.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:57.580
So a call went out, enter the whole Persian Empire for the most beautiful women

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.580
to be brought to the palace.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.580
And Esther was among them.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.579
Now, the women were placed under the care of a man named Haggai,

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.579
and his job was to get them ready to meet the king.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:16.579
Well, when we read Esther chapter 2 and verse 9, we smell trouble.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:17.579
Let's read it.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:22.579
And you see if you can figure out what trouble is looming here.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:26.579
Esther chapter 2 and verse 9.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.579
Remember, we're trying to fill in the blanks, we'll try to imagine.

00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:35.579
Now, the young woman, Esther, was pleasing to him, Haggai,

00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:39.579
and won his favor.

00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:42.579
Now, this is a competition.

00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:43.579
Keep that in mind.

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:44.579
This is a competition.

00:17:44.579 --> 00:17:49.579
So he promptly arranged for her beauty treatments and her diet.

00:17:49.579 --> 00:17:50.579
Wait a minute.

00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:53.579
That's another detail we'll have to pursue sometime.

00:17:53.579 --> 00:17:55.579
Esther was Jewish.

00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:57.579
She was trying to hide the fact that she was Jewish.

00:17:57.579 --> 00:17:59.579
And there were so many things that Jews couldn't eat.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.579
How did she handle that?

00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:02.579
And that's for another day.

00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:03.579
That's Karyon.

00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:07.579
And talking about Haggai, it says he assigned it to her

00:18:07.579 --> 00:18:11.579
seven selected young women from the king's house.

00:18:11.579 --> 00:18:15.579
He also transferred her and her young attendants

00:18:15.579 --> 00:18:19.579
to the best place in the house of the women.

00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:21.579
Do you smell trouble?

00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:22.579
You see the problem?

00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:24.579
Preferential treatment.

00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:26.579
This is a competition.

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:30.579
Probably there's a lot of jealousy going on among the candidates.

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:34.579
And now Haggai is doing everything in his power to help Esther

00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:36.579
to win the king's heart.

00:18:36.579 --> 00:18:38.579
How do you suppose that went down?

00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:40.579
It could have led to big trouble.

00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:42.579
And here's another factor.

00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:44.579
What about the king's wives?

00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:46.579
Now, there was only one queen.

00:18:46.579 --> 00:18:48.579
But a haziurus had many wives.

00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:51.579
Some say he had 330 wives.

00:18:51.579 --> 00:18:54.579
Now, when Vashtai was deposed,

00:18:54.579 --> 00:18:59.579
who do you suppose expected to become the queen?

00:18:59.579 --> 00:19:01.579
The number two wife.

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:04.579
And yet, instead of going into the harem and choosing someone,

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:08.579
they went outside the palace even to women who didn't have a royal blood.

00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:12.579
How do you suppose that went down?

00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:14.579
And I'll think about this.

00:19:14.579 --> 00:19:19.579
Some scholars believe that although Vashtai was deposed as queen,

00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:21.579
she didn't leave the palace.

00:19:21.579 --> 00:19:24.579
That she just couldn't ever see the king again.

00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:27.579
If she was still there as some scholars believe,

00:19:27.579 --> 00:19:30.579
was she plotting in the background?

00:19:30.579 --> 00:19:34.579
This could have been a very difficult situation.

00:19:34.579 --> 00:19:39.579
But Esther 2 verse 15 tells us something very interesting about Esther.

00:19:39.579 --> 00:19:43.980
We're going to read just the end of verse 15.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.980
Esther 2 at the end of verse 15.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.980
It says, all the while,

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:54.980
Esther was winning the favor of everyone who saw her.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.980
Esther avoided the landmines.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.980
What does that tell us?

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.980
She was not only a very beautiful woman,

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.980
she had a beautiful, godly personality,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.980
a winning personality.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.980
Well, we said this was about Esther and the king's son.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.980
Who is the king's son? The heir.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.980
Well, we met him at the convention this past summer.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.980
He was the man who was so nice to Nehemiah.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.980
Artazerxes.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.980
And if the historians have their facts straight,

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.980
Artazerxes would have been only three years old

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.980
when Esther married his father.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.980
Now, history tells us that as kings of Persia go,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.980
Artazerxes had a very nice personality.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.980
He was mild, peaceful, kind,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.980
so unlike his father, who had a terrible temper.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.980
We have to ask,

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.980
did Esther have anything to do with the pleasant disposition

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.980
of Artazerxes?

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.980
Maybe she did. Who knows?

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.980
We're using our imagination.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.980
We're trying to fill in the blanks.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.980
Well, we haven't discussed anything earth-shaking here,

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.980
and that isn't the point of this talk.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:09.980
But if you investigate the details and fill in the blanks,

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.980
it'll contribute to the pleasure you derive from reading the Bible.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.980
And if Bible reading is a pleasant experience for you,

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.980
you'll have no trouble to arrange a schedule

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.980
of daily Bible reader.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.650
Enjoy.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.650
Thank you, brothers Blaine.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.650
We enjoyed your presentation,

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:38.650
and we look forward to enjoying our Bible reading even more.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.650
Next on our program,

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.650
we will hear from Brother Seth Hyatt,

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.650
a helper to the service committee.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.650
He has the catchy theme for us.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.650
What do you want me to do for you?

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.650
Brother Hyatt, please.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:59.150
I know you agree.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:03.150
Your Gilead training has been a gift,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.150
a gift from Jehovah, Jesus Christ,

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.150
and the faithful and discreet slave.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:15.150
Have you thought about how you're going to share your gift

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:19.150
and allow others to benefit from your training

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.150
when you return to your assignment?

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.150
It's a good question.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.150
When we get back to the busyness of a routine,

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:33.150
perhaps the stress and anxieties of increased responsibility,

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:38.150
sharing a gift may be the last thing on your mind.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.150
So it's good to think about it now.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:48.150
What will help you to strengthen, encourage, motivate,

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:54.150
and instruct those who you oversee, your workmates,

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.150
your brothers and sisters in the congregation?

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:03.150
We can learn much from the way Jesus dealt with people.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:08.150
Like you, Jesus was entrusted with a beautiful gift.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:14.150
Unlike you and me, Jesus had some amazing abilities.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:18.150
For example, he could read hearts.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.150
The scriptures describe an occasion

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:27.150
when Jesus responded to a man's thoughts rather than to his words.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:32.150
Do you think Jesus' ability to know what his audience was thinking

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:39.150
and feeling enhanced his effectiveness as he shared his gift?

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.150
Of course.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.150
But interestingly, the scriptures reveal

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:49.150
that Jesus dignified people in the way he communicated with them.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:53.150
He often asked meaningful questions

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:58.150
and listened attentively to the answers

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:02.150
before he shared his gift.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.150
For a few minutes this morning,

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:09.150
let's consider two occasions when Jesus did just that.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:13.150
In doing so, we'll get some pointers

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.150
that will assist you to be effective

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:21.150
in sharing your gift of Gilead training.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.150
The first account is found in the Bible book of Mark, chapter 10.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.150
Let's turn there to gather.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.150
Mark, chapter 10, beginning in verse 35.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:37.359
James and John, the sons of Zebedee,

00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:39.359
approached him and said to him,

00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:46.359
teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:49.359
He said to them,

00:24:49.359 --> 00:24:53.359
what do you want me to do for you?

00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:55.359
They replied,

00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:58.359
grant us to sit down one at your right hand

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:03.309
and one at your left in your glory.

00:25:03.309 --> 00:25:06.309
The parallel account in Matthew

00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:10.309
reveals that James and John did not approach Jesus

00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:12.309
on their own.

00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:16.309
They had their mother do it for them.

00:25:16.309 --> 00:25:21.309
Do you think as this woman approached Jesus,

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:25.309
he knew what she wanted?

00:25:25.309 --> 00:25:27.309
Probably.

00:25:27.309 --> 00:25:30.309
How did he deal with her?

00:25:30.309 --> 00:25:32.309
Did he interrupt her?

00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:34.309
Reprimand her?

00:25:34.309 --> 00:25:35.309
No.

00:25:35.309 --> 00:25:39.309
Instead he asked a question.

00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:42.309
What do you want me to do for you?

00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:47.750
The second account is just a few verses down.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:52.750
Mark, chapter 10, beginning in verse 46.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:57.750
Here we learn about a blind beggar named Bartimaeus.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.750
He sat by the road,

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:03.750
and when he heard that Jesus was passing by, he called out.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.750
Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.750
The crowd tried to quiet him,

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.750
but Bartimaeus called out even more loudly.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.750
Jesus stopped and said,

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:22.509
bring him to me.

00:26:22.509 --> 00:26:27.509
Now Bartimaeus had an audience with the Son of God.

00:26:27.509 --> 00:26:32.890
How did Jesus address Bartimaeus?

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:34.890
In verse 51,

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.890
Jesus said to him,

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:41.890
what do you want me to do for you?

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.890
The blind man said to him,

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.890
rebony,

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.890
let me recover my sight.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.890
And Jesus said to him,

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.890
go, your faith has made you well.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.890
And immediately he recovered his sight

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:03.460
and he began to follow Jesus on the road.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.460
What do you want me to do for you?

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.460
The same question in both accounts, very different situations.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:18.990
Why do you think Jesus asked this question?

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.990
Well, he accomplished at least four things.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.990
What were they?

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:27.990
Well, first of all,

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.990
he dignified his audience

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:35.849
by encouraging communication.

00:27:35.849 --> 00:27:37.849
Number two,

00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:44.849
he allowed his audience to reveal what was in his or her heart,

00:27:44.849 --> 00:27:50.819
to put it on the table as it were.

00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:52.819
In his dealings with James and John,

00:27:52.819 --> 00:27:57.819
the question actually protected Jesus

00:27:57.819 --> 00:28:02.819
and gave him an opportunity to give those two apostles

00:28:02.819 --> 00:28:06.819
a valuable lesson in modesty.

00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:09.819
This matter of giving the right and left places in the kingdom

00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:11.819
is not mine to give.

00:28:11.819 --> 00:28:17.519
Finally, in the case of Bartimaeus,

00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:21.519
would you agree the question provided opportunity

00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:24.519
to strengthen Bartimaeus' faith

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:28.519
and to give him effective assistance?

00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:32.519
Allowing Bartimaeus to articulate his desire,

00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:35.519
what do you want?

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:39.519
And then to experience the immediate realization

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:42.519
would have left no doubt in Bartimaeus' mind

00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:44.519
that he had been considered.

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:46.519
And how did it affect him?

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:53.519
Well, the account says he began to follow Jesus on the road.

00:28:53.519 --> 00:28:58.519
It's a beautiful example of asking a question

00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:03.519
that helps you to share your gift.

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:08.089
When I was a newly appointed circuit overseer,

00:29:08.089 --> 00:29:11.089
the elders in a congregation that I was serving

00:29:11.089 --> 00:29:16.089
expressed concern about a sister who was missing meetings.

00:29:16.089 --> 00:29:19.089
They asked me if I would be willing to make a shepherding visit.

00:29:19.089 --> 00:29:22.089
Of course, I was happy to do that.

00:29:22.089 --> 00:29:24.089
The arrangements were made,

00:29:24.089 --> 00:29:27.089
another elder accompanied me,

00:29:27.089 --> 00:29:31.089
and I shared all of the appropriate verses

00:29:31.089 --> 00:29:34.089
about meeting attendants.

00:29:34.089 --> 00:29:36.089
The sister listened,

00:29:36.089 --> 00:29:38.089
and as we were leaving,

00:29:38.089 --> 00:29:40.089
she looked me in the eye,

00:29:40.089 --> 00:29:42.089
and she said,

00:29:42.089 --> 00:29:45.559
you don't have a clue.

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:49.559
At the time, I thought she was being disrespectful.

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:52.559
But as I thought about it,

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.559
I came to wish that instead of showing up

00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:58.559
with all the appropriate verses,

00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:03.559
I had showed up with all of the appropriate questions.

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:07.559
What do you want me to do for you?

00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:09.559
How may I help?

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:13.559
What's been happening in your life?

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:17.559
Those kinds of questions allow you

00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:21.559
to render meaningful assistance.

00:30:21.559 --> 00:30:24.559
I learned from that experience.

00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:27.559
I hope you can learn from my mistake.

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:30.559
Don't make the mistake of thinking you know

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:33.559
what a person wants or needs.

00:30:33.559 --> 00:30:35.559
Jesus did know,

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:41.420
and he still asked questions.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.859
Didn't I find the audience?

00:30:45.859 --> 00:30:50.859
Allow your listener to reveal what is in his or her heart.

00:30:50.859 --> 00:30:53.859
It may protect you,

00:30:53.859 --> 00:30:57.859
and it allows you to render meaningful assistance.

00:30:57.859 --> 00:31:02.859
Approach your assignment the way Jesus approached his.

00:31:03.859 --> 00:31:06.859
What do you want me to do for you?

00:31:06.859 --> 00:31:08.859
If you do,

00:31:08.859 --> 00:31:12.859
not only will you effectively share your gift,

00:31:12.859 --> 00:31:18.839
you will be a gift wherever you serve.

00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:20.839
Thank you, Brother Hyatt.

00:31:20.839 --> 00:31:23.839
For opening our eyes to Jesus' question,

00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:29.630
what do you want me to do for you?

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.630
You will now enjoy Brother Alex Rhyme,

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.630
a helper to the publishing committee

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.630
of the inspiring subject,

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.630
let Jehovah inspire you.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:45.779
Have you ever had an important decision,

00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:47.779
suddenly thrust on you?

00:31:47.779 --> 00:31:49.779
You thought you knew the right thing to do,

00:31:49.779 --> 00:31:51.779
but as soon as you decide,

00:31:51.779 --> 00:31:53.779
you start having second thoughts,

00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:55.779
maybe even regrets.

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:57.779
And now you can't stop thinking,

00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:00.779
did I do the right thing?

00:32:00.779 --> 00:32:04.779
This tendency to repeat a thought over and over again

00:32:04.779 --> 00:32:06.779
is called rumination.

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:09.779
And when those thoughts make us feel anxious,

00:32:09.779 --> 00:32:12.779
it can be bad for our health.

00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:14.779
Some of you students made tough decisions

00:32:14.779 --> 00:32:16.779
before you came to this class.

00:32:16.779 --> 00:32:18.779
Thank you for that.

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:21.779
And everyone right now is faced with challenging decisions

00:32:21.779 --> 00:32:23.779
every day.

00:32:23.779 --> 00:32:29.779
So what can we do to stop anxious rumination once it starts?

00:32:29.779 --> 00:32:33.779
Well, open your Bibles with me to Psalm 37 verse 5,

00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:36.779
and notice the advice that is given to us here.

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:41.700
Commit your way to Jehovah,

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.700
rely on him,

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.700
and he will act in your behalf.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.700
Now the word for commit here literally means

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.700
to roll or remove something from our life.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.700
So as the footnote says,

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.700
we need to roll our way,

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.700
our concerns, our anxieties upon Jehovah.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.700
When we ruminate anxiously,

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.700
we're holding on to our problem.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.700
But the Bible says through prayer,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.700
we have to take the problem off our shoulders

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.700
and put it on Jehovah's.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.700
In other words, we no longer act as if the burden is ours.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.700
We need to leave it in his hands.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.700
It sounds so simple,

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.700
but at times it's hard to do.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.700
So what can help us when we have trouble letting go?

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.700
Well, our suggestion today

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.700
is to let Jehovah inspire you with awe.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.700
Now to inspire someone

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.700
means to make them feel that they want to do something

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.700
and can do it.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.700
And it may be that Jehovah gave us the emotion of awe

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.700
for that very purpose.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.700
You may be wondering now,

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.700
how can awe help me?

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.700
Well, open your Bibles again.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.700
This time to Genesis chapter 28.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.700
And let's look at an example together

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.699
that illustrates how this can work.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:09.699
In verse 10,

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.699
we catch up with the patriarch Jacob.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:14.699
He's on the road.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:15.699
Notice,

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:18.699
Jacob departed from Beersheba

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:21.699
and kept going toward Herod.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.699
Why was he going there?

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.699
Well, the main reason was to get away from his brother Issa.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:28.699
Why?

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.699
Because Jacob had just made a tough decision

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.699
and Issa was mad.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.699
You know the story.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:38.699
For most of his life,

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:41.699
Issa despised the family birthright.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.699
And that upset Jacob very much.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.699
So at some point,

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:48.699
he purchased the birthright from him.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:49.699
Years go by.

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:51.699
And then one day,

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:54.699
their father Isaac is getting ready to bless Issa

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:56.699
as the firstborn.

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:58.699
Can you picture the scene?

00:34:58.699 --> 00:35:02.699
What was Jacob going to do?

00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:05.699
It's not possible today to know all the factors

00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:08.699
that influenced Isaac, Rebecca, and Jacob back then.

00:35:08.699 --> 00:35:10.699
But the fact is,

00:35:10.699 --> 00:35:14.699
Jacob's decision put a strain on the whole family.

00:35:14.699 --> 00:35:18.699
Issa began plotting to kill his brother.

00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:22.699
And that's why Jacob was on the road.

00:35:22.699 --> 00:35:24.699
Do you think he might have been

00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:27.699
ruminating a bit that day on what happened?

00:35:27.699 --> 00:35:30.699
Did he perhaps have second thoughts?

00:35:30.699 --> 00:35:32.699
Was he asking himself,

00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:34.699
did I do the right thing?

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:37.699
Was it okay to fool my father?

00:35:37.699 --> 00:35:40.699
What does Jehovah think of me now?

00:35:40.699 --> 00:35:43.699
Those would have been reasonable questions.

00:35:43.699 --> 00:35:46.699
Of course, we don't know what Jacob was thinking.

00:35:46.699 --> 00:35:49.699
But if he was having second thoughts,

00:35:49.699 --> 00:35:51.699
what happened next

00:35:51.699 --> 00:35:54.699
must have helped him to stop ruminating on them.

00:35:54.699 --> 00:35:58.699
Notice what we read in verses 11 and 12.

00:35:58.699 --> 00:36:00.699
In time,

00:36:00.699 --> 00:36:02.699
he came to a place

00:36:02.699 --> 00:36:04.699
and prepared to spend the night there

00:36:04.699 --> 00:36:06.699
because the sun had set.

00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:09.699
So he took one of the stones of that place

00:36:09.699 --> 00:36:11.699
and set it to rest his head on

00:36:11.699 --> 00:36:13.699
and lay down there.

00:36:13.699 --> 00:36:15.699
Then he had a dream.

00:36:15.699 --> 00:36:16.699
And look,

00:36:16.699 --> 00:36:19.699
there was a stairway set on the earth

00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:23.699
and its top reached up to the heavens.

00:36:23.699 --> 00:36:26.699
And there were God's angels ascending

00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:28.699
and descending on it.

00:36:28.699 --> 00:36:31.699
Now, this heavenly ladder

00:36:31.699 --> 00:36:34.699
may have looked like a rising flight of stones,

00:36:34.699 --> 00:36:38.699
like the one you see here in this illustration.

00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:42.699
Jacob could see now that he was not alone.

00:36:42.699 --> 00:36:44.699
He was a small part

00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:48.699
of an awesome organization.

00:36:48.699 --> 00:36:50.699
And there's communication

00:36:50.699 --> 00:36:53.699
between the different parts of that organization.

00:36:53.699 --> 00:36:54.699
Angels,

00:36:54.699 --> 00:36:56.699
ministers in some important way

00:36:56.699 --> 00:36:58.699
between Jehovah

00:36:58.699 --> 00:37:00.699
and humans who have his approval.

00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:02.699
And there was more.

00:37:02.699 --> 00:37:05.699
Let's continue in verse 13.

00:37:05.699 --> 00:37:07.699
And look,

00:37:07.699 --> 00:37:10.699
there was Jehovah stationed above it.

00:37:10.699 --> 00:37:12.699
And he said,

00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:13.699
I am Jehovah,

00:37:13.699 --> 00:37:14.699
the God of Abraham,

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:15.699
your father,

00:37:15.699 --> 00:37:17.699
and the God of Isaac.

00:37:17.699 --> 00:37:20.699
The land on which you are lying,

00:37:20.699 --> 00:37:21.699
to you,

00:37:21.699 --> 00:37:23.699
I am going to give it

00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:26.699
and to your offspring.

00:37:26.699 --> 00:37:28.699
How comforting those words

00:37:28.699 --> 00:37:31.699
must have been to Jacob.

00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:33.699
Jehovah wasn't displeased with him,

00:37:33.699 --> 00:37:35.699
quite the contrary.

00:37:35.699 --> 00:37:37.699
He promised to bless Jacob

00:37:37.699 --> 00:37:40.699
in a marvelous way.

00:37:40.699 --> 00:37:44.699
Jehovah apparently used this awesome experience

00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:46.699
to help Jacob to let go

00:37:46.699 --> 00:37:49.699
of any anxiety he might have had.

00:37:49.699 --> 00:37:52.699
As long as he continued to do his best,

00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:54.699
Jacob could trust Jehovah

00:37:54.699 --> 00:37:56.699
to do the rest.

00:37:56.699 --> 00:37:58.699
What a relief.

00:37:58.699 --> 00:38:00.699
Notice his reaction in verse 17.

00:38:00.699 --> 00:38:04.070
And he grew fearful

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.070
and added,

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:10.070
how awe-inspiring this place is.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:12.070
This can only be the house of God.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:16.070
And this is the gate of the heavens.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.070
Jacob's relief here is almost palpable.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.070
He's no longer conflicted.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.070
The vision inspires him

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:27.070
to make a vow of loyalty to Jehovah forever.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.070
You can read what he did and said

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.070
in the latter part of this chapter.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:38.070
Now, verse 17 uses the same Hebrew word twice.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:43.070
The first time, it's translated as fearful.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:47.070
The second time, as awe-inspiring.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:52.070
And that may be because awe is a surprising emotion.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:58.070
It's a wonderful mix of inspiration and fear.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.070
You sense you're in the presence of someone

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.070
or something greater than yourself,

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:07.070
but it makes you feel small in a good way.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.070
Aw can humble you.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.070
And that shifts your thinking.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:15.070
It helps you to see things as they are

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.070
and not as you expect them to be.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:21.070
It's the kind of fear proverbs 1 and 7 says,

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:25.070
is the beginning of knowledge or wisdom.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.070
And that may be why at times,

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:31.070
Jehovah evokes awe in us.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.070
Like Jacob,

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.070
people often say they feel more centered

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:40.070
and spiritual after an awesome experience.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:44.070
Aw seems to pull us out of ourselves.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.070
It connects us on a deeper level with Jehovah.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:52.070
And it reconnects us with what is most important.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:57.070
Jehovah's sovereignty, his creation, and his people.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:03.610
Now, getting away from Issa did not end Jacob's problems.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.610
There were other times in his life

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:09.610
he again became very anxious and afraid.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.610
But true to his word,

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:15.610
Jehovah was always there.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:18.610
As long as Jacob was faithful,

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.610
Jehovah made sure he would succeed.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:26.610
20 years later when Jacob returned to Canaan with his family,

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:30.610
Jehovah sent out a company of angels to greet him.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.610
How awesome was that?

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.610
Well, what does all of this mean then for you and me?

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.610
Psalm 89 7 says,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:47.610
Jehovah is awe-inspiring to all those around him.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:52.610
If you've ever hiked in the Banff National Park

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:56.610
or walked in the mure woods

00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:01.610
or felt goose bumps as you looked up into the night sky,

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.610
you know what awe feels like.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:09.610
You've experienced Jehovah inspiring you.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.610
So the next time you need to get out of your head,

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.610
remember awe.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:17.610
Take a walk in the woods,

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:20.610
sing your favorite kingdom song.

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:24.610
awe may be the most underutilized way we know

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:28.610
to help us to stop ruminating on anxious thoughts

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:33.610
and fully commit our way to Jehovah.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.610
Don't let your problems stress you out.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:39.610
Do your research, pray for guidance,

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.610
make the best decision you can,

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:51.590
and then let Jehovah inspire you with awe.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:54.590
We enjoyed that presentation, Alex.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.590
Now we have one of the Gilead instructors

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:02.590
of Trent Leopold with the somewhat cryptic theme,

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.590
Mark Your Maribal.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:11.380
Brother Leopold, what do you mean with that?

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.380
He did not miss the sign the first time,

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.380
but the second time it meant his life.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.380
He was Moses.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.380
Our lives are full of signposts,

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.380
figurative markers for lessons, memories, experiences.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.380
Some good, some bad, some signposts we erect,

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.380
others are put up for us.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.380
In either case, they should help us to continue

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.380
in life successfully.

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:43.380
For instance, consider a lesson a signpost

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.380
in the life of Moses.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.380
It happened shortly after the crossing of the Red Sea,

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:51.380
and it's recorded in Exodus chapter 17,

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.380
at a place called Refidem, the Ezralites gather,

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:58.380
and there was Moses by a crag with his staff,

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.380
with a quarreling nation.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.380
The events there at Refidem provided a significant lesson

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.380
for Moses, something to remember for future circumstances,

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.380
and so he marked that spa.

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.380
How did he do it?

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.380
He changed the name from Refidem,

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:23.380
which meant refresh to Maribah, which meant quarreling.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:28.380
Little did Moses know that that name would ring in his ears.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:32.380
39 years later, at a place called Kadesh,

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.380
Moses was again near a crag with his staff,

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.380
with a quarreling nation before him.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.380
And based on the events that happened there,

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:49.380
look at what is recorded in Numbers chapter 20, verses 12 and 13.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.380
Numbers chapter 20, verses 12 and 13,

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.380
we read.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.380
Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron,

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.380
because you did not show faith in me and sanctify me before the eyes

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.380
of the people of Israel,

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:11.380
you will not bring this congregation into the land that I will give them.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.380
These are the waters of Maribah,

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.380
with the Israelites quarreled with Jehovah,

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.380
so that he was sanctified among them.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.380
Moses is taught a lesson here.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.380
It's unclear who exactly named the place Maribah,

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.380
but Moses did record it,

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.380
that these were the waters of Maribah,

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:34.380
an unforgettable signpost in Moses' life.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.380
What it meant to Moses was very clear.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.380
So what now?

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.380
What would Moses do following this?

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.380
Well, from verse 14, if we were to read,

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:47.380
we would see that Moses carried on with his assignment.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.380
He continued to lead the Israelites.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.380
He led them against the kings of Sihon and Og.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.380
He began to see Jehovah's mighty arm of power as they draw closer

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.380
and closer to the promised land.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.380
And in his enthusiasm,

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.380
Moses makes one request of Jehovah.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.380
He turns to him,

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.380
and we can read his words in Deuteronomy chapter 3,

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.380
verses 25 and 26.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:15.380
Moses' words in verse 25, he writes,

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.380
Please, let me pass over and see the good land

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.380
that is across the Jordan,

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:24.380
this good mountainous region, and Lebanon.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:29.380
But Jehovah was still furious with me because of you,

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:32.380
and he would not listen to me.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.380
Rather, Jehovah said to me,

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.380
Enough from you.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:41.380
Never speak to me again about this matter.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:47.380
Jehovah was still furious with me because of you.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.380
Maraba.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.380
That's what Moses is referring to.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.380
The signpost was clear from Moses.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.380
How would Moses respond to this?

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.380
What would he do?

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.380
Well, Moses carried on.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.380
He got back to work.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.380
Back to business.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.380
He wasn't finished.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.380
He continued to lead and shepherd the nation.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.380
He prepared Joshua to be his successor.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.380
And he worked along until Jehovah

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.380
came to Moses and said to him,

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:20.380
Moses is time to go to the mountain.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.380
In other words, it was time for Moses' death.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:28.380
Read, please, Jehovah's words to Moses in Deuteronomy chapter 32,

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.380
verses 51 and 52.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.380
Beginning in verse 51 of Deuteronomy 32,

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.380
we read Jehovah's words.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.380
Because both of you, that is, Moses and Aaron,

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.380
were unfaithful to me among the Israelites

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:51.380
at the waters of Maraba of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zinn,

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:56.380
because you did not sanctify me before the people of Israel.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.380
You will see the land from a distance,

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:03.380
but you will not enter the land that I am giving to the people of Israel.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:08.380
Jehovah draws Moses' attention back to Maraba.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:12.380
What effect did this have on Moses,

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.380
that Jehovah referred to Maraba again?

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.380
Well, think of this.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:22.380
After Jehovah's refusal to reconsider his judgment on Moses,

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.380
Moses continued fully dedicated to his assignment.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:30.980
In fact, the details make up the book of Deuteronomy.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:35.980
If you look at what happened shortly before Jehovah's words here in chapter 32,

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.980
we find Moses recited a beautiful song of praise to Jehovah.

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.980
Following Jehovah's words in chapter 33,

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:48.980
we find Moses here giving a blessing for the nation of Israel.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.980
Do you see what happened to Moses?

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.980
Moses marked the lessons and experiences in his life,

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.980
like Maraba.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.980
He was not paralyzed or broken by disappointment.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:07.980
Rather, his resolve to serve Jehovah faithfully was strengthened.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.980
What helped Moses?

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.980
How did he do it?

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.980
Consider at least two things that may have helped Moses.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.980
Number one, Moses' intimate friendship with Jehovah.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.980
For example, why would Moses even ask Jehovah

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.980
to reconsider his judgment on him?

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.980
Because Moses knew Jehovah intimately.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:38.980
He knew him to be a God merciful and compassionate and abundant in loving kindness.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.980
And when Jehovah refused to reconsider,

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.980
Moses did not say a word.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:46.980
Why?

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:52.980
Because Moses knew that Jehovah was also a God perfect in his activity

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.980
and that all his ways are justice.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:49:00.980
You see, for Moses' example, we see the more intimate our friendship is with Jehovah,

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.980
the more intimately he can teach us and train us.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.980
And thus, like Moses, it will be easier to get past disappointment

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:14.980
and continue in our assignment faithful and joyful.

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.980
Consider a second thing that may have helped Moses.

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:19.980
And that was Job.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.980
Remember, Moses wrote the book of Job

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:30.980
around 1473 around the same time as the events that took place at Maraba of Kadesh.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:34.980
The words are fresh in his mind.

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:38.980
Moses knew how Jehovah dealt with Job.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.980
For example, at Job 38, verse 3, Jehovah said to Job,

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:47.980
brace yourself, please, like a man, and I will question you.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:53.980
Moses knew how Job responded to his problems and to Jehovah's correction.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:57.980
For example, at Job 40, verse 4, Job said to Jehovah,

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.980
I put my hand over my mouth.

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:06.980
And Moses also knew the final outcome of the matters with Job.

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:12.980
Therefore, Moses was able to see his own difficulties and his own disappointments

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.980
through the prism of universal sovereignty.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.980
And that gave Moses perspective.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:24.980
So, take advantage of the inspired words of God at your disposal.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:32.980
Meditate deeply on the experiences of Jehovah's faithful servants like Job and like Moses.

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:39.980
These examples will give you perspective and allow you to move on joyfully.

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.980
Brothers and sisters, the simple truth is, in our life of service to God,

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.980
we may be treated unfairly.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.980
We will likely be disappointed at times.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:56.980
Our expectations may not be met, and we will respond poorly at times.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:01.980
Mark the moment as a lesson in life, a meribah.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:07.980
And if, as was the case with Moses, Jehovah marks it for you, be grateful.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.980
Do not be paralyzed or broken by disappointment.

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.980
Like Moses, fix in mind what you have to do.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.980
Allow the experience or the lesson to strengthen your resolve,

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:23.980
to serve Jehovah faithfully and joyfully.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:27.980
You can, if you mark your meribah.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:36.380
And now we know what you meant by the theme Mark, your meribah.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:41.380
And speaking of Mark, we will now listen to Mark Numer,

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:48.380
another Gilead instructor with the theme from Strength to Strength.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.380
It's all yours, brother Numer.

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:59.530
Today, it's a privilege to address you a very precious group of people.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:03.530
Your journey to this day has not been an easy one.

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:08.530
But in this talk, we want to focus on a specific journey.

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:11.530
The one that began when you were invited to Gilead,

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:15.530
up to your first day in class.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:19.530
Due to the lockdown, that journey brought you unexpected trials,

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:22.530
unknown to previous classes of Gilead.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:28.530
Along the way, you said many prayers and even shed some tears.

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:34.530
But instead of giving into despair, we're so proud of you, you became stronger.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:40.530
Your journey can be compared to the journey of a Levite,

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.530
as described in Psalm 84.

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:48.159
So let's open our Bibles to Psalm 84.

00:52:48.159 --> 00:52:51.159
And we're going to review the man's musings,

00:52:51.159 --> 00:52:56.159
as he traveled from his home to Jehovah's Temple, Psalm 84.

00:52:56.159 --> 00:53:02.159
And as we do, we will learn what it means to find strength in Jehovah.

00:53:02.159 --> 00:53:07.159
And what will help you to continue to go from strength to strength.

00:53:07.159 --> 00:53:10.159
So we can begin at verse 5.

00:53:10.159 --> 00:53:18.050
Happy are the men who find their strengths in you.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:21.050
Now, what does this mean?

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:25.050
To find strengths means you have to be looking for it.

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:29.050
So we look to Jehovah for strength.

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:31.050
How do we do that?

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.050
We do that by prayer and focus.

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:40.050
When we pray, we pray that Jehovah for his Holy Spirit

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:44.050
and focus on him, he gives us strength.

00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:49.050
Now, at first, this strength may be just enough to start a difficult journey,

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:54.050
such as you started when you received your invitation to Gilead.

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:59.050
But as the journey continues, you become stronger.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:04.050
If you take the right approach, well, what is that approach?

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:09.940
Well, let's read on, and we'll go to verse 6.

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.940
When they pass through the Baker Valley,

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:15.940
they make it into a place of springs

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.940
and the early rain closes it with blessings.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:23.940
There were many routes to travel to get to Jerusalem.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:28.940
But this Levite speaks of traveling through the Baker Valley.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.940
That's not the scenic route.

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:37.940
The Baker Valley was a dry, desolate, parched area.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.940
In fact, the word Baker comes from a Hebrew word to weep.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.940
It seems that the Baker plant exuded a type of milky sap,

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:51.940
giving the appearance of tears which added to the gloominess of this parched land.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.940
There may also have been literal tears,

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.940
a shed as ones made their long journey to Jerusalem.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:02.940
But notice, notice what this Levite was able to do

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.940
as he walked through this valley.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.940
There he says in verse 6,

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.940
they make it into a place of springs

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:15.940
and the early rain closes it with blessings.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:19.940
You see, this Levite was so focused on the joy

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.940
he would have worshipping at the temple

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:26.940
that as he walked through the dry, desolate, Baker Valley,

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.940
this scenery along the way looked attractive to him.

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:35.940
He was able to look at this dried up valley with eyes of faith

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:39.940
and make it into a place of water springs.

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.940
Now, how was that possible?

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:46.940
Well, it's like when a brother once described his trip

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.940
to the house of a sister he was courting.

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:54.940
It involved getting on, dirty buses, crowded subways, walking past,

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.940
dingy apartments, but to him,

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.940
the whole trip was a beautiful scene

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:04.940
because it was taking him to visit her.

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:07.940
Similarly, the Levite of Psalm 84

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.940
could see past the gloominess around him

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:13.940
and see Jehovah's blessings ahead.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:17.940
He was energized by thinking about his privilege

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.940
of actually serving at Jehovah's Temple.

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:25.940
To the point where even the Baker Valley was beautiful to him

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:30.940
because it led to the place he most wanted to be.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:35.940
And with that in focus, notice what happens.

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.820
Let's read verse seven.

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:43.820
They will walk on from strength to strength.

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:49.820
Each one appears before God in Zion.

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:53.820
Now what does that mean, strength to strength?

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.820
Though the Levite may have entered the Valley of Tears

00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.820
weak under the weight of his problems,

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:03.820
love for true worship fueled every step taken.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:07.820
He knew his service would be noticed by Jehovah

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:11.820
who would bless his whole soul's effort to serve him.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:16.820
That was the initial strength from Jehovah he had.

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:21.820
But when he finally arrived at the temple,

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:26.820
the joy of actually appearing before Jehovah God,

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:31.820
that joy and having his approval and blessing empowered him,

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:35.820
it energized him to walk from strength that Jehovah

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:39.820
initially gives to even greater strength.

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.820
In other words, it made him an even stronger person

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:47.820
than he was before beginning the journey.

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:53.579
Now for you students, your journey to Gilead

00:57:53.579 --> 00:57:55.579
was different from others.

00:57:55.579 --> 00:57:58.579
You did not take the scenic route.

00:57:58.579 --> 00:58:01.579
But in Jehovah's strengths,

00:58:01.579 --> 00:58:05.579
you were able to look beyond the four walls of quarantine,

00:58:05.579 --> 00:58:10.579
beyond the lockdown, beyond the start of class being postponed.

00:58:10.579 --> 00:58:14.579
You looked beyond the dry, parched ground of the Baker Valley

00:58:14.579 --> 00:58:18.579
and you saw Jehovah's blessing on his people

00:58:18.579 --> 00:58:21.579
as the governing body gave faithful

00:58:21.579 --> 00:58:24.579
and discrete direction to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:58:24.579 --> 00:58:28.579
You were right here, you watched it personally.

00:58:28.579 --> 00:58:31.579
So though you may have arrived here,

00:58:31.579 --> 00:58:33.579
weakened by your personal trials,

00:58:33.579 --> 00:58:37.579
after walking through your figurative bake a valley

00:58:37.579 --> 00:58:41.579
in Jehovah's strength, you came out stronger,

00:58:41.579 --> 00:58:45.579
to appear before Jehovah God,

00:58:45.579 --> 00:58:50.340
to be trained by his organization.

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:53.340
And then it was finally announced

00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:57.340
the school would start in August.

00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.340
And I remember, I remember the day

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:04.340
when you walked into the classroom for the first time

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.340
and you sat in your seats

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.340
and you opened up your student binder,

00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:11.340
you put your Bible on the desk

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:14.340
and as you looked up, your eyes revealed,

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:21.340
I made it to my journey and class began.

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:24.340
Day after day and it is noteworthy

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.340
that in Jehovah's strength,

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:30.340
not one of you, not one of you missed a day of class.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.340
That is to your credit,

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:34.340
you wanted to learn every day

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.340
you took advantage of every opportunity.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.340
Thank you for the zeal that you showed.

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:45.340
So yes, remember the lessons from class,

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.340
we know you will,

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:52.340
but also remember the lesson from your journey.

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:55.340
As you take on new assignments in the future,

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:59.340
see past the challenges along the way,

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.340
see past the disappointments, see past the tears,

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.340
turn your bake a valley into a spring

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:10.340
and you will become stronger for it.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.340
And you can do this through prayer.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.340
You can do this by praying for Jehovah,

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.340
praying to Jehovah for his spirit

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.340
and focusing on him.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.340
And remember, the end goal

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.340
is not the assignment in itself.

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:31.340
The assignment is just a means to experience your real goal

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.340
of having and maintaining Jehovah's blessing.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.340
If you prayerfully keep that in focus,

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.340
Jehovah will completely change your outlook

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.340
regarding the challenges in front of you.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.340
The parched land becomes streams of water,

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:50.340
the tears of pain become tears of joy.

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:56.340
You will see Jehovah make you walk on from strength to strength,

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.340
from the initial strength Jehovah gives

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:03.340
to becoming an ever stronger servant of his.

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.340
He will empower you,

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:08.340
not only to walk through the valley of hardships,

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:10.340
but you will be that much ready

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:13.340
for whatever work lies ahead.

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.340
You will be in a much better position

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.340
to appear before Jehovah,

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.340
your God, and enjoy his favor.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:24.590
So in conclusion,

01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.590
take the bake a valley route

01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:29.590
through all your challenges.

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:31.590
There's a wise saying,

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:35.590
a calm sea never made a good sailor.

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:38.590
Likewise, don't trade hardships for comfort

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:42.590
because you will feel a closeness to your Heavenly Father

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:45.590
in a way that you never would have experienced

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:48.590
if you hadn't walked from strength to strength

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:50.590
through the valley of Baker.

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:55.579
That was so encouraging.

01:01:55.579 --> 01:01:57.579
Soon, parched two and three

01:01:57.579 --> 01:01:58.579
of the Gilead Graduation

01:01:58.579 --> 01:02:02.579
will be available on JW.org.

01:02:03.579 --> 01:02:04.579
We know that you're eager

01:02:04.579 --> 01:02:07.579
to see the presentation in its entirety.

01:02:07.579 --> 01:02:09.579
To conclude,

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:11.579
let's visit Ireland.

01:02:11.579 --> 01:02:14.579
The land is known as the emerald isle

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:16.579
for its variety of lush,

01:02:16.579 --> 01:02:18.579
green landscapes.

01:02:18.579 --> 01:02:21.579
It stretches from the cliffs of Moher

01:02:21.579 --> 01:02:24.579
to the gentle valleys of Heli's pass,

01:02:24.579 --> 01:02:27.579
to the moor mountains in the north.

01:02:27.579 --> 01:02:29.579
The white wool of sheep spot

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:32.579
these grassy hills and valleys.

01:02:32.579 --> 01:02:35.579
But it was a different kind of sheep

01:02:35.579 --> 01:02:39.579
that brought CT Russell in 1891.

01:02:39.579 --> 01:02:42.579
It was the first stop in his tour of Europe.

01:02:42.579 --> 01:02:45.579
He traveled here some seven times

01:02:45.579 --> 01:02:47.579
over a period of 20 years

01:02:47.579 --> 01:02:50.579
and was often met by large crowds.

01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:54.579
Today, people are still seeking truth in Ireland.

01:02:54.579 --> 01:02:56.579
They desire to serve Jehovah

01:02:56.579 --> 01:02:58.579
with their whole heart

01:02:58.579 --> 01:03:00.579
and find a way to symbolize their dedication

01:03:00.579 --> 01:03:04.579
in line with COVID-19 guidelines.

01:03:04.579 --> 01:03:06.579
Our brothers and sisters make efforts

01:03:06.579 --> 01:03:08.579
to reach everyone with the good news,

01:03:08.579 --> 01:03:12.579
including those who speak the traditional Irish language.

01:03:12.579 --> 01:03:14.579
Out of the millions here,

01:03:14.579 --> 01:03:17.579
a relatively small percentage speak Irish

01:03:17.579 --> 01:03:19.579
as their native tongue.

01:03:19.579 --> 01:03:21.579
They're usually found in close-knit communities

01:03:21.579 --> 01:03:24.579
that value traditional culture.

01:03:24.579 --> 01:03:26.579
Despite the challenges,

01:03:26.579 --> 01:03:29.579
local publishers find success preaching.

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:31.579
This includes our brothers and sisters

01:03:31.579 --> 01:03:34.579
in the Castlebar Irish pregroup,

01:03:34.579 --> 01:03:36.579
who were excited to have a share

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:39.579
in the global campaign in November 2020.

01:03:39.579 --> 01:03:41.579
Adding to the excitement,

01:03:41.579 --> 01:03:44.579
the campaign featured the very first

01:03:44.579 --> 01:03:47.579
Irish language watchtower.

01:03:47.579 --> 01:03:50.579
Since young ones are required to learn Irish in school,

01:03:50.579 --> 01:03:53.579
they are eager to apply the language skills

01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:54.579
in the ministry.

01:03:54.579 --> 01:03:57.579
Their enthusiasm spurs others on.

01:03:57.579 --> 01:03:59.579
The brothers and sisters

01:03:59.579 --> 01:04:01.579
in the Castlebar Irish pregroup

01:04:01.579 --> 01:04:03.579
send their love and greetings

01:04:03.579 --> 01:04:05.579
to the worldwide brotherhood.

01:04:05.579 --> 01:04:07.579
From the world headquarters

01:04:07.579 --> 01:04:08.579
of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:11.579
this is JW Broadcasting.
