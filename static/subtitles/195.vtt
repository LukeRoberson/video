00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:10.009
No doubt every one of us at one time or another has faced a discouraging situation.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.009
Really, no one is immune from discouragement.

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:22.609
This feeling may last for a day or two, and then subside, or it might last longer.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.730
What can cause us to be discouraged?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:36.170
We watched our publications index lists over 20 factors that can contribute to discouragement.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.689
Some of these are another's conduct, what someone did or didn't do that disappointed us.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:51.210
Problems in our congregation, feeling inadequate, our own personal failures, what we've done

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.250
or failed to do, health problems, and loss of privileges.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.689
There are ever so many things that can cause us to be downhearted.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.489
Even the fact that we are discouraged can be discouraging.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:13.769
We feel guilty for being discouraged.

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:18.250
Here's the good news, we're in good company.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.969
I'm very prominent and faithful servants of Jehovah mentioned in the Bible have been discouraged.

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:33.250
Moses became so discouraged over the complaints of the Israelites that he said to God,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.969
please kill me right now.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:43.250
Rebecca was so distressed because her son Esau married pagan women.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.849
She told her husband, I said, I am disgusted with my life.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:55.810
Yes, family situations can cause discouragement.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.409
David was tormented by his sins.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:12.330
At Psalm 513, he wrote, I am well aware of my transgressions and my sin is always before me.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.810
Our mistakes can weigh us down.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.169
Jeremiah felt so discouraged by the opposition, ridicule, and apathy he met up with that he

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:32.810
told himself, I'm not going to make mention of Jehovah, and I will speak no more in his name.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.889
Yes, poor results in the ministry can discourage us.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:49.289
The Apostle Paul, frankly admitted in Romans 724 and 25 that he struggled against sinful tendencies.

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:53.689
At times, he felt miserable over this conflict.

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:03.610
He said, miserable man that I am, who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death.

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:11.849
Faithful men and women faced discouraging circumstances in the past and so do we.

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.370
Discouragement is a part of life in this system.

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.050
We should expect it.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.289
Yet it's important to consider how we view discouragement.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:33.129
Do we view ourselves as helpless victims of discouragement and let ourselves sink into a

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:42.490
quagmire of despair and self-pity or do we view discouragement as an enemy that we must fight against?

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:52.250
We easily recognize that feelings of pride, selfishness, envy, and such things are enemies.

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.370
We battle against these bad feelings.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.409
We don't want them to erode our faith or gain a foothold on our personality.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.530
Yet sometimes we may yield all too willingly to discouragement.

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.090
Why is this dangerous?

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.650
Please read with me Proverbs 2410.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.009
If you become discouraged in the day of distress, your strength will be meager.

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:28.970
Did you note the reason why we must fight discouragement?

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:38.329
What do Proverbs 2410 tell us will happen if we allow a day of distress to discourage us?

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:40.889
We'll lose our strength.

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:50.170
Yes, discouragement can drain us of our spiritual, mental, emotional, and even physical strength.

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.050
And what can happen if we lose our strength?

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.250
We can lose our enthusiasm for the truth.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.730
We may lose interest in prayer or in personal study.

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.810
We can slack off in attending meetings.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.089
We can develop coldness toward our brothers.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.089
Our zeal for evangelizing can weaken.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.610
We may even want to give up.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.089
We don't want any of those things to happen to us.

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.889
Do we brothers?

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:29.370
How then do we fight and defeat discouragement?

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.600
Discouragement is a feeling, an emotion.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:38.759
What causes feelings or emotions?

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:45.480
An article entitled Negative Emotions, Can You Overcome Them,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.680
was published in the October 8th, 1992, awake.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:59.000
This article didn't discuss serious cases of depression that may have a medical or physical cause,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
such as a disease, a reaction to toxins, medications, nutritional deficiencies,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.879
allergens, hormonal problems, or bipolar disorder.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:20.600
Rather, it discussed how to overcome moments of discouragement, like the temporary day

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.120
of distress mentioned in Proverbs 2410.

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.399
Under the subheading, we can control our thinking.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:31.399
It stated this.

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.199
Many who work in the field of mental health,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.800
maintain that our feelings are caused by our thoughts.

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:50.519
It's been said that you cannot experience a feeling without first experiencing a thought.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.959
So then, feeling discouraged isn't always the situation that we face,

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:02.519
but the negative thoughts that we have about the situation.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:10.600
The first step then in fighting discouragement is to identify the negative thoughts.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.600
Sometimes we say that we have a train of thought.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.720
It means we have a series of thoughts that lead to a certain conclusion or destination,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.360
if you will.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.560
Now, imagine yourself getting on a literal railroad or subway train.

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.639
Soon you realize you're on the wrong train.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:39.800
It's taking you to a place you do not want to go to.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.000
What do you do?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.199
Do you stay on the train all the way to the wrong destination?

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.839
Of course not.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.480
No, you get off that train at the very next station.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:54.519
But what do you do next?

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.720
You switch to the right train.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:07.240
Now, figuratively speaking, if you realize that your mind is getting on a train of negative thoughts

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.519
as leading to discouragement, can you get off that train?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:17.079
Certainly, but you need to switch to the right train of thought that will lead you

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:21.079
to a peaceful state of mind. That's the key.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.399
We need to replace negative thoughts with positive, upbuilding, spiritual thoughts.

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:36.200
Keeping our thinking on the right track is not going process.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.360
Notice how the Apostle Paul put it in Ephesians 4.23.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:50.679
And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude.

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:56.679
Do you see how Paul confirms that we are in control?

00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:59.879
We can change how we think.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.639
And because we're imperfect, we have to make these changes continuously.

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:14.039
It's not a losing battle. Jehovah has given us powerful weapons to help us make our minds

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:21.399
move in the right direction, his powerful word, his mighty Holy Spirit, the power of prayer,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.879
and healthful spiritual food from his organization.

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:32.600
Let's consider some negative thoughts that may lead to discouragement.

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:39.639
Then we'll consider upbuilding, positive thoughts that help us fight discouragement.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.480
You had a bad day. You said or did the wrong thing and you regret it.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:55.320
It's become a day of distress. The thought enters your mind. I'm worthless.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.919
That's the discouragement train. Will you continue to stay on this train of thought,

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:12.039
taking you to the state of discouragement? Remember, you have a choice. You can reject it.

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:17.480
Instead of giving in to that negative thought, you could say to yourself,

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:27.080
wait a minute, stop. That's not right, just because I made a mistake. Does not make me worthless

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:34.519
in Jehovah's eyes. He's told us that he knows that we are dust and he's merciful.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:42.360
And Jesus said that not one sparrow that has fallen to the ground is forgotten by God.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:52.519
And that we are worth more than many sparrows. Yes, Jehovah views me as precious.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:11:02.919
I'll pray about this and I'm sure he'll help me not to make that mistake again. Tomorrow will be a better day.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:09.450
Thank you, Jehovah. Let's take a second example.

00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:19.129
A brother has said something quite unkind to you. This has become a day of distress.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:27.289
The thought comes to your mind, how can a brother behave like that and still be in good standing?

00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:33.929
He's not a good example. Why don't the elders do something about it?

00:11:35.289 --> 00:11:43.210
Now that discouragement, speaking, calling for us to get on board, if we stay on that negative

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:51.610
train of thought, we could lose our spiritual strength. But we still have a choice.

00:11:52.889 --> 00:12:00.730
Well, we replace those negative thoughts with positive ones. We could get our mind on a positive

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:10.090
track by saying to ourselves something like this. Well, that was an unkind thing for him to say.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:21.690
This is not like him. Maybe my brother just had a bad day. He's as imperfect as I am. I've said

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:28.730
unkind things too at times and have regretted it. He's probably feeling the same way.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:39.370
I remember Colossians 313 says that we must continue putting up with one another and forgiving one

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:49.769
another freely, even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Well, he has given me

00:12:49.769 --> 00:13:01.210
a cause for complaint. But it says Jehovah has freely forgiven us. He has certainly forgiven me

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:08.809
countless times. No, I'm not going to allow this to ruin our relationship.

00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:16.009
How can I help my brother? I'll pray for him. And I'll pray for myself

00:13:16.809 --> 00:13:20.730
that I don't hold feelings of resentment in my heart.

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:30.169
Let's consider a third example. After years of hard work as a place of employment,

00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:36.169
your position has been terminated. You've lost your job. It's a day of distress.

00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:44.169
You're filled with anxious negative thoughts. How will I care for my family? What will the future

00:13:44.169 --> 00:13:55.259
bring? Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to me? Where will this train of dark negative thoughts

00:13:55.259 --> 00:14:03.740
lead you? Certainly, discouragement will set in and you will become spiritually weak and exhausted.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:13.179
You still have a choice. You can replace those negative thoughts with thoughts such as these.

00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:23.740
Okay, I've lost my job. What should I do? Stop serving Jehovah? No. Jesus said that we should not

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:32.299
be anxious over material things because Jehovah will provide if we keep his kingdom first in our lives.

00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:41.419
He also said to keep our lives simple. You know what? There are things that we don't need.

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:50.779
So that's what we do. Simplify our life and do more in Jehovah's service. Jehovah promises never

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:59.740
to abandon us. I'll throw my burden on him and I know he'll help us make the right decisions.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:09.340
Brothers, we're living in the last days of this system of things. We'll have our days of distress.

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:16.299
Sometimes these come because of our own imperfection or the imperfection of others.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.460
But we also realize that the devil wants to discourage us.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:32.220
Revelation 1217 tells us that Satan's great anger is directed toward those who observe the

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:41.419
commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness concerning Jesus. The devil will try to take

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:48.460
advantage of situations and problems that we face to fill us with discouraging thoughts and

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:56.860
drain us of our strength. Now we stand at the very threshold of the new world.

00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:03.179
Let's fight discouragement. With all the weapons Jehovah gives us,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:12.299
continue to steady God's word, making it a part of your daily life. Pray incessantly to Jehovah

00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:22.220
for his powerful spirit. Keep close to his organization. God has promised to give us the victory.

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:29.980
Fearlessly, we join in repeating Paul's words at Philippians 413.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:37.980
For all things, I have the strength through the one who gives me power.
