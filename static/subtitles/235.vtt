00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.099
Welcome to this special update.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:09.900
Pure worship is under attack in the country of Russia.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.399
In this program, we will update you on our efforts to defend God's precious word the Bible

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:20.100
from those who would seek to ban it in Russia.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.000
We will interview a brother who was present in the courtroom for the recent appeal hearing

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.600
regarding the New World translation of the Holy Scriptures.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.200
We will also update you on the court case to seize the property of our branch office in Russia

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.500
and show you what has recently taken place to seize the assembly hall complex in St. Petersburg.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:53.000
As you may be aware, on December 20th, the Leningrad Regional Court denied our appeal of a decision

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.899
to ban the Russian-language New World translation, declaring it an extremist publication.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:11.500
This is against Russian law, specifically according to an amendment to Article 3 of the federal law on extremism

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.799
signed by President Putin himself in the fall of 2015.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:26.500
Quote the Bible, the Koran, the Tanakh, and the Kangir, their contents and quotations from them

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.400
cannot be recognized as extremist materials end of quote.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.599
With such a clear law like that in force, any reasonable person would wonder

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:43.599
how could a Russian court ban a Bible?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.000
We're pleased to have with us brother Moses Agiboy, who was present in the courtroom for the recent appeal hearing.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.500
Moses, it's good to see you. Welcome.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.000
Thank you, Mark. It's the privilege to be with you.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.599
Now, Moses, before we discuss the appeal hearing, could you help us understand

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:09.000
how the proceedings against the New World translation have unfolded up until now?

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:18.599
Yes, Mark. This case began back on August 13, 2015, after a prosecutor filed a claim

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.599
to declare the New World translation in Russian to be extremist.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:30.099
At the beginning of the trial, back then in April 2016, the prosecutor demanded

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:37.900
that the court request an expert study from a panel of experts

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.900
that who have consistently provided biased reports against Jehovah's Witnesses in the past.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.300
Their so-called studies have been refuted by other unbiased scientific experts as well.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.500
Well, the judge then ruled to join the case and allow time for these experts study of the Bible.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:11.400
The study was completed and submitted to the court more than a year later on May 22, 2017.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.900
As expected, the biased study was full of outrageous statements that were not based on the facts.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.400
The study even concluded that the New World translation was not a Bible,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.300
since it did not say Bible on the cover.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:36.300
So, in late July 2017, the court resumed its hearings of the case.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.400
Well, Moses, can you tell us what was it like in the courtroom when the trial resumed in July?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.800
Over a period of four days, there were 30 hours of court hearings.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:05.199
During that time, our attorneys exposed the so-called expert study and its key claims as unfounded, biased, absurd, inconsistent, and invalid.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:11.199
Our attorneys prove that the New World translation is consistent with other Russian Bible translations

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:19.100
by having many verses read in two or more Bible translations for comparison.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.199
In fact, some 25 Bible passages were read in the courtroom.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.000
On one occasion, Mark, the judge selected a verse in the New World translation

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that may have appeared to him as controversial and asked our lawyer to explain it.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.399
Of course, our lawyer simply asked the diverse be read in all three different translations.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:54.800
And after that, they all had the same idea and no further explanation was needed.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.300
One of our attorneys described the scene in the courtroom this way, and I caught him, Mark, if I may.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.800
He said, yesterday, the judge read a great manuscript from various translations of the Bible.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.100
The New World translation, the scene without translation, the modern translation, and others.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.000
Many scriptures were read about family life, raising children, and loving our neighbors.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.300
We read some 23 in three different translations for comparison.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.800
The judge himself read all these scriptures.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:41.899
Just imagine the scene, the courtroom, two prosecutors, three attorneys, and the audience.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
In the center, the table seats the judge with five seven translations of the Bible.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The judge opens the various Bible translations, reads aloud, asks questions.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.500
It was a stunning picture.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.000
It reminded us of a well-prepared Bible study.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Well, that's just incredible, Moses.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.899
Well, what were some of the ways that God's Word was attacked during this hearing?

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:14.399
And how did our brothers put up a defense for the Bible?

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:22.410
Yes, the so-called experts attacked the use of God's holy name, Jehovah, in the New World translation.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:33.509
The expert study states in the New World translation of the Holy Scriptures, the dominant factor of the text is the Jehovah concept.

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:40.610
The Jehovah concept expresses a personified God with such names as Jehovah God,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:47.310
Jehovah of Armies, the King, Jehovah of Armies, the Holy One of Israel, etc.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:55.310
Thus, in the opinion of Jehovah's Witnesses, he has the personal name Jehovah.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.509
So the New World translation of the Holy Scriptures does not qualify as a Christian Bible,

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:05.509
but is an independent text and of court.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:14.810
So in order to expose this attack, the lawyers introduced to the court 10 other Russian Bibles that used the name Jehovah.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:28.610
They also showed the court poetry by renowned Russian poets as Setyev and Pushkin and books by Kuprin, Gancherov and Dastoyevsky

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:34.410
and excerpts from other classic Russian literature where the name Jehovah is used.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:50.009
They also pointed to the 19th century Russian language, Makarius Bible, produced by Russian authorless church translators in which the name Jehovah occurs more than 3,500 times.

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:56.910
Moses, it's so good to hear that the brothers were able to defend Jehovah's holy name in the courtroom.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:04.910
Well, were the brothers able to interview any experts who could also defend God's name, defend the Bible?

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:11.110
Yes, Mark. The court allowed the two experts to present testimony.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:21.410
Regarding the user God's name, Professor Mikhail Adinsov, a religious scholar, where respected in Russia, who is not one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:40.210
a confirmed in front of the court that the name Jehovah has been used by other Russian translations and translators as well, including the translators of the official Bible translation of the Russian authorless church, where the divine name Jehovah occurs some 10 times.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:49.009
Professor Adinsov read two verses from the church Bible that contained God's personal name, Jehovah.

00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:59.610
He also mentioned two authorless church translators, namely Pafsky and Makarius, who both use God's name Jehovah extensively in their translations.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:15.210
Professor Adinsov gave a thorough explanation regarding the history and meaning of the name Jehovah as well as the long history of its use in Bible translation and in the literature of Christendom.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:23.009
Thus, he completely refuted their attack on Jehovah's name and the New World translation.

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:28.409
Excellent. Well, what a powerful defense for God's name, Jehovah.

00:09:28.409 --> 00:09:40.610
Now, didn't you also say Moses that these so-called experts had said that the New World translation was not a Bible because the word Bible did not appear on the cover?

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:51.610
Yes, Mark. That's right. The study also claimed that the New World translation is not a Bible because it does not expressly say that it is a Bible.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:10:08.009
However, Professor Adinsov explained to the court that in line with scientific criteria, the words scriptures and holy scriptures are quite appropriate to describe the Bible.

00:10:08.009 --> 00:10:36.009
In addition, our lawyers explained to the court that they were amazed that the court appointed so-called experts claimed to have worked for 287 days on their research and yet missed the simple fact that on the third paragraph of the Bible's forward on page five, it clearly states this new translation of the Bible.

00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:47.009
Well, that's just unbelievable, Moses. What other arguments did these so-called experts try to use against God's word the Bible?

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:56.009
Well, the expert study also claimed that Jehovah's Witnesses do not recognize Jesus Christ as the Savior of mankind.

00:10:56.009 --> 00:11:07.009
But the first paragraph of the forward to the New World translation Russian edition says exactly the opposite and quotes John 316.

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:20.009
The experts also claimed that the New World translation is not a Bible because it allegedly has been modified to refute the doctrine of the Trinity.

00:11:20.009 --> 00:11:28.009
Yet, our lawyers read from the Russian author of the Church Synod of Version, two verses from that translation.

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:41.009
First Corinthians 113, where he says, the head of the Christ is God and John 1428, where Christ Jesus said, for the Father is greater than I am.

00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:50.009
So these two verses show that the official Russian author of the Church Bible also refutes the Trinity doctrine.

00:11:50.009 --> 00:12:02.009
We could go on and on, Mark, but the fact is that the lower court ruled to ban the New World translation and so we appeared to a higher court.

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:09.009
And the appeal hearing was held on December 20th, 2017, as you rightly said in the beginning.

00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:18.009
Well, Moses, could you tell us a little bit about the appeal hearing that took place in December? I know you were in the courtroom. What was it like?

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:32.009
As during the first trials, foreign diplomats from at least four nations, Britain, Netherlands, Switzerland, United States attended the December 20th, 2017, appeal hearing.

00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:40.009
Again, there were many brothers and sisters present in the courtroom, because they cared so much about the New World translation.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:51.009
At the appeal hearing, when none of the three so-called experts could explain the methods they used to carry out their study,

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:57.009
the court itself intervened and ended the questioning of the experts.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:13:16.009
In fact, Mrs. Crickover, one of the three experts who made a very revealing statement when she said that the only book that can be called a Bible is one approved by the Russian author of the Church.

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:26.009
And that is marked by the blessing of the patriarch, or that march is word-for-word with such a translation.

00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:38.009
When asked, Mrs. Crickover refused to state why she believed that the New World translation is extremist, calling this a legal question.

00:13:38.009 --> 00:13:52.009
So you see, Mark, neither the prosecutors, nor the so-called experts, who were questioned, could cite even one verse as an example of extremism in the New World translation Bible.

00:13:52.009 --> 00:14:01.009
Thus, again and again, our attorneys exposed that they outstridged and false claims of these so-called experts.

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:21.009
Our attorneys presented a total of 35 scholarly documents containing overwhelming evidence to prove that the New World translation Bible is truly the word of God, but these were all ignored by the court.

00:14:21.009 --> 00:14:31.009
So again and again, we had the impression sitting there in the court remark that the purpose of the hearing was not to find out the facts or evidence, etc.

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:40.009
But rather, to go through the legal formalities quickly since the decision had already been made and must be announced today.

00:14:41.009 --> 00:14:55.009
In fact, the judges deliberated on the seven hours of testimony for only four minutes before announcing their decision to ban the New World translation.

00:14:56.009 --> 00:15:09.009
Well, Moses, thank you so much for sharing this powerful defense that our brothers made in behalf of Jehovah's Holy Name and his precious word, the Bible. We appreciate this report so much.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:16.009
Thank you, Mark. It was a privilege to be there with the brothers in the courtroom in St. Petersburg.

00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:29.009
The attack on pure worship in Russia includes an outright ban on our activities in that land. Now the authorities are moving forward in seizing properties owned by Jehovah's people.

00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:43.009
For example, on December 7th, 2017, a hearing was held in the Cestoraretsk District Court regarding the seizing of the Russia branch property at Solnitschnaya.

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:56.009
Brother Richard Devine, a member of the Board of Directors of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania, had the privilege of being in attendance at the hearing. Richard, it's good to see you. Welcome.

00:15:56.009 --> 00:16:06.009
Thank you, Mark. It's a pleasure to be here. Could you tell us a little bit about the nature of this hearing that you went to Russia to attend? Sure.

00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:17.009
When the administrative center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia was declared extremist late last year by the courts, it gave the government the ability to seize the administration center's property.

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:28.009
However, when they tried to seize the Bethel Complex, they found out that it legally belonged not to the administrative center, but actually to the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania.

00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:41.009
And that for 17 years, the administrative center had merely been a tenant. Since the Pennsylvania Corporation hadn't been banned, this created a legal obstacle for the government in seizing our property.

00:16:41.009 --> 00:17:05.009
So what argument did the government use to try to justify the seizure of the branch property? Well, the government was trying to prove that the transfer of title to the property to the Pennsylvania Corporation 17 years ago wasn't valid, and that the Bethel property still really belonged to the administrative center, and therefore it was fair game for them to seize.

00:17:06.009 --> 00:17:13.009
Richard, can you tell us what was it like to be there in the courtroom for this very historic hearing?

00:17:13.009 --> 00:17:25.009
Well, a couple of things really impressed me very much, and one was the courage of the local brothers and sisters who came to the hearing despite the ban just to support the brothers presenting our case.

00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:30.009
It was truly a remarkable demonstration of strong faith and determination.

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:41.009
The hearing was held in a small drab room in Sester, O.S., a town not far from the former Bethel facility. There was barely room for everyone to fit inside.

00:17:41.009 --> 00:17:47.009
Our attorneys and the prosecutors were literally two feet apart, facing each other over a small table.

00:17:47.009 --> 00:17:56.009
The brothers and sisters crammed in any space they could find. Some even sitting inside the barred cell reserved for criminal defendants.

00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:03.009
Now, Richard, what can you tell us about the hearing itself? What actually took place in the courtroom?

00:18:03.009 --> 00:18:11.009
Well, I knew from meeting with them the night before how well our attorneys prepared for this case and how hard they worked on it.

00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:20.009
And to see them both want a relatively young brother courageously stand up and defend the interests of Jehovah's people, it was really an amazing sight.

00:18:21.009 --> 00:18:37.009
They had real conviction and passion. They demonstrated unequivocally that according to Russian law, the international business law and the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, that they were squarely in our favor.

00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:43.009
And that to seize our property was not only legally wrong, but it was really morally wrong.

00:18:43.009 --> 00:18:55.009
The prosecutors, on the other hand, appeared to be not long out of high school, limited themselves to reading a few short pre-written statements and asked no questions during the hearing.

00:18:55.009 --> 00:19:02.009
Well, now, Richard, what was it like when the decision was finally read in the courtroom?

00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:11.009
Well, I don't think the decision was really a surprise to anyone. However, it seemed to me that the judge was very uncomfortable reading that verdict.

00:19:11.009 --> 00:19:15.009
At the end, she announced that there would be 30 days to file an appeal.

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:20.009
Now, the spirit of the brothers and sisters leaving the courtroom was somber at first.

00:19:20.009 --> 00:19:28.009
But once we were out in the hallway, the conversations got going. The brothers and sisters began congratulating the attorneys for the fine witness they had given.

00:19:28.009 --> 00:19:38.009
Once again, they were all smiling, laughing, hugging, even giving little gifts to one another. They were once again just happy to be together serving Jehovah.

00:19:38.009 --> 00:19:42.009
Well, then, what happens now? Where do we go from here, Richard?

00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:47.009
Well, the brothers are planning to file an appeal within the given time.

00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:54.009
And if this first appeal goes against us, then the property will be seized by the government and used for other purposes.

00:19:54.009 --> 00:20:02.009
However, further appeals, possibly even to the European Court of Human Rights, will be pursued.

00:20:02.009 --> 00:20:14.009
Richard, thank you very, very much for giving us that report. And even more, we want to thank you for the courage that you demonstrated in going to Russia to stand with our brothers during that hearing.

00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:17.009
It really was my privilege. Thank you.

00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:22.009
However, the seizure of our other properties has already begun in Russia.

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:37.009
For example, on December 14, 2017, just after 9 a.m. in the morning, about 40 people, including police and others, appeared outside the assembly hall of Jehovah's Witnesses in St. Petersburg.

00:20:37.009 --> 00:20:46.009
Some of the men were armed with automatic weapons, and others had the tools needed to forcibly enter the locked assembly hall compound.

00:20:47.009 --> 00:20:52.009
Thankfully, none of our brothers were inside the assembly hall during this raid.

00:20:52.009 --> 00:21:07.009
Russian news agencies have reported that based on the Russian Supreme Court ruling earlier this year, the government has seized the property and has transferred it to the neighboring medical center for use as a lecture hall.

00:21:07.009 --> 00:21:11.009
They have already posted a new sign on the gate.

00:21:11.009 --> 00:21:23.009
In addition to these actions, you may be wondering about our brother Dennis Christensen, who has been in pretrial detention since May 25, 2017.

00:21:23.009 --> 00:21:40.009
The court has extended his pretrial detention several times. Most recently, on December 22, 2017, the court extended his detention until February 23, 2018.

00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:46.009
The authorities are allowing Brother Christensen's wife to visit him now twice a month.

00:21:46.009 --> 00:21:52.009
We expect that his trial will begin sometime in the coming weeks.

00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:59.009
What can we say, brothers, about this attack on pure worship in Russia?

00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:12.009
Jehovah foretold that during Christ's presence, the kings of the earth and high officials would take their stand against Jehovah and his anointed one.

00:22:12.009 --> 00:22:17.009
We find that in Psalm 2 verses 1 to 3.

00:22:17.009 --> 00:22:30.009
Thus, we are not surprised to see this direct attack on Jehovah's name, his precious word, the Bible, and his faithful worshipers on this earth.

00:22:30.009 --> 00:22:41.009
We must keep in our minds the warning from our Lord Jesus when He said at Matthew chapter 10 and verse 17,

00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:51.009
Be on your guard against men, for they will hand you over to local courts and they will scourge you in their synagogues.

00:22:51.009 --> 00:23:00.009
And you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and to the nations.

00:23:00.009 --> 00:23:13.009
However, when they hand you over, do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak, for what you are to speak will be given you in that hour.

00:23:13.009 --> 00:23:22.009
For the one speaking are not just you, but it is the spirit of your father that speaks by you.

00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:34.009
Further, brother will hand brother over to death and a father, his child and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death.

00:23:34.009 --> 00:23:47.009
And you will be hated by all people on account of my name, but the one who has endured to the end will be saved.

00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:55.009
Yes, as Jesus said, all who endure faithfully will ultimately be saved.

00:23:55.009 --> 00:24:01.009
Jehovah stated through his prophet at Ezekiel 39 verse 7,

00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:07.009
The nations will have to know that I am Jehovah.

00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:16.009
Soon, Jehovah will act in behalf of all his servants who, despite opposition and adverse circumstances,

00:24:16.009 --> 00:24:22.009
prove that they are truly a people for his name.

00:24:22.009 --> 00:24:28.009
