00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.779
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.140
In this update, I thought we might reflect on Jehovah's goodness and the way he's been

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.820
guiding his people during the pandemic.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.019
I'm sure we all agree with the words of the Psalmist found at Psalm 27 and verse 13,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:28.219
where would I be if I did not have faith that I would see Jehovah's goodness in the land

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:29.739
of the living?

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.899
Where would I be?

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.380
That's something to think about, isn't it?

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.460
How grateful we are to be associated with Jehovah's organization and to benefit from

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.340
its direction and guidance, especially when we see where we could be in the confused

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.299
and divided world around us.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:56.619
With your eyes of faith, do you see Jehovah as directing his people today?

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.100
Now, we know he's interested in our spiritual well-being, but what about our physical

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.620
well-being, our health?

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.780
Does he care about that?

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.219
If he does, will he make sure that we get good advice, even on health matters?

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.819
To answer that, let's consider the promised Jehovah made as found at Psalm 32 and verse 8.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.819
This is one we know well, but let's look at this from another perspective.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.819
This is Psalm 32 and verse 8.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.700
He says, I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.420
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.620
So here's a promise, the Jehovah will give us the advice we need,

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.260
but advice on what subject?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.299
Think back to the days of Israel.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.180
Was Jehovah interested in the health and safety of his people back then?

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.420
He certainly was.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.780
He instructed the Israelites to quarantine the sick.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.939
He told them not to eat unclean birds and animals because doing so could have been harmful

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:19.180
for their health, and he insisted that they build a parapet around the flat roof of their homes

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.860
so no one would fall off. He loved his people.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.460
He wanted them to be safe. Jehovah hasn't changed.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.539
He still cares about the health and safety of his people.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:40.300
Knowing the Psalm we just read, he promised to give us insight, instruction, and advice.

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.419
How does he do that today?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.060
He does it by means of his organization.

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:55.819
In some countries, there's been considerable confusion and disagreement over how to deal with the

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.500
pandemic. Some chafe at the idea of wearing masks and they refuse to practice physical distancing

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.659
even when these precautions are required.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.180
A reminder to Paul's words at 1 Corinthians 14 and 33.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.620
Remember that one?

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.979
God is not a God of disorder, but of peace the Bible says.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.300
The disorder we see in the world is proof positive that Jehovah is not with them.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.379
But from Jehovah's organization, we've had clear direction from the very beginning,

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.020
and we thank Jehovah for it.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.060
For example, think of the information we've received through recent governing body updates.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.780
This is evidence of Jehovah's loving direction, his goodness.

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.379
In last month's update, Brother Lat made a very important point.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.979
He reminded us that the information we're receiving regarding the pandemic

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.180
is prepared by faithful brothers. We can trust them.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.139
They aren't motivated by some personal view or political agenda.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.139
They love us. They want the best for us.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.219
I hear someone ask, what do they know?

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:14.379
Wrong question.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.939
I think the right question is, what does Jehovah know?

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.139
It comes down to this, friends.

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:27.980
Do I really believe that Jehovah is directing this organization today?

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.180
Do I believe that Jehovah will give insight to his faithful people so they can remain in the land

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.019
of the living, as the Psalmist said?

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:43.819
To repeat the question we often raise in field service, does God really care?

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.990
Would Jehovah allow the governing body, the helpers, missionaries,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.670
huge percentage of the worldwide Bethel family and other full-time servants to engage in practices

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.189
or receive a COVID-19 vaccine that would be harmful?

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.350
Surely, Jehovah wants the brothers at World Headquarters to continue providing

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.629
spiritual food. He wants to make sure that the work continues at our branch offices

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:17.389
and in the field. To do that, we have to be in the land of the living.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:24.269
And what about the prophecy that a great crowd, which no man can number, will come out of the

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:31.069
great tribulation? Our God is definitely not like Pharaoh, who wanted to kill off an entire

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:38.750
generation of Jehovah's worshipers. We are convinced that Jehovah cares about the health

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.310
and safety of his people, and that he will guide us, saying in effect,

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:52.019
this is the way, walk in it, your people. When we embark on a certain course,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.620
we always look for evidence of Jehovah's blessing to see whether we're on the right track or not.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.540
So, has Jehovah blessed our efforts during this pandemic?

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.300
Yes, indeed. Well, of course, the pandemic has slowed activities for many of our brothers,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.420
especially in areas without good internet connections. Think of everything you've accomplished

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.899
in recent months. Many congregations are reporting record attendances at our virtual congregation

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:28.100
meetings. Inactive ones are returning to Jehovah and how we thank God for that.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:40.500
Our memorial attendance for 2021 reached an all-time peak of 21,367,603.

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:46.100
And many branches have reported new all-time peaks in the number of publishers.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.379
But that's not all. You've shown exemplary concern and

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:57.620
brotherly affection for one another, proving that you truly are Christ's disciples.

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:06.019
We commend you most warmly. Who can deny that Jehovah is blessing your work?

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:13.220
And consider what the Bethel family has been able to accomplish during the pandemic,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.980
only with Jehovah's blessing. We all appreciate our beautiful new publication and joy life

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.980
forever. That was a tremendous amount of work involving hundreds of hours of overtime.

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:31.379
But that's not all that was accomplished during the pandemic. What about the monthly broadcasts?

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:39.779
We never missed one. Then there are the beautiful videos, our regional conventions, the Gilead

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:46.980
graduations, and the annual meetings. All of this was possible because the Bethel family

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:54.180
stayed healthy.
