00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:41.490
From 1999 to the present, we have greatly diminished the number of products that we transfuse.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.689
Can we do better?

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:43.689
Absolutely.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:47.570
There are many centers that still transfuse too much.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.409
Our surgeons got incredibly fantastic about doing procedures differently, advanced technology

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.570
to do procedures that now didn't require blood transfusion.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.810
All of this has benefited the vast majority of patients in not just the individuals of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.890
religious beliefs who don't want to be transfused, but also patients who we recognize that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.450
transfusion may not be the right answer to their problem.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.489
In 2008, we were using 18,000 red cells per year, and we now are just sneaking under

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:17.489
10,000.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.769
So it's a dramatic reduction in the amount of blood that was transfused.

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:25.409
We can easily identify anemia before the start of the surgery.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.329
And sure that it is well treated without blood products right from the start.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:40.430
And afterwards, potentially go through the surgery without transfusion.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.829
The key to managing witness patients who are pregnant is planning.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:51.590
It's crucial, and you can't really take care of any patient, but particularly a witness

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.230
patient without a plan.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.950
You know, they have pregnancies like anyone else.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.390
So they're not particularly at risk.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.549
On my birthing record, I put it in big, and it's on the top of the paper.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.509
And I want people to understand that these are the wishes of the patient.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.750
Be aware of it.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.270
Be sensitive to it and be prepared to deal very quickly if there's any concern of blood

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.270
loss or developing or evolving postpartum hemorrhage or hemorrhage at any point in the delivery

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.270
process.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.270
And you've blood's not an option, obviously, we have to get more creative.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.830
If we have a Jehovah's Witness patient that's coming in to deliver often percent patients

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.270
that are very complex, they may have some risk factors for having a major postpartum

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.590
hemorrhage identified before they deliver.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.909
We have a case conference with everybody involved in the care of that patient, and we come

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.430
up with a strategy of what we do before, what we do during delivery, and what we're going

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.949
to do after.

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:57.669
And it's a multifaceted, multidisciplinary team approach to managing those patients.

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.430
We just have everything ready to go.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.229
We embrace the idea that we should treat respectfully the wishes of the Jehovah's Witness patients.

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:14.229
There's actually a bit of controversy about whether or not patient blood management improves

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:19.030
patient outcomes, but there are some pretty large studies from the United States in cardiac

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.870
surgery, particularly showing that the outcomes are at least as good.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.110
And possibly better with patient blood management.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.229
So certainly, there's no harm in trying to use a blood avoidance strategy.

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:35.909
They have not found that there to be any difference in the outcome of witness patients

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.909
and non-witness patients.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.909
There was absolutely no reason to be afraid of the surgery and a witness patient.

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.550
In my experience is that the result are the same.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:56.909
This the other day, I was doing a fairly complex patient, a complex operation in a Jehovah's

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.669
Witness patient, and something that's not really been described very frequently where we

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.189
actually cool the patient down.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.990
We actually sanguine the patient into a moving circuit in order to see the operative

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.629
feel in a very clear area.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.750
I mean, that's a pretty massive shifting of volume, and we were able to do it in a blood

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.949
manner in terms of transfusions.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.790
So I think we embrace the fact that there are many complex cases we can do.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.829
I've only had positive experience.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:28.470
I haven't had negative experiences.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.670
I think the biggest part is communication.
