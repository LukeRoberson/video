00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:16.760
Peace must be sought above all our military forces are committed to peace. We have chosen peace. Our wish, our prayer is for peace.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:25.859
We yearn for peace. We pray for peace.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:36.079
For thousands of years humans have tried to find peace.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:49.960
Peace is individuals. Peace is families. Peace for the entire human race.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.539
We want to lay the foundation of peace for generations to come. We want to do the hard work now.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.620
So our children and our grandchildren can grow up in a peaceful world.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:20.540
The future we want, opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.780
All that is within our reach.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:02:00.859
Yet despite humans' best efforts, peace has been elusive.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:11.860
For millenniums, rulers and governments have tried to achieve peace through treaties, resolutions, summits and ironically war.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:26.110
Our peace as humans is more fragile than ever.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.110
Man's efforts to bring about lasting peace have failed. Time and time again.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:44.110
This isn't surprising to us. Jeremiah 1023 tells us it does not belong to man to direct his step.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.110
Humans were simply not designed to rule themselves.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:03:00.110
Good health, safety, overall well-being, these are becoming harder to find as we move further into what the Bible refers to as the last days.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.110
As long as human rule continues, disunity will continue.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.110
It's true that global peace cannot be obtained by human efforts alone.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.110
But those who are close to God can find peace of mind right now.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.110
Isaiah 48 17 and 18 says,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.110
I Jehovah, am your God.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.110
The one teaching you to benefit yourself, the one guiding you and the way you should walk.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.110
If only you would pay attention to my commandments.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.110
Then your peace would become just like a river.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.110
It's only Jehovah who has the ability to guide humans to real lasting peace.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.110
He promises he will bring this about until this happens.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.110
Jehovah continues to provide ways for us to experience peace now. How does he do that?

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.110
By giving us the peace of God, that surpasses all understanding.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:15.479
We aren't the only ones whose peace has been challenged.

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:23.480
God's Word is filled with accounts of faithful servants, whose peace was challenged by the dominating forces of their day.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.480
As we study and meditate on these accounts,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:34.480
the lessons we learn from them help us to trust in Jehovah as he guides us to peace.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.480
Understanding how these accounts related Jehovah's purpose to bring peace,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.480
by means of his Messianic Kingdom, gives us confidence that his purpose never fails

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.480
and he will support and guide us on into the future.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.480
One of Jehovah's prophets who learned this lesson firsthand was Jonah.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.480
Jonah lived in the 9th century BCE.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.480
Jehovah signed Jonah to go to Nineveh, a city of the Assyrian Empire.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.480
Based on what he knew about Nineveh, Jonah considered this to be an intimidating and threatening assignment.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:18.480
The Assyrians are known as fierce warriors, and Nineveh itself is later described as a city of bloodshed.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:27.480
So you can understand Jonah's trepidation when Jehovah asks him to proclaim a judgment message against this imposing city and its pagan inhabitants.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:40.220
In an attempt to find peace, Jonah decides to go far away from Nineveh and boards a boat headed for Tarshish.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:48.730
Tarshish is generally associated with modern-day Spain.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.730
So from Israel, this is the complete opposite direction of Nineveh.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:06.589
Jonah found anything but peace.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.040
Now this was no ordinary storm.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.040
It was so severe that the ship was in danger of being wrecked.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:46.620
The crew cried out to their gods, but Jonah knew the true source of the storm.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.620
And now he accepts personal responsibility for the situation.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.620
Lift me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will calm down for you.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:03.259
But I know that it's because of me that this violent storm has come upon you.

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:09.259
Can you imagine the courage it took for Jonah to make this request?

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:27.779
He had no way of knowing if Jehovah would save him, but he did not want others to perish on his account.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:31.779
In his mercy, Jehovah spares Jonah's life.

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:33.779
I must alive.

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:36.779
What will be called of me?

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:44.779
When faced with a difficult assignment, Jonah got up to run away from Jehovah to Tarshish.

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:50.779
Jonah's conscience had to bother him. He had to be questioning his decision.

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:55.779
He tried to take matters into his own hands, tried to find his own peace.

00:07:55.779 --> 00:08:00.779
Where does he find himself in the belly of a fish?

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:03.779
Yet he calls to Jehovah in a moment of despair.

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:15.339
Oh, Jehovah, out of the depths of the grave, I cry to you for help.

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:24.089
He's here, my voice. When I abound, I will pay.

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:34.409
Jonah could have reasoned that this was the end of his assignment as Jehovah's Prophet.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.409
After all, he did disobey direction.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:44.409
So likely he was surprised to hear the word of Jehovah come to him a second time.

00:08:44.409 --> 00:09:05.779
Go to Nine of the Great City and proclaim to her the message that I tell you.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:09.779
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:23.919
At first, Jonah trusted in himself and didn't understand that Jehovah would protect him from the violent assyrians.

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:26.919
But after being given a second chance, what happens?

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:33.919
Well, then he puts aside his human concerns and looks to Jehovah for protection.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:48.019
In just 40 days more, Nineveh will be overthrown.

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:53.019
Jehovah, the true God has spoken, this city will be destroyed.

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:56.019
Nineveh will be overthrown.

00:09:56.019 --> 00:09:59.019
True God will overthrow Nineveh.

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:09.759
Eventually, the king himself repents and orders everyone to Nineveh to do the same.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:14.759
Jonah learned a valuable lesson from this experience.

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:23.759
By recently running away from Nineveh, he chose to trust in himself rather than putting his trust in Jehovah.

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:30.740
Are you Jonah? Mommy says he saved us.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:39.440
No, Jehovah saved you. I was just a messenger.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:47.039
Jonah learned that without a doubt, Jehovah protects those who trust and obey him.

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:58.039
If Jehovah has asked you to do something, if he's asked me to do something, if he's leading us, he absolutely will guide us through it.

00:10:58.039 --> 00:11:01.039
Jonah's account proves this.

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:07.039
Although the Ninevehs were spared because they repented, that's true.

00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:12.039
Aceria later returned to its evil wicked ways.

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:18.039
About a century after Jonah's judgment message, King Sanakarab of Assyria,

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:24.039
brought his armies against the cities of Judah, including the city he wanted most.

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:27.350
Jerusalem.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:33.350
King Hezekiah of Judah was an outstanding king who held fast to Jehovah.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:41.350
From the beginning of his reign, he proved to be zealous for true worship, not only in Judah, but in all of Israel.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.350
Hezekiah had done so much to stand up for pure worship.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:55.740
Yet now he is faced with the prospect of a siege against Jerusalem by Sanakarab's armies.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.740
Hezekiah agrees to pay Sanakarab a tribute in return for peace.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:11.509
The armies continue their conquests, as Sanakarab and his men besieged the strongly fortified city of Lakeish.

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:20.509
From here, Sanakarab sends a part of his army, as well as military chiefs to Jerusalem in an attempt to demand surrender.

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:25.509
The spokesman for the group was the Rapshaqah, who spoke Hebrew fluently.

00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:30.509
He loudly ridiculed Hezekiah and taunted Jehovah,

00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:35.509
boasting that Jehovah was no match against King Sanakarab.

00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:38.509
Imagine what these soldiers must have been thinking.

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:43.509
Sanakarab's armies were on a war path, taking city after city.

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:48.889
To Hezekiah, this was a defining moment.

00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:53.889
He had to decide if he would trust in himself or trust in Jehovah.

00:12:53.889 --> 00:13:04.879
My brothers, we must remember that Jehovah is fully able to rescue us just as he has in times past.

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:12.149
We are not even now face the facts.

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:14.149
We are trapped.

00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:19.149
These Syrians are at our gate, and you cling to the belief that nothing bad will happen.

00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:23.149
You will destroy everything you so hope to preserve.

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:26.149
The Temple of Jerusalem, our very lives.

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:29.149
I am not blind to the dangers that we face.

00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:31.149
I too am afraid.

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:35.149
But if Jehovah allows Jerusalem to fall so be it.

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:38.149
How can we give up what belongs to Jehovah?

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:41.500
So as a man of faith,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.500
Hezekiah focused on Jehovah's ability to save his people

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.500
despite Sanakarab's continued advances toward Jerusalem.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.629
I'm curious about this.

00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:57.629
The King of yours.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:00.629
What does he think will come to save him from me?

00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:05.620
Jehovah, your God.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.620
Is weak!

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.620
He will cringe before my God, Asher.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:20.149
Hezekiah remained determined to trust in Jehovah.

00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:25.149
This decision required a tremendous amount of faith,

00:14:25.149 --> 00:14:33.149
especially with more than 185,000 Assyrian soldiers headed towards Jerusalem.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.330
Instead of trusting in Himself,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:45.330
He continued to look for Jehovah as the source of true peace,

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.330
even as an attack seemed imminent.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:15:02.509
And Jehovah again showed just how insignificant human rulers are in comparison to Him.

00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:24.889
Hezekiah learned that when a way out seems impossible,

00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:28.889
trust in Jehovah always leads to success.

00:15:28.889 --> 00:15:32.889
Jehovah rewarded that trust with victory over the Assyrians.

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:37.889
This is a lesson we can apply now and in the near future.

00:15:37.889 --> 00:15:41.889
There may be situations where true worshipers seem trapped.

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:45.889
But never forget, Jehovah is all-powerful.

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:47.889
He's leading His people,

00:15:47.889 --> 00:15:50.889
and we can follow His guidance with full confidence.

00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:55.889
Jehovah will protect those who trust in Him at Armageddon.

00:15:55.889 --> 00:16:00.889
Jerusalem remains safe against attack for the time being.

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:06.490
But peaceful conditions didn't last long.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:11.490
Asakiah's son, Menasa, did what was detestable in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:17.490
He brought back veil worship and personally took its vileist practices to extremes,

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:22.490
even putting a carved image of a false god right inside Jehovah's Temple.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.490
So here you have a king,

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:28.490
who's supposed to be protecting the people from idolatrous influence,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.490
doing the exact opposite, building altars to false gods.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.490
He even went so far as to pass His own sons through the fire,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.490
sacrificing them to these gods.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:43.490
The peace with God that Hezekiah worked so hard to achieve for the nation

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.490
is now reversed by the actions of His Son.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.490
Because of this, Jehovah punished Menasa severely.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.490
He allowed the king of Assyria to take him captive to Babylon.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:00.490
While in captivity, Menasa ultimately repented.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.490
He humbled himself, and he stayed faithful right to the end of his life.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.490
Grandfather.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.490
We can imagine him impressing the importance of faithfulness to Jehovah

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.490
on his young grandson, Josiah.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:19.930
Listen to me, Jehovah is holy,

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:25.930
and you must serve him the way he wants us to,

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:31.819
all other gods, a powerless.

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:34.819
Yet in spite of all this,

00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:39.819
the people still thought that they could serve Jehovah AND bail.

00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:41.819
So after becoming king,

00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:45.819
Josiah started a campaign against idolatry.

00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:47.819
I've seen this cheaper.

00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:58.970
I think I'll leave it.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:59.970
We start here.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:18.769
We will do to every false god in the land.

00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:24.490
He tore down altars used for false worship,

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.490
sacred polls, images, and statues.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.490
He was intent on cleansing the land of idolatry.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:35.490
He showed remarkable courage to stand up for true worship

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.490
at a time when few were doing so.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.490
There's no doubt this was a difficult task.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.490
At times, he may have even wondered if he was doing the right thing.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.490
It's possible,

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:54.440
Jehovah provided Josiah with assurance from the Prophet Jeremiah.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.440
This is what Jehovah says.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.440
Look,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.440
a son named Josiah will be born

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.440
to the house of David.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.440
And he will sacrifice on you,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.440
the priests of the high places.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.440
Those making sacrificial smoke on you?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.440
And he will burn human bones on you.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:21.549
That prophecy made over 300 years earlier confirmed

00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:26.549
that Josiah was the one prophesied to act against false worship.

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:30.549
This may have given Josiah even greater incentive

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:32.549
and courage to continue his campaign,

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:35.549
which now included repairing the temple.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:39.549
These actions contributed to the peaceful conditions

00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:43.549
that elevated pure worship.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:46.549
Josiah did so much to restore pure worship.

00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:48.549
That is why we love him.

00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:51.549
Yet the people's heart condition remained polluted,

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:55.549
so the nation required severe discipline.

00:19:55.549 --> 00:20:00.549
Jeremiah prophesied a conquest of the Babylonians against Judah.

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:04.549
All this land will be reduced to ruins.

00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:08.549
And this land and its inhabitants will have to serve the king of Babylon

00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:10.549
for 70 years.

00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:14.549
Daniel himself may have heard Jeremiah speak those words.

00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:16.549
And he certainly saw it come true

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:20.900
as he and his family were exiled to Babylon.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.900
Talk about peace being interrupted.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.900
Daniel was a young Judean prince

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:31.619
taken from his homeland, separated from his family.

00:20:31.619 --> 00:20:34.619
But being chosen to receive special training

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:36.619
in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar,

00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:39.619
that presented another set of challenges.

00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:42.619
The entire way of Babylonian life was contrary

00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:45.619
to what Daniel knew growing up in Judah.

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:48.619
But Daniel was determined not to pollute himself

00:20:48.619 --> 00:20:52.619
with foods Jehovah would not approve of.

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:57.410
And Jehovah blessed Daniel's determination to be faithful

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:02.410
as he was selected to serve as one of King Nebuchadnezzar's wise men.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:12.410
Nebuchadnezzar was a warrior king

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.410
intent on building a great empire.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.410
After he officially took the throne in 624 BCE,

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.410
his domain grew with each conquest.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:29.359
Babylon became an epicenter of trade and commerce.

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:32.359
Nebuchadnezzar undertook huge building projects throughout the city,

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:36.359
which made the city seem impregnable.

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:38.359
Imagine the sense of security,

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:41.359
the inhabitants of Babylon must have felt

00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:45.930
locked safely behind the city's walls.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.930
Nebuchadnezzar attributed the prosperity and security

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.930
all around him to the power of his false gods.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.930
The chief of these false gods was Marduk, the god of war.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:03.500
Yet these false gods and their priests would prove worthless.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.500
One night, King Nebuchadnezzar had a strange dream.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:23.140
Okay, may you live on forever.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.140
Relate the dream to your service.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.140
We will tell the interpretation.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.140
If you don't make the dream known to me,

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.140
along with the interpretation,

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.140
you'll be dismembered.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.140
And your houses will be turned to public latrines.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:40.140
There is not a man on earth who can do with the King demands.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.140
What the King is asking is difficult.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:47.140
No one exists and tell this to the King except the gods.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:54.349
Seize them.

00:22:54.349 --> 00:22:59.809
Kill them!

00:22:59.809 --> 00:23:00.809
Kira.

00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:01.809
You're in danger.

00:23:01.809 --> 00:23:02.809
Why what happened?

00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:03.809
He hears.

00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:05.809
But the wise men angered the King.

00:23:05.809 --> 00:23:08.809
I have no evidence to be executed by dawn.

00:23:08.809 --> 00:23:11.809
Bring Hanna and I, Michelle, and Eziraya here.

00:23:11.809 --> 00:23:13.809
I'll try to learn more.

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:16.809
This edict to kill all the wise men would also include Daniel

00:23:16.809 --> 00:23:18.809
and his companions.

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:21.809
So let's look at this from Daniel's perspective.

00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:23.809
Here he is, young man in a foreign land,

00:23:23.809 --> 00:23:28.809
serving in the court of one of the most powerful and violent men alive.

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:33.809
And that man is now demanding that someone in effect read his mind.

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:39.980
Tell me my dream and tell me what it means.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.980
Okay.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.980
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.980
He knows your dream and what it means.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.130
Well, where is your God?

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:55.339
Where?

00:23:55.339 --> 00:23:57.339
I believe that he...

00:23:57.339 --> 00:24:00.339
I know that he will reveal it to me.

00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:02.339
Please, give me time.

00:24:02.339 --> 00:24:08.960
Daniel is not acting on previous experience.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.960
He hasn't received interpretations of dreams from Jehovah.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.960
Instead, he is acting on faith.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.960
Faith that he had learned by studying the sacred books of his time.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:25.960
These books, likely included the inspired writings of Moses and David Solomon,

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.960
Isaiah, Jeremiah, and other prophets.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.960
Oh, we can only imagine Daniel.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.960
Pouring over these scrolls,

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:39.960
opening up his heart to Jehovah, begging Jehovah to give him wisdom and understanding.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.960
He loved it.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.960
And there's no doubt that as Daniel studied these accounts,

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.960
his faith was strengthened,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.960
and his bond with Jehovah drew even closer.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.960
But even though Daniel knew nothing of King Nebuchadnezzar's dream,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:01.960
he was fully convinced that Jehovah would reveal the dream and its interpretation

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.960
and prove to be Daniel's salvation.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.960
Do we know exactly which accounts Daniel was able to draw from at this time?

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.960
It's impossible to say for a certainty.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.960
But we do know he had access to the books.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.960
He references the prophecies of Jeremiah.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.960
Daniel could see how Jehovah blessed faithful, obedient men in the past.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.960
So by asking Nebuchadnezzar for time,

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.960
he wasn't looking to buy himself another day of life.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:37.619
He was allowing Jehovah to reward his faith by revealing the dream to him.

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.619
Daniel strikes a balance here,

00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:45.619
although he is confident that Jehovah will reveal the dream to him.

00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:49.619
He isn't casual in the way he handled the situation.

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:53.619
He did what any God-fearing man would do here.

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:57.619
He approached Jehovah in prayer.

00:25:57.619 --> 00:26:01.619
Oh, Jehovah, surely you didn't bring us here just to die.

00:26:02.619 --> 00:26:05.619
What will people say?

00:26:05.619 --> 00:26:12.619
We told them that you are the God of the heavens, the only God who can reveal secrets.

00:26:12.619 --> 00:26:17.119
Please, vindicate yourself.

00:26:17.119 --> 00:27:00.990
The man from the axiles of Judah who can make known the interpretation to the king.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:05.009
I know who he is.

00:27:05.009 --> 00:27:09.009
Can you really make known to me the dream that I saw and its interpretation?

00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:27.500
There is a God in the heavens who is a revealer of secrets.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:36.450
And he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what is to happen in the final part of the days.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.450
This is your dream.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:47.809
You saw an immense image.

00:27:47.809 --> 00:28:02.940
That image was standing in front of you.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.940
You yourself are the head of God.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:13.220
After you, another kingdom will rise and fear you to you.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.220
Then another kingdom.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.220
A third one of copper that will rule over the whole earth.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:25.220
As for the fourth kingdom, it will be strong like iron.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:30.140
The kingdom will be divided.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:35.140
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:40.140
so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:48.440
This took a tremendous amount of faith and courage on the part of Daniel.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.440
Now we may find our peace threatened.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.440
Our very lives might be on the line.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.440
In that moment, we can turn to Jehovah God in prayer,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.440
opening up our hearts, confident that he will support us.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:10.440
Like both Daniel and Jonah, we've been given an assignment to proclaim a message.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:17.440
This requires courage to speak out boldly concerning Jehovah's judgments against those who oppose his sovereignty.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:25.440
Both of these prophets are excellent examples of Jehovah backing those who trust in him.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:30.440
Jehovah will always be with us as long as we have faith in him.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:35.440
When we face situations that seem impossible as in the case with Hezekiah,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:41.440
we have the ability to tap into the most powerful force there is.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.440
As this system comes to a close,

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:51.440
we will find ourselves in situations that test our courage and threaten our peace.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.440
We will have to stand up for pure worship, just like Josiah,

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.440
and this will be unpopular.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.440
But with Jehovah on our side, we can face those situations with confidence.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.440
He's all powerful, and he's going to help us through it.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.440
Now here's the interesting thing.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:16.440
Some of the prophecies that Daniel recorded applied not only to the future of the Babylonian Empire,

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:23.440
but also outline world events to our day and beyond.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:30.440
And these events are being fulfilled right before our very eyes.
