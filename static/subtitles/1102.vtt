00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:18.050
I was born in Caracas and live in an area of the city called Patari.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.050
In Patari, I have to live with violence and delinquency.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.050
A few years ago, we lost a pioneer sister who sadly was hit by a bullet.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.049
Well, something like that also happened to my son.

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:41.049
There was a confrontation in the neighborhood and a stray bullet hit my son and killed him instantly.

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:49.329
That left such a void.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.329
It hurt me to go into his room and see his empty bed.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.329
An empty see his things, his shoes, his favorite clothes.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.329
See them in the wardrobe.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.329
Crying was inevitable.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.250
But these situations were very difficult to deal with at the time.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:19.180
But as soon as the congregation found out about the situation, right away they gave me support.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.180
They were there to help care for all the things you need to do when you lose a loved one.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.739
After going through all that, I was very afraid to continue going out in field service.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:35.739
I feared for my life and for the life of my family.

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:43.530
I prayed to Jehovah and Jehovah gave me practical wisdom to continue.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.469
Sometimes when I'm alone meditating and thinking about my son,

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:58.469
those memories return and of course I have a setback, so to speak.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.469
And I begin to cry again.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:12.949
But keeping clearly in mind, the promise of the resurrection is what motivates me to keep going.

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:17.949
An account that I really like and that I always keep in mind is the account about Lazarus.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.949
Their Martha uses an expression.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.949
She says, I know he will rise on the last day.

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.949
And there's the same confidence that I have in Jehovah.

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.949
I know that my son will rise.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.949
Jehovah will give him to me.

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:38.780
At the time that this terrible thing happened.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.780
It's true I lost my joy for a time.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:51.360
But later, after the morning passes, the resurrection hope gives us joy.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.360
It is if Jehovah speaks to me saying, keep calm.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.360
It is if he gives me a gentle pat, telling me to keep going and that's what will happen to you.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.360
Keep faithful and continue loyal and I will give him back to you.
