00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.290
and introduction to the book of 1st Timothy.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.289
The Apostle Paul's first letter to Timothy was written from Macedonia about 61 to 64 CE.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.730
Paul indicates that Timothy was an emphasis at the time.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.730
Paul wrote 1st Timothy to set out organizational procedures in the congregation

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.730
and to warn against false teachings and the love of money.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.730
1st Timothy has six chapters.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:40.729
In chapter 1, Paul encourages Timothy to remain in Ephesus so that he may correct those who have deviated from Christ teachings.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.729
Paul also expresses gratitude for Christ's great mercy.

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:54.729
Even though Paul had persecuted the Christian congregation, Jesus considered him faithful by assigning him to a ministry.

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:06.730
In chapter 2, Paul mentions the need to pray for others, including government officials, so that God's people can lead a calm life and pursue their ministry in peace.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:15.730
He explains that it is God's will that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:25.730
In chapter 3, Paul outlines the spiritual qualifications for those reaching out to serve as overseers or ministerial servants.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.730
Did you know?

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.730
The Greek verb translated reaching out means stretching to grasp something.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:40.730
The Apostle thus shows that brothers who want to serve others in the congregation should exert themselves.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.730
Paul writes in chapter 4 that a time will come when some will fall away from the faith and try to mislead others.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.730
These apostates will speak lies and even forbid marriage.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.730
He encourages Timothy to be a fine example in speaking, in conduct and in love.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.730
Timothy should continue applying himself to public reading and to teaching.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:17.979
In chapter 5, Paul counsels Timothy to treat older men as fathers, younger men as brothers, older women as mothers and younger women as sisters.

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:29.979
He explains to Timothy that, if necessary, the congregations are to provide material aid to elderly widows who are truly in need and have a reputation for fine works.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.930
In chapter 6, the Apostle states that those who teach things contrary to Christ's teachings are puffed up with pride.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:49.930
Paul also mentions that those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many harmful desires.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.620
Their love of money will lead to their spiritual ruin and cause them many pains.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:06.620
Instead of being greedy, Christ's followers should be generous and ready to share, putting their trust in God so that they may get a firm hold on the real life.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:17.990
As you read verse Timothy, note how Jehovah wants all sorts of people to be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:26.990
How Christians can avoid the love of money and how we can get a firm hold on the real life which only God's kingdom can give us.
