00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.500
And this morning in our comments, we're going to talk a bit about the headship arrangement.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.980
That aspect of Jehovah making sure things take place decently and by arrangement.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.739
For many people in the world, the headship arrangement is a distasteful thing.

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:22.620
In fact, our comments even mention that many women today feel oppressed by it.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.100
But why do they feel this way?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.260
Is it the fault of the arrangement?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.980
The answer is no.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.340
The headship arrangement is a perfect arrangement, a loving arrangement from Jehovah.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:44.219
More often the problem lies in how the humans in the arrangement discharge their responsibilities.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.780
But for a moment, consider three reasons why we can say that the headship arrangement

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.539
is perfect, it is loving from Jehovah.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.219
The first reason is that Jehovah's wisdom is seen in the headship arrangement.

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:05.019
I invite you to turn with me to the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 11.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.579
And let's read verse 3 where the headship arrangement is laid out.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.019
And let's look for that.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:14.620
How is wisdom shown in this arrangement?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.019
1 Corinthians 113.

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:22.659
It says, but I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.260
In turn, the head of a woman is the man.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.140
In turn, the head of the Christ is God.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.340
So how is wisdom seen in this arrangement?

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.620
Well, the watchtower said that there are two key elements in the headship arrangement.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.540
And if you were to try to pick or choose what are those two key elements, what would you think?

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.299
Maybe authority and submission?

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.579
Well, that might seem logical, but that's not what the watchtower said.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.739
It said, the two key elements are authority and accountability.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:01.739
The watchtower went on to say this.

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:06.579
Jehovah has given Jesus authority over the congregation,

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.939
but Jesus is accountable to Jehovah for the way he treats us.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:17.060
Jehovah has also given a husband authority over his wife and children,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.539
but a husband is accountable both to Jehovah and Jesus for the way he treats his family.

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:31.500
So the wisdom is that there are checks and balances built into the arrangement itself.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.860
For example, the husband's authority over his family is not absolute.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.740
He cannot do whatever he wants or treat them however he wants just because he is the head.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.620
Rather, he is accountable to Jehovah and Jesus for the way that he treats his family.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.620
And for the spiritual man, that makes all the difference in the world.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.979
And that helps him to discharge his responsibilities in a proper way.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.939
So that's the first point.

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.099
There is great wisdom in the headship arrangement itself.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.740
The second point is that the headship arrangement provides clear, dignified roles

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.939
for each member of the family.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.460
Really, the headship arrangement is an expression of today's text.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.780
Let's look at that again for a Corinthians 1440.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.340
Let all things take place decently and by arrangement.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.539
This is what the headship arrangement provides for the family.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:38.860
For example, the wife in the family has a clear, dignified role in the family arrangement.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.500
She has a place that is hers and she has full scriptural freedom to operate within that role.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:52.580
And as husbands, don't we appreciate what our spiritual wives contribute to the family

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.819
operating within her God-given assignment?

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.020
How many times has the spiritual input of our wives helped us to avoid making a mistake

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:10.419
or helped us to see a matter from an angle that we would never have thought of on our own?

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.740
How many times does the spiritual input of our wives help us to make a better decision

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.540
or to see the need to do something loving for someone in need?

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.139
She's operating within her role, but what a significant impact she has on the joy,

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.660
on the success, on the reputation of our family.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.819
So that's the second point.

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:41.329
The headship arrangement provides clear, dignified roles for each member of the family.

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:47.490
The third point is that the very foundation of the arrangement is love.

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:53.930
For example, turn with me please to the book of Ephesians, chapter 5.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:03.610
In Notice, verse 25, how clearly Jehovah communicates to husbands how they are to carry out their assignment,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.490
their role in the headship arrangement.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.129
Ephesians 5, 25, it says, husbands, continue loving your wives.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:20.170
Just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.649
So the headship arrangement clearly is not just a cold, efficient, organizational chart.

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:28.569
It is to be administered in love.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.009
Love should be the centerpiece of the arrangement.

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:38.129
Love should never leave the arrangement, as the verse says, continue loving your wives.

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:45.170
Also, in verse 25, Jehovah makes it clear that husbands have the Christ to look to as an example

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.370
in the way he treated the congregation.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.649
And essentially, Jehovah says, look at the Christ, you husbands.

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:59.259
That is how you are to love your wives always.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:04.740
Well, some may feel oppressed by the headship arrangement, but as we've discussed,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.019
it's not the arrangement.

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:08.139
That's it, fault.

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.300
It is a perfect loving arrangement.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.259
It reflects Jehovah's wisdom.

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:21.339
It provides clear, dignified roles for each member, and it is to be administered in love.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:26.899
So then, to make sure no one does feel oppressed in the arrangement, where does the responsibility

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:27.899
lie?

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:32.259
We let lies with those of us in the arrangement, doesn't it?

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:42.009
And on that point, Ephesians chapter 4, in verse 16, provides us some very good direction.

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.009
Ephesians 4, 16.

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:48.129
Of course, this is specifically talking about the body of the congregation, but we can

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:52.649
extract the principle and apply it to the family unit as well.

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:59.089
So here's what it says, Ephesians 4, 16, from him, all the body is harmoniously joined

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:05.250
together and made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:12.009
When each respective member functions properly, this contributes to the growth of the body

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:16.370
as it builds itself up in love.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.050
What that verse says is certainly true about the human body, isn't it?

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:27.129
When every member of our body operates and functions properly, we get things done smoothly.

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:28.490
But have you ever had an injury?

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.769
For example, have you ever had your arm in hand in a cast?

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:37.930
Now trying to tie your shoes with one hand or button your shirt with one hand or type

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.970
on the computer becomes very awkward.

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:45.209
But when each member functions properly, now we can even think about it.

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:47.649
We can get things done as very smooth.

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:50.410
And so it is in the family arrangement as well.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:56.209
When each member does their assigned role, as the verse says, functions properly, then

00:07:56.209 --> 00:08:01.490
that contributes to the growth of the arrangement.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.889
And of course, this is where the challenge comes in, because all of us are imperfect.

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:10.569
So none of us are naturally good husbands.

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:13.050
None of us are naturally good wives.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:18.410
We have to make adjustments in our personality in our way of doing things so that we function

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.170
properly and contribute to the growth of the family.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.170
And we do.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.170
Don't we?

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.170
We work hard to do that.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:31.089
For example, if a husband finds that his natural tendency is to be a bit strong in

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:37.330
his headship, maybe even domineering, or on the other hand, maybe he's the other way.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:42.769
The husband finds that his natural tendency is to shy away from taking the lead or making

00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:43.769
decisions.

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:49.570
Well, in either case, that husband will look to God's word, examine what he can do, make

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.169
adjustments so as to function properly in the headship arrangement, and contribute to

00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:57.090
the growth of the family.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:02.250
Similarly with a wife, if she finds that her natural tendency is to be a bit strong, maybe

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.409
a little bit talks over her husband or wants to correct his decisions.

00:09:07.409 --> 00:09:12.850
Or on the other hand, maybe she finds that she could be contributing a bit more to the

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.370
family in a spiritual way, well, she'll do the same thing.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:22.490
She'll examine God's word, see what adjustment she can make, function properly, and then contribute

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.690
to the growth of the family.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:31.730
In these ways, each member of the arrangement functions properly to the success of the

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.570
headship arrangement and the family.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.490
So yes, the headship arrangement is a good arrangement.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.250
It is perfect, it is from Jehovah.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:47.529
And as each one of us works hard to fulfill our role in the arrangement, we will see the

00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:53.330
success of the arrangement grow, and we will thank Jehovah for his loving oversight of

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:53.929
our family.
