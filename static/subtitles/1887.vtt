00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.299
Hello, everyone.

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.259
For this update, I'd like to talk about what you dear brothers and sisters have accomplished

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.460
during the past few months.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.179
Jehovah must be very proud of you.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.179
Your obedience, your zeal.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.820
It's might of all the obstacles you haven't led up in your service.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.940
On the contrary, we're receiving reports from one country after another, of peaks in

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:36.179
the number of publishers, placements, regular pioneers, Bible studies, and meeting attendants.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.259
Well done, faithful servants of Jehovah.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:44.979
Of course, all of us are anxious to get back in the door-to-door work and doing public

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.780
witnessing.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.420
And if we're limited to doing letter writing and telephone witnessing, we might feel that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.020
we aren't accomplishing much.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.539
If that's the way you feel, remember what we're told at Revelation chapter 14 and verse

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:00.539
6.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.239
I'd like you to follow along as I read this.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.959
It says, and I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:17.560
And he had ever lasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.239
and tribe, and tongue, and people.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:28.120
So an angel or a group of angels are supervising the preaching work.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.599
Now just think, because of our limitations, the angels may be busier than ever, making

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.120
sure that the kingdom message reaches the right people.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.159
Otherwise, how would you explain the increases we're seeing?

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.200
You write a letter and send it out.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
The recipient reads it?

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.359
But isn't interested.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.200
What have you accomplished?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.239
You have given a witness.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:59.359
Maybe the most thorough witness that person has ever received.

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.000
Some people are never home when we call, or they never answer the door.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.759
So they have no idea what we believe, until they receive that letter.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:17.039
But suppose someone else in the household would be interested.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.639
The angels might say to it that that person reads the letter.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:29.719
You've given the angels something to work with, or you dial the wrong number that turns

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.280
out to be the right number.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.919
Were the angels involved in any of the following experiences?

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.520
Could be the judge.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.240
A sister in South America was doing telephone witnessing, but she wasn't getting much success,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.199
but she didn't give up.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.520
She called another number, and a man answered the phone.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.680
The sister explained that she was calling to encourage her neighbors who were suffering

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.960
because of the pandemic, and she read Jeremiah 29-11, which says that Jehovah is offering

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.120
us a future and a hope.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.039
Then the man said, this phone call was no coincidence.

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.439
It was from God.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.400
They explained that the sister had called a radio station and that she was on the air.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.960
A lot of people were listening to her at that very moment.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.919
They had just been talking about the pandemic.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.479
The sister quickly prayed for strength, and then shared a number of encouraging scriptures

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.280
with the radio audience.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.400
She also told them about our website.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.240
The host took note of the scriptures and enthusiastically encouraged his listeners to visit

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.280
the website.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280
What a witness!

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.479
Now ask yourself, would the sister have dialed that number if she had known she'd be talking

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:58.039
to a radio audience?

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:03.120
Another sister in the United States was ordering a dress over the phone, and she had prayed to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.479
Jehovah for the courage to give a witness when the transaction was completed.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.719
She followed through on her prayer.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.840
First, she commanded the customer service agent for her kindness, and then asked if she

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.560
could read a scripture from the Bible.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.240
The young lady agreed.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.040
Turns out that she had studied the Bible years earlier, but she'd stopped because she

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.839
had a lot going on in her life.

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:34.000
A study was started in the Teach Us book, and the young lady attended the Zoom meeting

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.040
the very next Sunday.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.079
What about this one?

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.439
A brother in Japan wrote to one hundred of his former schoolmates.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:50.160
Now in their thirties many of them were facing problems in the workplace and had concerns

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.519
about how they'd raised their children properly.

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:58.399
When a talk about family life was given on the congregation, twenty-nine of his former

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.920
classmates attended.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:10.779
Now he's studying with eighteen of them, a sister in Brazil called a woman on the phone.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.779
She's out at the phone, rang just as the woman was about to take her life.

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:21.300
She had a lot of problems, but that call convinced her that God is interested in her.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.860
She accepted a study and is making great progress.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.500
Another sister living on an island under the France branch had an appointment with a doctor.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.139
After talking about her own health problems for a while, she asked a doctor how he was doing.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.500
She was surprised.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.019
He said, his patients rarely showed personal interest in him.

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:48.540
This opened the way for the sister to give a witness.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.540
Turns out that the doctor never answered the door when the witness was called.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.259
At the end of the conversation, the doctor said that for the next appointment he'd scheduled

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:03.620
the sister at the end of the day so they could continue their discussion.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.740
An eight-year-old sister lives at a rural area in France.

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:13.180
She called a woman living in an isolated village and talked about the model prayer.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.980
That turned out to be just the right subject.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.540
The woman said that she'd been raised by nuns, but has never understood the model prayer.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:29.740
A Bible study is being conducted each week, and the woman is attending our Zoom meetings.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.100
Now what does each of these experiences have in common?

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.620
One wrote a letter, dialed the phone, or spoke up.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:44.740
The brothers and sisters did what they could and gave the angels something to work with.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.420
So put the angels to work.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.060
Take advantage of opportunities to witness to schoolmates, medical personnel,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.540
delivery men, shopkeepers.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.540
A simple way to start any conversation is to say,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:04.019
I'd like to tell you about a website where millions have found encouraging information.

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:11.500
Speaking of our website, a real effort is being made to provide up-to-date information on GW.org.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.540
Let's listen.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.620
Has Brother Herman van Sound?

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.620
I hope her to the writing committee tells us about it.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.300
Something remarkable happened in January of last year.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.139
What was it?

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.620
The writing committee, together with the coordinator's committee,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.660
decided that the home page of our website should feature articles

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.860
that are relevant to current events,

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:44.139
grab the viewer's attention, and provide the Bible's explanation and advice.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:50.139
Now, how did that decision, made in January, prove to be timely?

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:55.100
Well, just a few months later, the pandemic began.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.500
So the writing department immediately began to develop articles

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.620
that would address key questions or issues on the minds of people.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.459
However, the challenge was that normally preparing one issue of awake or watchtower

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:13.579
can take more than 18 months.

00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:20.939
So we had to find a way to prepare articles for the home page in a much shorter time.

00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:27.339
Gladly, with Jehovah's help and with the help of the brothers and sisters in various departments,

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:32.700
the total time for preparing and publishing one new article for the home page

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.899
has been reduced to five weeks.

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:41.740
We are grateful that a good number of home page articles already have been published

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.139
on topics related to the pandemic.

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:52.059
Which of these six articles do you think received the most visitors on our home page?

00:08:52.059 --> 00:09:00.019
The number one article was, what does the Bible say about pandemics?

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:02.740
Now, what does that show?

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.779
People want to know how current events are related to the Bible

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:14.860
and our website explains in clear language how world conditions are fulfilling Bible prophecy.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:22.659
That makes the information on our website different from what people may find elsewhere.

00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:28.419
Brothers and sisters around the world also find the articles helpful.

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:34.100
To give one example, a couple with teenage children wrote,

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:41.059
just when the experience feel at a loss about how to deal with the pandemic, isolation,

00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:47.940
stress and social unrest, an article appears that gives clear scriptural guidance

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.659
on how to handle what we are dealing with.

00:09:51.659 --> 00:10:01.779
We appreciate so much how quickly the faithful slave provides us with exactly what we need.

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:07.700
Now many have expressed how the home page articles help them in their ministry.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.539
Here are some of their comments.

00:10:10.539 --> 00:10:14.779
From Spain, they are eye-catching.

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:19.139
The language is simple, but powerful.

00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:20.899
Bain in.

00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:27.860
Publisters are impressed how in tune the articles are with current events.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:36.860
Netherlands, they are helping publishers to stay enthousiastic in the ministry during the pandemic.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:44.019
Scandinavia, publishers check the home page before starting phone witnessing.

00:10:44.059 --> 00:10:52.419
Britain is exactly the right thing for our current form of ministry.

00:10:52.419 --> 00:11:00.100
These recent developments with the home page are a faith strengthening example of how the faithful

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:10.039
and discreet slave is providing awesome spiritual food at the proper time.

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:18.200
In closing, we'd like to commend all of you once again for your resourcefulness and zeal during this pandemic.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:24.519
Keep up the good work, brothers and sisters, and may your whole of them bless you richly.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:30.600
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
