Everything was going fine until Mr. Craig started talking about evolution.

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:17.120
He said, the wide variations of living things on earth are the results of the evolutionary

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.600
process.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.000
All living creatures, including us, descended from a common ancestor.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.760
Most of the class agreed with him, but the other witnesses chose to stay quiet.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:41.420
I wanted to speak up like Tyler did, but I was scared too.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.100
But then I remembered my Bible study.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.820
Last week we studied about jail.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.619
She probably felt scared too when facing the terrifying Cicero, but she used a tool she

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:58.700
had to come to the assistance of Jehovah, and he blessed her for it.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.740
It made me think about what tools do I have.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.780
I think there are good reasons to believe that God designed all living things.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.819
My phone contains a lot of information.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:16.700
My contacts, notes, emails, pictures, but it didn't come that way.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.299
I put it there.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.260
That's just a phone.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.980
What about the information for this plant?

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.379
Where did it come from?

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:29.700
I'm really glad I took a stand, and it even led to a good witness.
