WEBVTT

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.289
We extend a warm welcome to all.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.289
Today's session will begin with a music video presentation

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.289
that will remind us of the many blessings in store for Jehovah's servants

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.289
and motivate us to share these precious truths with others.

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.289
Please enjoy.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:04:30.259
The ancient songs of Jesus

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.610
and all the perfect ones will be.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.610
We will always have love

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.610
and that is life.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:05:13.899
I feel more pain,

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:19.040
I feel more pain in my heart

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.370
I will not remember.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:07:31.100
It's over.

00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:46.029
The scripture theme for these two sessions is taken from 2 Peter 314,

00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:50.029
where we are admonished to be found spotless

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:54.029
and unblemished and in peace.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:11:01.340
These sessions will highlight what we can individually do to pursue peace with others.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.340
To begin, please join in seeing song number 58,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.340
searching for friends of peace.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.340
That song number 58.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:14:10.679
As Jehovah's people,

00:14:10.679 --> 00:14:13.679
we are proud to witness about the God of peace

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:16.679
and to proclaim his kingdom.

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:19.679
How can we give an effective witness

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:23.679
and help interested ones to progress?

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:28.679
Our first symposium for this session will address these questions.

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:30.679
For the Catholic Dean,

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:32.679
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:36.679
will deliver the first talk of the symposium.

00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:39.679
Be ready to share the good news of peace,

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.679
maintain your zeal.

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:55.059
This symposium is about sharing the good news of peace.

00:14:55.059 --> 00:15:00.059
What a privilege it is to help humble people find peace with Jehovah.

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:03.059
At Ephesians 6.15,

00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:06.059
and describing our Christians' complete suit of armor,

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:08.059
it mentions our feet.

00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:10.059
Now, back at that time,

00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:12.059
thank you Roman soldiers,

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:14.059
Paul knew that often they marched for hundreds of miles

00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:16.059
on Roman highways,

00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:18.059
crisscrossing the empire.

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:20.059
So at Ephesians 6.15,

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:22.059
he said this,

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:26.059
having your feet shed in readiness,

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:30.059
in readiness to declare the good news of peace.

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:35.059
Yes, ready to share the good news of peace

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:37.059
on every suitable occasion.

00:15:37.059 --> 00:15:40.789
In this symposium,

00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:44.789
we'll discuss five ways to remain ready to preach and teach.

00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:48.789
We'd first like to discuss why it's important

00:15:48.789 --> 00:15:50.789
to maintain your zeal.

00:15:50.789 --> 00:15:52.789
Now, as an analogy,

00:15:52.789 --> 00:15:56.789
zeal has often been linked to fire.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.789
We even use expression, don't we?

00:15:58.789 --> 00:16:01.789
He has a fiery zeal for his beliefs.

00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:05.789
Well, what does a fiery zeal indicate?

00:16:05.789 --> 00:16:08.789
Please find Romans 114 and 15,

00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:11.789
and here it does not actually use the word zeal,

00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:14.789
but the sense of the word is evident.

00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:16.789
You see, we're on fire.

00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:17.789
We're stoked up.

00:16:17.789 --> 00:16:18.789
We are ready.

00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:19.789
Did you find it?

00:16:19.789 --> 00:16:21.789
Romans 114 and 15.

00:16:21.789 --> 00:16:25.809
Both to Greeks and to foreigners,

00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:27.809
both to wise and to senseless ones,

00:16:27.809 --> 00:16:29.809
I am a debtor.

00:16:29.809 --> 00:16:31.809
So I am eager.

00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:33.809
You see, ready with fiery zeal,

00:16:33.809 --> 00:16:37.809
eager to declare the good news.

00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:41.809
Celicy evangelizers are eager to declare the good news.

00:16:42.809 --> 00:16:43.809
They're on fire.

00:16:43.809 --> 00:16:49.860
They want others to find peace with Jehovah.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.860
But is there something that can dampen that flame?

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.860
Something that could even extinguish the eager desire,

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.860
the readiness to find those

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.860
who even unknowingly yearn for peace?

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.859
Yes.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:07.859
It can be difficult to remain eager with fiery zeal

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.859
when we face such problems as

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.859
an unresponsive territory,

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:17.859
criticism, or outright opposition to the work,

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:22.859
and then there are the pressures of daily life.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.859
Those issues can also be likened to a fire,

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:27.859
to destructive fires,

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.859
like the wildfires that have plagued

00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:33.859
the western part of the United States year after year.

00:17:33.859 --> 00:17:40.579
Those problems can threaten our zeal and enthusiasm.

00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:42.579
So what can we do?

00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:44.579
Well, there's an English expression

00:17:44.579 --> 00:17:46.579
that originates with firefighters.

00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:51.579
The expression is to fight fire with fire.

00:17:51.579 --> 00:17:53.579
In the path of a raging wildfire,

00:17:53.579 --> 00:17:57.579
one technique is to ignite a controlled fire.

00:17:57.579 --> 00:18:01.579
That controlled fire consumes combustible materials.

00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:04.579
So when the wildfire advances to that point,

00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:06.579
there's no fuel left,

00:18:06.579 --> 00:18:08.579
and the wildfire goes out.

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:11.579
Fight fire with fire.

00:18:11.579 --> 00:18:15.579
Keep your zeal for the ministry burning brightly.

00:18:15.579 --> 00:18:18.579
And now please find 1st November the 416.

00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:23.410
If our zeal fades,

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.410
the flame smolders,

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.410
we might miss out on opportunities

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.410
to help others to gain life,

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.410
a life of peace with God.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.940
Look at 1st November the 416 with me.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.940
It says, pay constant attention to yourself

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.940
and to your teaching.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.940
To the flame, the temperature,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.940
pay attention to your zeal in teaching.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.940
It says, persevere in these things.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.940
For by doing this, you'll say both yourself

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.940
and those who listen to you.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.940
Yes, share the good news of peace with zeal.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.940
Now in the following video,

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.940
note how a couple realized

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.940
that the flame had gone out.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.940
They still had some glowing embers left,

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.940
they now find a way to fan the coals

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:39.460
and regain their fire zeal.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.460
I don't remember when our routine service day became so...

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:55.869
well, routine.

00:19:55.869 --> 00:19:58.869
Our zeal wasn't what it used to be.

00:19:58.869 --> 00:20:15.700
We're finally starting to notice.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.700
Not everyone wants to listen.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:29.700
We just didn't want to be the reason.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.700
We didn't take much research to find great ideas

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:38.170
and set a few simple goals

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.170
like working with those who encourage us.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.990
With Dyota and Ami,

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.990
we're always talking about

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.990
how we can reach the heart.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.990
We got back to basics.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.990
Be friendly.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.339
Listen.

00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:01.339
Let the conversation progress naturally.

00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:04.339
Try to share an appealing scriptural thought

00:21:04.339 --> 00:21:09.700
and keep trying.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:16.039
Our zeal can attract an honest person to the truth.

00:21:16.039 --> 00:21:22.970
In the video,

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.970
what wildfires or problems

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.970
did the couple face that sucked the oxygen out of their ministry?

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.970
Well, the four we mentioned earlier,

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.970
it seems the couple's zeal was waning

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.970
because of seemingly unresponsive territory.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.970
And as tired as the husband looked in that first scene,

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.970
the pressures of daily life

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.970
might have been having a toll on him.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.970
So how did they come to realize

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.970
they needed to fight fire with fire?

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:59.410
Do you remember their kitchen table talk?

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.410
The husband mused that not everyone wants to listen.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.410
But then he added,

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.410
we just didn't want to be the reason.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.410
You see, the reason for them not listening.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.410
They decided to fight fire with fire.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.410
They re-ignited their own controlled fire of zeal

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:21.410
to counteract the problems they were succumbing to.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.410
Well, what were some of the techniques they used?

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.410
The first was to pray to Jehovah.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:33.410
Could it be the husband borrowed the words of Romans 12-11 in this prayer?

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.410
Yes.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.410
He may well have asked Jehovah to help him as a couple

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.410
to be a glow with the Spirit.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.410
Remember he said earlier,

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:48.410
I don't remember when our routine service day became so,

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.410
well, routine.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:56.690
Fight the wildfire by again becoming a glow with the Spirit.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.690
Ensure that any lack of response

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:04.349
is not due to our lackluster.

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:08.349
Well, what else did you notice they did to rekindle their zeal?

00:23:08.349 --> 00:23:10.349
They did some research,

00:23:10.349 --> 00:23:14.349
looking for suggestions to invigorate their ministry.

00:23:14.349 --> 00:23:17.349
Yes, and regular Bible study helps us to remember

00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:21.349
why we endure and the disciples making work.

00:23:21.349 --> 00:23:25.349
For example, review Jesus' attitude toward the ministry.

00:23:25.349 --> 00:23:29.349
The apostles bold witnessing despite fiery opposition.

00:23:29.349 --> 00:23:31.349
The disposition of Paul,

00:23:31.349 --> 00:23:35.349
Aquila and Priscilla, Stephen, and other Bible characters.

00:23:35.349 --> 00:23:42.660
These can infuse us with similar zeal.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.660
Next, keep your ministry fresh.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.660
Well, what does that mean?

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.660
Instead of having a number of phone calls that go unanswered,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.660
which is similar to having no one at home when in the door-to-door work,

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.660
change the time of day for witnessing when more people are home.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:07.059
Participate in various forms with ministry.

00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:09.059
You know, ironically,

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:12.059
the pandemic, more or less for some of us

00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:15.059
who were staunch, door-to-door witnesses,

00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:16.059
could branch out.

00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:19.059
We tried phone witnessing, letter writing,

00:24:19.059 --> 00:24:22.059
and now we have a variety of preaching activities,

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:26.059
and this can keep us more fully engaged and enthused.

00:24:26.059 --> 00:24:32.539
And did you notice what the couple in the video said as a goal?

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:35.539
Periodically, they decided in advance

00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:38.539
to share in the ministry with someone specific.

00:24:38.539 --> 00:24:41.539
And then they determined to talk about encouraging subjects

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:43.539
when in-between calls,

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:47.539
whether in phone witnessing or in the public ministry.

00:24:47.539 --> 00:24:53.099
Jehovah values our work in the ministry,

00:24:53.099 --> 00:24:56.099
regardless of the response we receive.

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:58.099
Hey, Route 610.

00:24:58.099 --> 00:25:01.099
Are you familiar with that? Of course you are.

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:03.099
But it does not say,

00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:07.099
Jehovah does not forget the number of return visits you make.

00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:08.099
It does not say,

00:25:08.099 --> 00:25:12.099
he does not forget how many Bible studies you conduct.

00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:16.099
No, it says he does not forget your work,

00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:17.099
your effort,

00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:20.099
and the love you showed for his name.

00:25:20.099 --> 00:25:24.740
Our Zeal for the ministry demonstrates that

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.740
we have a deep love for Jehovah and Jesus.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.740
If like the couple in the video,

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.740
you detect that your routine of service

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.740
is becoming well, very routine,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.740
then fight fire with fire.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.740
Maintain that fire as Zeal.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.740
Be ready to share the good news of peace.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.430
Brother Robert Soranco,

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.430
a helper of the writing committee,

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:55.430
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:58.430
Be ready to share the good news of peace.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.430
Prepare well.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:10.950
What would you think and how would you feel if I showed up

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.950
to give this talk but had done nothing to prepare what to say to you?

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.950
I had not bothered to study the outline I was given,

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.950
could not remember the theme,

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.950
had no idea what the main points are,

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.950
and would have to guess at what scriptures to use to support them.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.950
And then as I spoke, I would ramble in coherently

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.950
and make a very bad impression.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.950
I know how I would feel,

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.950
I would be a nervous wreck,

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.950
and you would wonder why I did not think enough of you

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.950
to put all the time and effort that was necessary

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:43.950
into preparing the talk so that you could get the most benefit from it.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.950
Can you see where I'm going with this?

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.950
Could the same things be said if you engaged in the ministry

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.950
without first preparing what to say?

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.950
You did not review the sample conversations that had been provided,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.950
could not think of how to start a conversation

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.950
and did not know what scripture to share.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.950
How nervous would you be?

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.950
And what would the householder think of you?

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.950
It would likely be a very short, uncomfortable conversation

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:15.950
and the other person may not care to have you call again.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.950
We should take some time to prepare well before we preach.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.950
Why?

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.950
Because we have the best message ever,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.950
the good news of peace to share with people,

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:32.950
and we should do our best so that they will want to listen to what we have to say.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.950
Jesus helped his disciples to prepare for the ministry.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:41.950
Luke chapter 10 reports that before sending out 70 disciples to preach,

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.950
he shared with them a pleasant way to greet each householder,

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.950
told them what to talk about, the kingdom of God,

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.950
and he told them how to respond to the varied reactions

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.950
they would get in their territory.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:58.950
As a result, because the disciples were fully prepared for the ministry,

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.950
they enjoyed some thrilling experiences.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:06.950
When we are prepared, we are more poised, enthusiastic,

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:10.950
and can truly enjoy the ministry.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:16.950
As you watch the following video, notice the good results of preparing well.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:30.359
We'd made some good changes,

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:35.740
but we weren't done.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.740
I asked Yudi what she planned to talk about.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.740
That started the usual scramble,

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.740
and we got it, the sample conversation.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:57.960
That'll do, but for that to work, I had to remember the scripture.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:20.490
We were both a little forgetful that morning.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:30.019
Yeah, we needed to prepare better.

00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:34.019
We've been relying on our experience and not enough on Jehovah.

00:29:34.019 --> 00:29:40.619
So, first, we prepared our hearts.

00:29:40.619 --> 00:29:53.210
Then, we prepared our minds and found new ways to use our preaching tools.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:30:03.779
Even a little preparation for initial calls.

00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:08.779
And our return visits went a long way.

00:30:08.779 --> 00:30:26.990
The husband said, yeah, we needed to prepare better.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:30.990
Have you ever thought that about your ministry?

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:36.990
Like the couple in the video, we can first prepare our heart and our mind,

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.990
and then see how best to use our preaching tools.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.990
Our goal should be the same as that of the Apostle Paul.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.990
At 1 Corinthians 9, verse 23,

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:54.990
he wrote that he wanted to do all things for the sake of the good news

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:56.990
and spread with others.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:02.990
So, let's think about some specific things we can do to prepare well,

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.990
beginning with what we can say on the initial call,

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.990
whether that is done in person or over the telephone.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:14.990
Each issue of the Christian life and ministry meeting workbook

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.990
provides us with sample conversations.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.990
They give us some helpful ideas.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.990
Of course, you may modify the samples or use something entirely different.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:26.990
Perhaps a subject from a previous month or a different scripture

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.990
would have wider appeal in your territory.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.990
Your opening words may be the most important part of the presentation,

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.990
so think it through.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:40.990
If the introduction does not arouse interest,

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:44.990
the other person may terminate the conversation before we can give a witness.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:48.990
We will be more effective if we carefully prepare

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:54.990
the first sentence or two that we will say after giving a customary greeting.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.990
We might say,

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.990
many people are concerned about

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.990
or

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:02.990
I would like to get your opinion on

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.990
or say something else.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.990
Then pick a topic that is of local interest

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.990
and ask a wellward viewpoint question that will draw the person

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.990
into the conversation.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.990
Now, what about preparing for return visits?

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.990
That actually begins on the initial call

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.990
by leaving a question for the person to think about until you call again.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.990
That is how the sample initial calls and return visits are set up

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.990
in the median workbook.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:36.990
By leaving a thought-provoking question at the end of every visit,

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:42.990
we can keep the chain of conversations going as long as possible.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:46.990
We can illustrate it this way.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.990
Imagine a freight train with an engine at the front,

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.990
a caboose of the rear,

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.990
and many cars in between.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:58.990
What keeps all those cars moving together down the train track?

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:02.990
There is a device called a coupler at the back of each train car

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.990
that latches onto the coupler at the front of the car behind it.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.990
By being coupled or linked together,

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.990
the cars all run as a unit along the track.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.990
So, the question that we leave with a householder

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.990
at the end of one visit is what we can latch onto

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.990
at the beginning of our next visit

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.990
so that we can keep the train of thought going

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.990
from one conversation to the next.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:32.990
For example, on the initial call you could ask,

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:36.990
why is there so much suffering in the world?

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.990
After discussing that, raise the question,

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.990
how does God feel about our suffering?

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:48.990
But don't answer the question until your next visit.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.990
After answering that question on the first return visit,

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:54.990
leave the person with this question,

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.990
what will God do to end our suffering,

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.990
to be discussed on your next visit?

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:04.990
It is also important to have an objective in mind

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.990
to return visit.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.989
Before making the call, think about what you want to accomplish on that call.

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:12.989
If you raised a question,

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:16.989
the last time your objective will surely include answering that question

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:18.989
from the Bible.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:22.989
Of course, the ultimate objective is to try to start a Bible study

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:28.239
in the enjoy life forever brochure.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:32.239
Now, what about preparing for the Bible studies that we conduct?

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:34.239
Even if we know the material very well,

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:40.239
we should prepare for each study session with our student in mind.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:46.239
That means thinking about and anticipating the views and needs of that individual.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:50.239
What points might he struggle to understand or accept?

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:54.239
It also means getting familiar with the lesson to be covered

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:58.239
in our interactive Bible course.

00:34:58.239 --> 00:35:00.239
Read the lesson carefully.

00:35:00.239 --> 00:35:02.239
Look up the read scriptures to see how they apply.

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:06.239
Watch the videos that will be shown during the lesson

00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:10.239
and review the items in the explore section

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:14.239
so that you will know which of those will be especially helpful to your student.

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:20.239
Then, you will be well prepared to conduct the study.

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:24.239
Since it is God who makes the seed of truth grow in a person's heart,

00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:28.239
we should ask for Jehovah's blessing on our preparation for the study

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:32.239
so that we can best help the student spiritually.

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:37.619
And we will be more effective in our ministry if we stay up to date

00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:43.619
with the latest material and features found on JW.org and in JW Library.

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:47.619
So learn how to navigate the website and the app.

00:35:47.619 --> 00:35:53.619
Two very helpful features on the website are Bible questions answered

00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:55.619
under the Bible Teachings tab.

00:35:55.619 --> 00:35:59.619
And frequently ask questions under the about us tab.

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:05.619
They can also be found on the app under article series.

00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:13.619
The Apostle Paul described himself at 1 Corinthians 310 as a skilled master builder.

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:17.619
That is because he was engaging in a spiritual construction work

00:36:17.619 --> 00:36:19.619
to build Christian disciples.

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:23.619
And we are doing the same sort of work when we engage in the ministry.

00:36:23.619 --> 00:36:29.619
But to build effectively, we must learn to use our tools well.

00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:33.619
We especially need to develop skill in using our principal tool, God's Word,

00:36:33.619 --> 00:36:37.619
as well as learn how to make effective use of the publications

00:36:37.619 --> 00:36:41.619
in our teaching toolbox.

00:36:41.619 --> 00:36:47.619
A builder who prepares before starting to work avoids mistakes and frustration.

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:51.619
Remember what the brother said at the end of the video?

00:36:51.619 --> 00:36:55.619
Even a little preparation goes a long way.

00:36:55.619 --> 00:36:59.619
And that is what will help you to do your best in the ministry.

00:36:59.619 --> 00:37:03.619
Just as Paul recommended at 2 Timothy 2 verse 15.

00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:07.619
Please follow along in your Bible, if you will.

00:37:07.619 --> 00:37:13.219
It's 2 Timothy 2 verse 15.

00:37:13.219 --> 00:37:17.219
Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God,

00:37:17.219 --> 00:37:22.219
a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the Word of the truth,

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:25.219
a right.

00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:30.219
Then you will experience great joy in the spiritual building work that is taking place now

00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:37.219
because you will be ready and well prepared to share the good news of peace.

00:37:37.219 --> 00:37:40.219
Brother Anthony Morris, a member of the governing body,

00:37:40.219 --> 00:37:43.219
will now present the next talk of the symposium.

00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:46.219
Be ready to share the good news of peace.

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:48.219
Take the initiative.

00:37:48.219 --> 00:38:00.579
For this part of the symposium, share the good news of peace.

00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:05.579
We're going to discuss the need to take the initiative.

00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:10.579
Now, we're going to look at why we should take the initiative,

00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:15.579
how to take the initiative, and then concluding thought about

00:38:15.579 --> 00:38:20.579
who's helping and directing us in our preaching work.

00:38:20.579 --> 00:38:24.579
Now, first of all, why take the initiative?

00:38:24.579 --> 00:38:27.579
Well, think about it.

00:38:27.579 --> 00:38:33.579
One thing about being Jehovah's Witnesses is that we're never off duty.

00:38:33.579 --> 00:38:40.579
We never stop being one of Jehovah's Witnesses, wherever we are, whatever we're doing.

00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:46.579
So it isn't just that when we're out in formal preaching work with congregation group,

00:38:46.579 --> 00:38:51.579
we are one of Jehovah's Witnesses all the time.

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:58.579
There's no such thing as being off duty when we're one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:38:58.579 --> 00:39:06.579
Now, to give you an idea of how significant this is with informal witnessing,

00:39:06.579 --> 00:39:11.579
let me tell you a statistic, a survey was taken some years ago,

00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:14.579
and you'll be surprised possibly.

00:39:14.579 --> 00:39:19.579
In one group of over 200 baptized Witnesses,

00:39:19.579 --> 00:39:26.579
now notice over 40% have been contacted by informal witnessing.

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:28.579
Isn't that amazing?

00:39:28.579 --> 00:39:34.579
So the door to door is crucial, of course, during COVID that's been inhibited,

00:39:34.579 --> 00:39:39.579
the letter writing has its place, the phone witnessing,

00:39:39.579 --> 00:39:45.579
but the point is there's other times where we can do some witnessing informally.

00:39:45.579 --> 00:39:53.579
Now, let's examine how to do it, and the best example of how to do informal witnessing

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:55.579
is, of course, Christ Jesus.

00:39:55.579 --> 00:40:00.579
And there's an account all of us are familiar with in the Bible book of John,

00:40:00.579 --> 00:40:09.579
so please find John chapter 4, and we're going to take a look at how Jesus took the initiative

00:40:09.579 --> 00:40:15.579
and then imitate him to do just as he did.

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:24.579
Now, notice here in John chapter 4, we get the context that they've been traveling through Samaria,

00:40:24.579 --> 00:40:30.579
and then verse 6 will read, in fact, Jacob's well was there.

00:40:30.579 --> 00:40:36.579
Now, Jesus tired out as he was from the journey was sitting at the well.

00:40:36.579 --> 00:40:39.579
It was about the sixth hour.

00:40:39.579 --> 00:40:43.579
Now, that's interesting as it not, see?

00:40:43.579 --> 00:40:50.579
Jesus was tired, perfect man, but human, and his journey tired him out,

00:40:50.579 --> 00:40:57.579
and he's there about noon sitting at the well, and on notice what happens.

00:40:57.579 --> 00:41:03.579
In verse 7, a woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:41:03.579 --> 00:41:13.050
Jesus said to her, give me a drink, real simple, give me a drink.

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.050
Well, what did we learn from this?

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:18.050
As you notice, Jesus was tired.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:23.050
We get tired because of being imperfect.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:26.050
If a perfect man gets tired out, certainly we get tired.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:32.050
Sometimes you get feeling, well, maybe I could witness to this person take the initiative,

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.050
but I just don't feel like it. I'm tired.

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:38.050
Not with Jesus.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:44.050
See, to imitate Jesus even in a case that you're tired, you're thinking of others,

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:49.050
and you want to take the opportunity to start a conversation.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.050
That's the initial goal.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:58.050
Now, notice something else here that we learn in the ninth verse of John chapter 4.

00:42:00.489 --> 00:42:08.489
Samaritan woman said to him, how is it that you, despite being a Jew, ask me for a drink,

00:42:08.489 --> 00:42:11.489
even though I am a Samaritan woman?

00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:18.489
And then we learn more here with parentheses for Jews, have no dealings with Samaritan.

00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:21.489
And it went both ways.

00:42:21.489 --> 00:42:26.489
That's the way the prejudice was, no dealings, and on top of that, she's a woman.

00:42:27.489 --> 00:42:33.489
And women were not treated very nice during that period in man's history.

00:42:33.489 --> 00:42:41.489
So she's a Samaritan, she's a woman, and Jesus asks her for a drink.

00:42:41.489 --> 00:42:43.489
Starts a conversation with her.

00:42:43.489 --> 00:42:46.489
Now, these are the things we learn with this.

00:42:46.489 --> 00:42:54.489
He didn't make any assumptions about her, and obviously knew she was a woman,

00:42:54.489 --> 00:42:59.489
and a Samaritan, a traveling through Samaritan at that time.

00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:04.489
And he didn't refuse to speak to her because of that.

00:43:04.489 --> 00:43:11.489
So the lesson for us there is don't judge people by what you see,

00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:15.489
based on their culture, color of their skin.

00:43:15.489 --> 00:43:18.489
This world is filled with judges.

00:43:18.489 --> 00:43:20.489
Where do you hold his witnesses?

00:43:20.489 --> 00:43:22.489
We don't do that.

00:43:22.489 --> 00:43:29.489
We leave the judging to Jehovah in Jesus Christ, and don't judge whether you think they'll converse with you.

00:43:29.489 --> 00:43:31.489
That's wrong.

00:43:31.489 --> 00:43:37.489
Jesus didn't do that, and he set that perfect example for us.

00:43:37.489 --> 00:43:44.489
Go ahead, and then if you're a little nervous about it, then we beg Jehovah for his spirit to help us,

00:43:44.489 --> 00:43:51.489
to give us the courage to witness about his beautiful name and purposes.

00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:56.489
Now, he also teaches us something else, interesting here,

00:43:56.489 --> 00:44:04.489
and this is where taking the initiative, you start a conversation, you don't rush into things.

00:44:04.489 --> 00:44:11.489
Now, notice how you see we read verse 9, and then they had this conversation take place

00:44:11.489 --> 00:44:15.489
through these following verses here.

00:44:15.489 --> 00:44:22.489
They get to verse 24 where he mentions God's spirit and must worship him with spirit and truth.

00:44:22.489 --> 00:44:29.489
And now, here's what happens, they had this fine conversation after simply asking for a drink.

00:44:29.489 --> 00:44:33.489
Notice verse 25, the woman said to him,

00:44:33.489 --> 00:44:38.489
I know that Messiah is coming who is called Christ.

00:44:38.489 --> 00:44:43.489
Whenever that one comes, he will declare all things to us openly.

00:44:43.489 --> 00:44:46.489
She spoke out of her heart.

00:44:46.489 --> 00:44:50.489
Notice verse 26, Jesus said to her,

00:44:50.489 --> 00:44:57.489
I am He, the one speaking to you, my, what a moment.

00:44:57.489 --> 00:45:02.489
And she's blessed with having the Messiah Himself speak to her.

00:45:02.489 --> 00:45:06.489
However, give it some thought.

00:45:06.489 --> 00:45:11.489
What if Jesus, rather than say, give me a drink, start it off with,

00:45:11.489 --> 00:45:14.489
I am the Messiah.

00:45:14.489 --> 00:45:18.489
Give me a drink.

00:45:18.489 --> 00:45:23.489
Don't know, because Jesus had Jehovah's spirit and heavenly wisdom,

00:45:23.489 --> 00:45:25.489
and He entered the conversation first.

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:29.489
So that's what we want to keep in mind, try to do ourselves.

00:45:29.489 --> 00:45:31.489
They have a conversation.

00:45:31.489 --> 00:45:38.489
It might just be speaking from your heart and trying to engage the person.

00:45:38.489 --> 00:45:43.489
For example, you could be in the doctor's office waiting room.

00:45:43.489 --> 00:45:49.489
So you speak from your heart and you notice the person is looking at you and I said,

00:45:49.489 --> 00:45:54.489
I look forward to the day I'll never be sick again.

00:45:54.489 --> 00:45:58.489
Well, they could look at you and say,

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:04.489
this guy is crazy, or they could say, well, that would be nice.

00:46:04.489 --> 00:46:07.489
Or what makes you believe that's going to happen for you.

00:46:07.489 --> 00:46:13.489
Either way, you're starting taking the initiative to start a conversation

00:46:13.489 --> 00:46:15.489
and leave the rest to Jehovah.

00:46:15.489 --> 00:46:20.489
He's the one that gets the credit for the results.

00:46:20.489 --> 00:46:23.489
Now, next we have a video here.

00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:27.489
Now as you watch the following video, notice how a sister finds

00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:32.489
an effective way to witness informally.

00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:57.440
They seem nice.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:01.440
I knew what Yudhi was thinking.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.440
I wanted to start a conversation,

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.440
but I didn't want to bother them either.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:26.139
And when an opportunity came, I just froze.

00:47:26.139 --> 00:47:36.110
Then I was in a rush to give a witness.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:52.230
It felt forced.

00:47:52.230 --> 00:48:02.110
It helped to hear that with all been there,

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:05.110
our past experiences were similar.

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:15.059
Whenever we didn't put pressure on ourselves

00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:19.059
and just looked for something in common to talk about,

00:48:19.059 --> 00:48:24.059
we could usually find a moment when we could say something about the Bible.

00:48:24.059 --> 00:48:27.059
She was curious why we were dressed up.

00:48:27.059 --> 00:48:41.880
Turns out that she'd never talked to Jehovah's Witnesses before.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.880
So how we appreciated how she took the initiative.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.880
Of course, you see the contrast there that at one point she froze.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:55.880
So it is stressful, no doubt about it, or only human.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:59.880
But then she rushed into things, running after it with the track.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.880
See, give us some thought, try to have the conversation,

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.880
then let the spirit move it, and that would be imitating Jesus.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.880
Then it can move into getting into the spiritual purpose

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.880
of initiating the conversation.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.880
So good example.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.880
Give it a try, brothers and sisters,

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.880
and let Jehovah bless your efforts.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.880
Now, to conclude, I think to want to share this beautiful thought

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.880
when it comes to this work we're engaging in

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.880
and sharing the good news of peace by taking the initiative,

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.880
never forget this.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:42.880
And you know it, but it's a good reminder, Revelation chapter 14.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:50.880
And here in the Revelation, familiar to most of you listening

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.880
in verse 6, let's read it.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.880
And I saw another angel flying in mid-Heaven,

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.880
and he had ever lasting good news to declare to those who dwell

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:07.880
on the earth to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.880
Now, this is profound.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.880
Obviously, angel flying in mid-Heaven,

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.880
the footnote helps us where it's overhead,

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.880
where the birds fly.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:23.880
You don't see them, and see another angel in mid-Heaven.

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.880
That's how close they are.

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.880
And this is something you want to meditate on.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.880
Personally, when I was in the traveling work,

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.880
sometimes I'd be working with one of the brothers,

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.880
or one of the sisters, and they had opposition

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.880
and some of the territories we'd work,

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.880
and I could tell they were feeling the stress,

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.880
and I know it was the reaction of some of these householders.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.880
So what I used to enjoy doing,

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.880
and they appreciated after they realized what I was doing.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.880
We'd be walking along, and then I'd just stop,

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.880
and I'd look up, and I'd say,

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.880
you see them?

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.880
And they're like, who?

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.880
You're right up there above the trees,

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.880
and they'd look at me like,

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.880
our circuit overseers lost it.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.880
But I said, see,

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.880
and we'll tell them about Revelation 146.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.880
When we're in the preaching work,

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.880
whether it's informal,

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.880
or out there, formally door to door,

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.880
the angels are the real reapers.

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.880
At least one is nearby.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.880
What a profound thought.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.880
They are the real harvesters.

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.880
They are the ones directing us to the rightly disposed people.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.880
Don't ever forget that.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.880
When it comes to being ready to share the good news of peace,

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.880
you go ahead and take the initiative,

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.880
to start conversations.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.880
You'll have valuable opportunities

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.880
to share the good news of peace.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.699
Now, Brother Gary Brewer,

00:52:04.699 --> 00:52:06.699
a helper to the service committee,

00:52:06.699 --> 00:52:10.699
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:52:10.699 --> 00:52:13.699
Be ready to share the good news of peace.

00:52:13.699 --> 00:52:16.699
Follow-up on interest.

00:52:16.699 --> 00:52:28.190
To encourage us to promptly follow-up on interest

00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:30.190
that we find in the Phil ministry,

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:36.190
Paul Likens our work to a plant that grows from a little seed.

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:41.190
Now, what vital for a planted seed to grow?

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:43.190
One authority says,

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:47.190
of all the factors that determine seed germination,

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:51.190
water is the first and most important.

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:53.190
And another reference says,

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.190
until seeds have sprouted,

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.190
keep the seed bed moist,

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.190
never allowing it to dry out.

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:06.190
So, what will happen to a seed that is not watered?

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:08.190
Nothing.

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:10.190
It will lay dormant.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:14.190
The regular watering is vital for a seed to sprout,

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.190
to take root,

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:19.190
and in fact continue to grow.

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:21.190
Now, with these facts in mind,

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:25.190
Paul's words at 1 Corinthians 3 and verse 6

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.190
shows that more is required

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:31.190
than simply planting a seed of truth.

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:33.190
Let's note his words.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:38.190
It's in 1 Corinthians 3 and verse 6.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:41.079
It says,

00:53:41.079 --> 00:53:44.079
I planted Apollo's watered,

00:53:44.079 --> 00:53:47.079
but God kept making it grow.

00:53:47.079 --> 00:53:50.079
Though all credit goes to Jehovah God

00:53:50.079 --> 00:53:52.079
for making the spiritual seed grow,

00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:56.079
but he allows us to have a role in the process.

00:53:56.079 --> 00:54:01.079
Did you notice the important role Apollo's played?

00:54:01.079 --> 00:54:03.079
He did the watering.

00:54:03.079 --> 00:54:05.079
In a regular way,

00:54:05.079 --> 00:54:08.079
he helped keep the spiritual soil

00:54:08.079 --> 00:54:10.079
of the individual moist,

00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:13.079
never allowing it to dry out.

00:54:13.079 --> 00:54:15.079
Many people who show interest

00:54:15.079 --> 00:54:17.079
in the Kingdom message today

00:54:17.079 --> 00:54:21.079
are searching for their truth about God.

00:54:21.079 --> 00:54:24.079
In order to teach them progressively,

00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:28.079
we must return again and again.

00:54:28.079 --> 00:54:31.079
This requires good preparation

00:54:31.079 --> 00:54:35.079
and organization on our part.

00:54:35.079 --> 00:54:38.079
By promptly making return visits,

00:54:38.079 --> 00:54:42.079
we demonstrate a sincere concern for the individual,

00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:45.079
wanting to help them grow spiritually

00:54:45.079 --> 00:54:49.079
and develop a relationship with Jehovah.

00:54:49.079 --> 00:54:51.079
In the following video,

00:54:51.079 --> 00:55:02.829
notice how a sister follows up on interest shown.

00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:11.119
Ami left a great question for her next visit.

00:55:11.119 --> 00:55:15.119
Return visit, Mrs. Iwata.

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:18.119
I told her I'd visit this morning.

00:55:18.119 --> 00:55:23.199
I just didn't schedule the time.

00:55:23.199 --> 00:55:34.360
I could at least stop by on the way back.

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.360
Mr. again,

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:45.269
if I didn't try something different,

00:55:45.269 --> 00:55:48.269
I was just going to keep missing her.

00:55:48.269 --> 00:55:53.260
First, I wanted her to know

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.260
I hadn't forgotten her.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:56:12.809
Dear Mrs. Iwata,

00:56:12.809 --> 00:56:15.809
I hope you're doing well.

00:56:15.809 --> 00:56:17.809
I promised to come by early next week.

00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:19.809
By the way,

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:27.539
your flowers are so beautiful.

00:56:27.539 --> 00:56:30.539
Then I made a plan for my service day.

00:56:46.539 --> 00:56:51.539
Following through is just too important to leave to chance.

00:56:51.539 --> 00:57:01.030
As you plan your share in the ministry,

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:04.030
follow the good example of the sister in the video

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:08.030
and schedule time to make regular return visits.

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:14.030
Doing so is just as important as other aspects of our ministry.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:17.030
These regular visits with interested people

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:22.030
are vital links in the chain leading to a Bible study.

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:26.210
In our ministry,

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:28.210
we often compliment the householder

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:31.210
for the beautiful flowers or our plants in their yard,

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:35.210
just like the sister did in the video.

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:38.210
But how do they get that way?

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:42.210
Well, the householder probably watered them on set days

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:46.210
or even used an automatic sprinkler timer

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:49.210
to schedule regular watering cycles.

00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:53.210
You need to have healthy and vibrant plants.

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:57.210
Watering cannot be left to chance.

00:57:57.210 --> 00:58:00.210
Well, how can we apply that to our ministry?

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:05.210
Before leaving a person that has shown interest,

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:10.210
endeavor to set the proper time to water.

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:13.210
The water of truth will come on.

00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:16.210
See, perhaps a wed day or hour

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:19.210
would you like for me to return to continue our discussion

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:21.210
or to answer the question.

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:26.210
This consideration really dignifies the person,

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:30.210
allowing them to share in setting the appointment.

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:33.210
It's important that we be willing to water

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:39.210
an interested person at the most convenient time for them.

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:42.210
Then, just like setting a timer,

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:45.210
put that appointment where you'll remember it.

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:49.210
The sister in the video put it in her electronic calendar

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:53.969
so she could be reminded later.

00:58:53.969 --> 00:58:56.969
If you promise someone that you'll return

00:58:56.969 --> 00:58:58.969
then keep your promise.

00:58:58.969 --> 00:59:00.969
Remember Jesus' simple statement

00:59:00.969 --> 00:59:03.969
recorded at Matthew 537,

00:59:03.969 --> 00:59:07.969
just like your word, yes, mean, yes?

00:59:07.969 --> 00:59:10.969
If they're truly interested,

00:59:10.969 --> 00:59:14.969
they may go to great efforts to keep the appointment.

00:59:14.969 --> 00:59:18.969
How disappointed they would be if we didn't show up.

00:59:18.969 --> 00:59:23.969
Following through is just too important

00:59:23.969 --> 00:59:26.969
to leave to chance.

00:59:26.969 --> 00:59:30.969
Because of the busy lives that people have today,

00:59:30.969 --> 00:59:34.969
it may be hard to find the person at home again,

00:59:34.969 --> 00:59:37.969
even if you set an appointment.

00:59:37.969 --> 00:59:42.969
It's a good idea to try and obtain his contact information,

00:59:42.969 --> 00:59:45.969
maybe his phone number.

00:59:45.969 --> 00:59:48.969
Some publishers anticipate this challenge

00:59:48.969 --> 00:59:50.969
and simply ask,

00:59:50.969 --> 00:59:52.969
do you text?

00:59:52.969 --> 00:59:54.969
By simply texting,

00:59:54.969 --> 00:59:56.969
you may be able to keep in touch

00:59:56.969 --> 01:00:02.139
and cultivate the interest further.

01:00:02.139 --> 01:00:05.139
If you can't get his contact information

01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:09.139
and the person isn't home at the agreed upon time,

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:11.139
you might leave a brief note

01:00:11.139 --> 01:00:14.139
just as the sister did in the video.

01:00:14.139 --> 01:00:16.139
This will assure the householder

01:00:16.139 --> 01:00:20.139
that you haven't forgotten them.

01:00:20.139 --> 01:00:27.139
The disciple making work requires patience and persistence.

01:00:27.139 --> 01:00:36.179
In this regard, note what Ecclesiastes 116 says.

01:00:36.179 --> 01:00:38.179
Ecclesiastes 116, it says,

01:00:38.179 --> 01:00:41.179
sow your seed in the morning

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:44.179
and do not let your hand rest until the evening.

01:00:44.179 --> 01:00:47.179
For you do not know which will have success

01:00:47.179 --> 01:00:50.179
whether this one or that one

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:52.179
or whether they will both do well.

01:00:52.179 --> 01:00:56.690
When it comes to planting literal seed,

01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:00.690
we don't know when and where it will sprout.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:06.690
Many factors are beyond our control.

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:10.690
Something similar can be said of the disciple making work.

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:13.690
We need to be patient and positive

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:18.690
because we don't know who will respond.

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:21.690
Lastly and of utmost importance,

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:24.690
even if they return visit his brief,

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:28.690
share a scriptural thought.

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:31.690
The spiritual content of our conversation

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:33.690
is what makes our visit different

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:36.690
from many others that they may have.

01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:38.690
Do they have neighbors, friends,

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:42.690
workmates or relatives that check in on them?

01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:46.690
But for them to grow spiritually,

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:51.690
the water of truth from God's word must be dispensed.

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:55.690
To convey just a brief scriptural thought

01:01:55.690 --> 01:02:03.579
may provide just enough to keep their spiritual soil moist.

01:02:03.579 --> 01:02:06.579
The work involved in following up interest

01:02:06.579 --> 01:02:09.579
is a very important assignment

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:12.579
that Jehovah has given to each of us.

01:02:12.579 --> 01:02:17.579
With this in mind, let's return to Paul's illustration

01:02:17.579 --> 01:02:20.579
and see how Jehovah views us.

01:02:20.579 --> 01:02:26.579
It's back at 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 9.

01:02:26.579 --> 01:02:31.199
It says,

01:02:31.199 --> 01:02:34.199
For we are God's fellow workers,

01:02:34.199 --> 01:02:39.199
you are God's field under cultivation, God's building.

01:02:39.199 --> 01:02:44.199
It's an honor to be one of God's fellow workers,

01:02:44.199 --> 01:02:49.199
enabling us to show our love for Him and for our neighbors.

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:53.199
It brings us great joy to share the good news of peace

01:02:53.199 --> 01:02:57.199
by following up on interest shown.

01:02:57.199 --> 01:02:59.199
And we can be assured

01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:01.199
those who respond favorably

01:03:01.199 --> 01:03:05.199
will forever appreciate our diligent efforts

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:09.199
when they recall how we promptly followed up

01:03:09.199 --> 01:03:11.199
when they showed interest.

01:03:11.199 --> 01:03:15.889
Brother William Malenfont,

01:03:15.889 --> 01:03:18.889
a helper to the teaching committee,

01:03:18.889 --> 01:03:20.889
will now present the final talk of this symposium,

01:03:20.889 --> 01:03:24.889
be ready to share the good news of peace,

01:03:24.889 --> 01:03:27.889
help students grow to maturity.

01:03:27.889 --> 01:03:39.440
Basic Bible teachings are wonderful.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.440
Usually, it's the fundamental doctrines of the Bible,

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.440
basic teachings that draw people to the truth.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.440
However, learning basic Bible teachings

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:55.440
is just the beginning of knowledge about Jehovah.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.440
At Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 1,

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.440
the Apostle Paul exhorts all students of God's Word

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.440
to progress beyond basic teachings.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.440
This is what is stated at Hebrews 6-1.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.440
Therefore, now that we have moved beyond

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.440
the primary doctrine about the Christ,

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.440
let us press on to maturity.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.440
Isn't that what we want to achieve with our Bible students?

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.440
To help them move beyond the primary doctrine

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.440
and progress to Christian maturity?

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.440
It comes about in degrees,

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.440
as students acquire an increased level of knowledge

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:43.440
and appreciation for the truth.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.440
Bible students must learn to love God

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.440
and His standards

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.440
and appreciate that all of His ways and requirements

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.440
are expressions of His love for us.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.440
When Bible students experience the good

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.440
that comes from obeying Jehovah

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.440
and following His ways,

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.440
their love for Him will deepen.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.440
As you watch the following video,

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.440
please note how a sister helps her student

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.440
to make progress toward maturity.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:24.550
Mrs. C. Water was doing great.

01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:27.550
We were already on lesson 10.

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:30.550
I really hope she comes to a meeting soon.

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:36.500
We talked about Hebrews 10, 24 and 25

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.489
and watched the video.

01:05:40.489 --> 01:05:50.340
Did I miss something?

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:56.269
I guess I did.

01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:59.269
I was too focused on our progress with the lessons.

01:05:59.269 --> 01:06:03.269
Instead of her progress and what she needed,

01:06:03.269 --> 01:06:12.960
Mr. C. Water said going to meetings

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.960
would dishonor the family.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.960
He wanted her to quit the study.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.960
She didn't want to quit,

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.960
but whenever she tried to talk about it,

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.960
they argued.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.960
We showed her where to look for help

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:55.150
and made time during our studies to talk about it more.

01:06:55.150 --> 01:07:03.539
We all prayed for Jehovah to bless her efforts.

01:07:03.539 --> 01:07:15.610
We did our best to share the good news of peace,

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:22.820
and Jehovah did the rest.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:26.820
As we saw, the student took an important step

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:28.820
toward Christian maturity

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:31.820
when she began to attend meetings.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:36.820
As you study with your student lesson 7 to 11

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:39.820
of the Enjoy Life Forever book,

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:44.820
please be sure to highlight Jehovah's appealing qualities

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:47.820
that are set forth in those lessons.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.820
For example,

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:52.820
Lesson 7 of the Enjoy Life Forever book describes

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:56.820
Jehovah's loving ways.

01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.820
We want to help our students to understand

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:03.820
that Jehovah really does love them as individuals

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:08.820
and wants them to achieve everlasting life.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.820
The Apostle John highlights Jehovah's love

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.820
at 1 John 4.9 by pointing out

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.819
that Jehovah sent Jesus to earth

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:19.819
to take our place in death

01:08:19.819 --> 01:08:22.819
and thus pay for our inherited sins

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:25.819
and our personal sins.

01:08:25.819 --> 01:08:27.819
Yes, out of love,

01:08:27.819 --> 01:08:30.819
Jehovah provided a way for us to enjoy

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:33.819
an approved standing with Him.

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:37.819
This is one of Jehovah's loving ways.

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:43.819
Lesson 8 shows us how to become Jehovah's friend.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.819
This is likely something that most people

01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:48.819
have never even thought of.

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:53.819
Can you imagine the privilege of becoming God's friend?

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:57.819
Help your students to see how their obedience

01:08:57.819 --> 01:09:00.819
and exclusive devotion to Jehovah

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:04.819
pave the way to friendship with Him.

01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:08.819
Proverbs chapter 3 verses 5 and 6

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:13.819
tells us specifically what Jehovah wants us to do.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:18.819
Proverbs chapter 3 verses 5 and 6 says,

01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:25.420
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:29.420
and do not rely on your own understanding.

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.420
In all your ways, take notice of Him

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:37.420
and He will make your path straight.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.420
We show our trust in Jehovah

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.420
by doing what He tells us to do

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:47.420
and thereby we become His friends.

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.420
Jehovah takes good care of His friends

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:54.420
and He is always loyal to them.

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:59.420
Lesson 9 highlights the power of prayer.

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:05.420
Teach your Bible students how to pray to Jehovah.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.420
In addition to prayer,

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.420
regular Bible reading is also necessary

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.420
to make spiritual progress.

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.420
Psalm, the first Psalm,

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.420
verses 2 and 3,

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:21.420
encourages Bible reading.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.420
Let's look it up together.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.420
That Psalm, the first Psalm,

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:31.420
and we're going to read verses 2 and 3.

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:34.420
It's speaking about a man of God

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.420
who takes delight in God's Word.

01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:37.420
It says,

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:41.420
But His delight is in the law of Jehovah,

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.420
where the law of Jehovah is found in the Bible.

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.420
And it says,

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:48.420
and He reads His law in an undertone,

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.420
day and night.

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.420
He will be like a tree planted by streams of water,

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:57.420
a tree that produces fruit in its season,

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.420
the foliage of which does not wither,

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.420
and everything He does will succeed.

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.420
Yes, everything He does as a Christian,

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:10.420
leading a Christian life will succeed.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.420
Reading God's Word

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.420
and then putting it into practice

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:16.420
brings Jehovah's blessing.

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:19.420
Now, if you have a student

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.420
who feels limited in His learning ability,

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.420
perhaps due to a lack of education,

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:30.420
please encourage him to go to Jehovah in prayer

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:36.420
and persist in asking him for help to understand his Word.

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.420
James chapter 1 and verse 5 assures us

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:43.420
that Jehovah is ready and willing

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:48.699
to help those who keep on asking him for help.

01:11:48.699 --> 01:11:51.699
Lesson 10 gives this direction.

01:11:51.699 --> 01:11:53.699
As soon as possible,

01:11:53.699 --> 01:11:57.699
invite Bible students to attend congregation meetings.

01:11:57.699 --> 01:12:00.699
What your student hears and observes

01:12:00.699 --> 01:12:03.699
at Christian meetings can touch his heart

01:12:03.699 --> 01:12:06.699
and will help him to progress.

01:12:06.699 --> 01:12:09.699
So when you show your student the video

01:12:09.699 --> 01:12:12.699
what happens at a kingdom hall,

01:12:12.699 --> 01:12:14.699
that would be a good time

01:12:14.699 --> 01:12:18.699
to warmly invite him to attend meetings.

01:12:18.699 --> 01:12:22.699
Also, be sure to invite a variety of publishers

01:12:22.699 --> 01:12:25.699
to accompany you on the study.

01:12:25.699 --> 01:12:27.699
In that way your student will get acquainted

01:12:27.699 --> 01:12:29.699
with others in the congregation

01:12:29.699 --> 01:12:31.699
and he will likely feel more at home

01:12:31.699 --> 01:12:34.699
when he attends our meetings.

01:12:34.699 --> 01:12:36.699
Lesson 11.

01:12:36.699 --> 01:12:38.699
In this lesson,

01:12:38.699 --> 01:12:41.699
we are encouraged to teach our students

01:12:41.699 --> 01:12:43.699
how to do personal study

01:12:43.699 --> 01:12:48.699
using JW.org and JW Library.

01:12:48.699 --> 01:12:52.699
Show your student how to use these tools.

01:12:52.699 --> 01:12:55.699
If you feel a bit unsure about teaching someone

01:12:55.699 --> 01:12:59.699
to make use of their electronic device for research,

01:12:59.699 --> 01:13:04.699
don't hesitate to ask for help from the congregation.

01:13:04.699 --> 01:13:09.699
There are many who will be delighted to assist you.

01:13:10.699 --> 01:13:12.699
The blessings that we receive

01:13:12.699 --> 01:13:15.699
when we teach someone the truth

01:13:15.699 --> 01:13:17.699
is described by the Apostle John,

01:13:17.699 --> 01:13:19.699
a third John, verse 4,

01:13:19.699 --> 01:13:20.699
where it states,

01:13:20.699 --> 01:13:24.699
no greater joy do I have than this,

01:13:24.699 --> 01:13:27.699
that I should hear that my children

01:13:27.699 --> 01:13:30.699
go on walking in the truth.

01:13:30.699 --> 01:13:35.699
Yes, John is speaking of his spiritual children.

01:13:35.699 --> 01:13:39.699
That same joy can be ours.

01:13:39.699 --> 01:13:43.699
What has this symposium brought to our attention?

01:13:43.699 --> 01:13:45.699
It has helped us to see

01:13:45.699 --> 01:13:49.699
how we can maintain our zeal for the preaching work.

01:13:49.699 --> 01:13:52.699
It has instructed us to prepare well

01:13:52.699 --> 01:13:55.699
to share the truth with others.

01:13:55.699 --> 01:13:58.699
It showed us how to take the initiative

01:13:58.699 --> 01:14:00.699
to give an informal witness,

01:14:00.699 --> 01:14:02.699
to follow up on interest

01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:08.699
and to help Bible students grow to maturity.

01:14:08.699 --> 01:14:11.699
If we do the best we can in the ministry,

01:14:11.699 --> 01:14:14.699
whether people respond or not,

01:14:14.699 --> 01:14:17.699
we will enjoy the peace that comes from knowing

01:14:17.699 --> 01:14:21.699
that we are pleasing Jehovah.

01:14:21.699 --> 01:14:26.699
Hebrews 13, 15 and 16,

01:14:26.699 --> 01:14:29.699
tells us how to bring pleasure to Jehovah God

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:32.699
and that's certainly something we want to do.

01:14:32.699 --> 01:14:36.699
That's Hebrews 13, 15 and 16.

01:14:36.699 --> 01:14:41.300
It reads,

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.300
through Him that is through Jesus,

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:48.300
let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise,

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.300
that is the fruit of our lips

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:55.300
that make public declaration to His name.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.300
Moreover, do not forget to do good

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.300
and to share what you have with others.

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:07.300
For God is well pleased with such sacrifices.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.300
Your readiness to share the good news of peace

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:14.300
with others is just such a sacrifice.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:19.300
And you can rest assured that Jehovah is thoroughly pleased

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:25.640
with your loving and faithful service to Him.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.640
Thank you, brothers, for helping us to be ready

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.640
to share the good news of peace effectively

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:35.560
at every opportunity.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.560
Jehovah's organization continues to grow

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.560
and there is plenty of work to do.

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.560
Young people in particular have many opportunities

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.560
to expand their service.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.560
How can a career in full-time service

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:53.560
lead to rich blessings now and in the future?

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.560
What are some common obstacles to pursuing full-time service?

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:01.560
How can they be overcome?

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.560
We encourage young ones to give special attention

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.560
to the next talk.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.560
For the Mark Sanderson,

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.560
a member of the governing body will develop the theme,

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.560
young people, choose a path that leads to peace.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:28.500
An 18-year-old brother was trying to decide

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.500
what he wanted to do after high school.

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.500
He was raised in the truth.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:37.500
And in his heart, he wanted to be a pioneer.

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:41.500
But he also had a scholarship to go to university

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500
and some other grants.

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500
And he had been accepted to attend.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500
He had many questions.

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.500
How was he going to support himself

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.500
and much pressure from his teachers and counselors

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.500
to go to university?

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.500
What decision would he make?

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500
Well, maybe many of you young ones

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500
who are listening to this talk right now

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.500
are facing that same decision.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:10.500
Or maybe you will be in a year or two.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.500
What path will you take?

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.500
Well, now here's what we know.

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:20.500
Jehovah wants you to have not just a good life,

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.500
not just an average life.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:26.500
He wants you to have an awesome, wonderful life,

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.500
both now during your youth,

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:33.500
but really for your entire life.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.500
That's why the Bible says in Ecclesiastes,

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.500
chapter 11 and verse 9,

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:44.500
rejoice young man while you were young.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.500
And let your heart be glad

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500
in the days of your youth.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.500
Well, many young people have found real joy

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.500
and peace by choosing a career

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.500
in the full-time service.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.500
But now, when we say full-time service,

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.500
what are we talking about?

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.500
Well, full-time service is not just one thing.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.500
It actually includes many things.

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.500
It includes pioneering maybe in your home congregation

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.500
or maybe in another area,

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.500
maybe in another city, state, province,

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.500
even in another country.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500
It might mean assisting with

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.500
theocratic construction projects,

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.500
maybe building kingdom halls or assembly halls

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.500
or building remote translation offices

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:34.500
or even working at Bethel facilities.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.500
And it also could mean submitting an application

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:40.500
for Bethel service and becoming a Bethelite.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:45.500
Really, there are so many wonderful opportunities

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.500
that are available for you young ones

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.500
in full-time service.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.500
But now, here's a question.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:56.500
What challenges could prevent you

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.500
from starting or continuing

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.500
on the path of full-time service?

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.500
And more importantly,

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.500
how can you overcome those challenges?

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.500
Well, let's talk about three obstacles.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.500
Here's the first one.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.500
It's financial concerns.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.500
How am I going to support myself?

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.500
Well, let's look at something that Jesus said.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.500
In Matthew, chapter 6,

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:29.800
and verse 33,

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.800
Matthew 6, verse 33, Jesus said,

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.800
keep on then seeking first the kingdom

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.800
and his righteousness,

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.800
and all these other things

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.800
will be added to you.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.800
Well, now, okay.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.800
It says all these other things,

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.800
what other things?

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.800
What is Jesus talking about here?

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:52.800
Well, to find out,

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.800
when do we go back up to verse 25?

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.800
And let's read a little bit more

01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.800
of what Jesus was talking about

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.800
when he said those famous words.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.800
Verse 25,

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.800
on this account,

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.800
I say to you,

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.800
stop being anxious about your lives

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.800
as to what you will eat

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.800
or what you will drink

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.800
or about your bodies

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800
as to what you will wear.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.800
Does not life mean more than food

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.800
and the body than clothing?

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.800
Now, after identifying,

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.800
now we know what Jesus is talking about.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.800
He's talking about our necessities,

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.800
food, shelter, clothing.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.800
But now, look at the illustrations

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.800
Jesus goes on to give now,

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.800
beginning here in verse 26.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.800
Observe intently

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.800
the birds of heaven.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.800
They do not so seed

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.800
or reap

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.800
or gather into storehouses

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.800
yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.800
Are you not worth more than they are?

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.800
Who of you by being anxious

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.800
can add one qubit to his life's man?

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.800
Also, why are you anxious about clothing?

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.800
Take a lesson from the lilies of the field,

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.800
how they grow,

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.800
they do not toil,

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.800
nor do they spin.

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.800
But I tell you that not even Solomon

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.800
in all his glory

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.800
was arrayed as one of these.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.800
Now, if this is how God clothes

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.800
the vegetation of the field

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.800
that's here today

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.800
and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.800
will he not much rather clothes

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.800
you, you with little faith?

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.800
So, never be anxious

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.800
and say, what are we to eat

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.800
or what are we to drink

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.800
or what are we to wear?

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.800
For all these are the things

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.800
the nations are eagerly pursuing.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.800
Your heavenly Father knows

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.800
that you need all these things.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.800
Well, do you get the sense of this?

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.800
Jesus was trying to reason

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.800
that just as Jehovah provides

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.800
for all of his creation,

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.800
he can provide for you too.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.800
We just need to develop our faith

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.800
that Jehovah will provide

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.800
the things we need

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.800
if we put his service first.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.800
Well, does that mean

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.800
that Jehovah is just going to drop

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.800
into our lap

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.800
everything that we need?

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.800
Well, no.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.800
Jehovah expects that we're going to use

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.800
the things that he's given us

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.800
to be able to support ourselves.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.800
So, it's very wise,

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.800
when you're young,

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:23.800
to plan ahead

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:25.800
so that you can obtain the skills

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.800
you need to be able to support yourself.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.800
Now, in some lands,

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.800
it may be that as you're growing up,

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.800
you can learn a trade

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:35.800
from your Father

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.800
or from your mother

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.800
or maybe even from another relative.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.800
In other lands, you might be able

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.800
while you're still in high school

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.800
to take some vocational courses

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.800
that would help you to learn a skill

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.800
or learn a trade.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.800
But here's the point.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.800
We need to plan.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.800
So, ask yourself,

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.800
what abilities and skills do I have

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.800
that I could use to support myself?

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.800
A sister named Kelly

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.800
had a very clear goal in mind

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.800
of becoming a pioneer.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.800
So, what did she do?

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.800
Well, this is what she says.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800
I had to choose something

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.800
that would allow me to support myself

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.800
in my ministry.

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.800
Kelly enrolled in a vocational program

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800
in her high school.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.800
And that helped her to achieve

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:22.800
her primary goal.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.800
Here's what she said.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.800
The full-time ministry

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.800
was what I wanted to do.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.800
Everything else was secondary.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.800
Well, how does Kelly feel now

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.800
about the decision that she made?

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.800
She says, I feel my decision

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:42.800
was the best one that I could have made.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.800
You, young brothers and sisters,

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.800
you can overcome that challenge

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.800
just by planning ahead

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.800
and making sure that you have practical skills

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.800
you can use to support yourself.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.800
Here's the second obstacle.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.800
Pressure from others.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.800
My relatives want me to focus on making money.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.800
Well, if that's the case,

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.800
explain your spiritual goals

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.800
in a calm, respectful way.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.800
Colossians chapter four in verse six says,

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.800
let your words always be gracious,

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.800
seasoned with salt.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:21.800
Well, we all know

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.800
when we eat food with no salt

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.800
doesn't taste very good, does it?

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.800
You put a little salt on it,

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.800
now it becomes delicious.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.800
So, make sure that when you speak

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:33.800
to your relatives,

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.800
you put a little salt on those words

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.800
so that you can reason with them

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.800
and help them to see the wisdom

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.800
of the decision that you want to make.

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.800
Well, it could be your relatives

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.800
will not agree with you.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.800
But let's look at something that Jesus said here at Luke,

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.800
chapter seven,

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.800
and verse 35,

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.590
Jesus said all the same.

01:24:59.590 --> 01:25:01.590
Wisdom is proved righteous,

01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:03.590
or now if you look at the footnote,

01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:06.590
it says, or is vindicated

01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:09.590
by all its children.

01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:11.590
Well, now what's the point?

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:14.590
Well, sometimes when people make a decision,

01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:17.590
we're not sure if it was the right one or not.

01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:20.590
But when the decision works out well,

01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:22.590
when it leads to success,

01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:25.590
when people see how happy you are

01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:27.590
and how successful you are,

01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:29.590
the joy, the satisfaction you have,

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:31.590
well, then what happens?

01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:33.590
Well, maybe your relatives will see

01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:36.590
that your decision has been vindicated.

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:38.590
It's been proved righteous

01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:41.590
by the way things have turned out.

01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:44.590
Here's obstacle number three.

01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:46.590
Unexpected challenges.

01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:50.590
I thought it was going to be easier than this.

01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:54.590
Well, those unexpected challenges can be many.

01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:58.590
It could be just trying to get used to new roommates,

01:25:58.590 --> 01:26:01.590
dealing with personality challenges,

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:04.590
or even just coping with homesickness.

01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:05.590
Here's the point.

01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:08.590
Don't give up.

01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:12.590
Notice what James said here in James chapter one,

01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:16.840
James chapter one,

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.840
and verse four.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.840
Now, you notice, as you look at verse two,

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.840
James is talking about trials,

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.840
and he's talking about how trials

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.840
can have a positive effect on us,

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.840
but now look what he says in verse four.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:35.840
But let endurance complete its work

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.840
so that you may be complete and sound

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.840
in all respects, not lacking in anything.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.840
What's James trying to say?

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.840
What's his point?

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.840
Well, have you ever heard the expression,

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.840
no pain, no gain?

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.840
Well, if you want to reach a certain fitness goal,

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:58.840
or if you want to be very good at playing a certain sport,

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:02.840
no doubt you're going to have some aching muscles,

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:06.840
and no doubt you're going to have some hurt pride along the way too.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.840
Maybe you won't be very good when you first start,

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.840
but what do you do?

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.840
If you want to become good,

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:16.840
if you want to reach your goal, you can't give up.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.840
You have to keep trying.

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.840
Well, the same could be said

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.840
about reaching our spiritual goals.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.840
You see, James mentions that trials often reveal our weaknesses.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.840
Maybe it's some aspect of our personality that needs improvement,

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.840
or maybe it's something in our relationship with Jehovah.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.840
Maybe we need greater faith.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.840
Maybe we need greater trust.

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.840
If we endure even during periods of trial

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.840
and we refuse to give up, we become stronger.

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.840
We become stronger in our spirituality

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.840
and our relationship with Jehovah,

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.840
our love for him, our faith in him,

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.840
our trust in him just continues to grow.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.840
As James says, there in verse four,

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.840
we become complete or sound in all respects,

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.840
not lacking in anything.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.840
So, when those trials come,

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.840
and they will come,

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.840
don't look for a quick way out.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.840
And doer, keep going, don't give up.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.840
Seek advice from brothers and sisters

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.840
who have successfully coped with similar challenges.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.840
And you too will be successful.

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.840
In the following video,

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.840
notice how some full-time servants have found real peace

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.840
despite those three obstacles,

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.840
financial concerns,

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.840
pressure from others,

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.840
and unexpected challenges.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:52.760
I pray to Jehovah,

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.760
if it is your will,

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.760
I would be happy to enter Pioneer Service.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:01.520
But I had to work really hard to provide for the needs of my family

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:09.300
because my father had died when he was 45 years old.

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:12.300
The elder I talked to gave me advice not to be picky

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.300
on what kind of job I would have.

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:17.300
He reminded me of Matthew 633

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:21.300
and told me not to be overly anxious.

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:24.300
Because of our good communication within the family,

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.300
we were able to find solutions.

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:30.300
My other siblings realized that they also shared responsibility

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:33.300
in providing for the needs of the family.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.300
After one year of pioneering,

01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:38.300
I was encouraged to apply for Bethel Service.

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:41.300
And now I am in Bethel.

01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:44.300
I feel that Jehovah really cares for me,

01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.300
loves me,

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:52.659
and appreciates all my efforts.

01:29:52.659 --> 01:29:53.659
Because they love me,

01:29:53.659 --> 01:29:56.659
my cousins pressured me to choose a secular career.

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.840
If I went against their wishes,

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:02.840
it would hurt them,

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.840
and put a strain on our relationship.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.840
I was really anxious.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.840
I wanted to show my trust in Jehovah by pioneering

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.840
and give him an opportunity to show me

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:19.050
that I can be happy in his service.

01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:22.050
I tried to express my appreciation for my cousins

01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:24.050
by what I said and did,

01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:28.640
and showed them love.

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.210
They realized that I have changed for the better.

01:30:34.210 --> 01:30:37.210
I show more concern for others now.

01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:41.210
Now they understand that we have been learning good things,

01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:45.210
and that we have a happier and more meaningful life.

01:30:45.210 --> 01:30:50.829
I wanted to try serving where the need was great.

01:30:50.829 --> 01:30:54.829
When I first arrived, I thought it was so cool being there.

01:30:54.829 --> 01:30:56.829
I had expected the poverty,

01:30:56.829 --> 01:31:00.829
but when I saw it hit home more than what I had expected.

01:31:00.829 --> 01:31:03.829
So then I started to feel really homesick.

01:31:03.829 --> 01:31:06.829
But my brothers and sisters, I'd go to the Kingdom Hall,

01:31:06.829 --> 01:31:08.829
and they were able to cope with the challenges

01:31:08.829 --> 01:31:11.829
that they were facing because they had Jehovah in their life.

01:31:11.829 --> 01:31:14.829
So that, their example really helped me to see

01:31:14.829 --> 01:31:17.829
that my circumstances don't need to change

01:31:17.829 --> 01:31:20.829
from my attitude to change.

01:31:20.829 --> 01:31:23.829
Proverbs 15, 15, stood out to me

01:31:23.829 --> 01:31:25.829
with having a cheerful heart

01:31:25.829 --> 01:31:28.829
and being able to have a continual feast

01:31:28.829 --> 01:31:30.829
no matter what my circumstances are.

01:31:30.829 --> 01:31:33.829
And I found an article about that scripture.

01:31:33.829 --> 01:31:37.829
And so from there I decided to ask myself,

01:31:37.829 --> 01:31:39.829
how can I use my situation

01:31:39.829 --> 01:31:41.829
and what I'm learning to help others

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:44.829
and got to start helping with foreign language group there?

01:31:44.829 --> 01:31:50.829
That whole experience just made my love for people grow so much

01:31:50.829 --> 01:31:53.829
and definitely changed my life.

01:31:53.829 --> 01:31:59.939
Some of your non-witness family members

01:31:59.939 --> 01:32:03.939
might offer you secular or financial advice.

01:32:03.939 --> 01:32:05.939
We know they mean well

01:32:05.939 --> 01:32:08.939
and they feel that they're giving you the best advice

01:32:08.939 --> 01:32:10.939
because they love you.

01:32:10.939 --> 01:32:12.939
But young brothers and sisters,

01:32:12.939 --> 01:32:17.939
we are convinced that the blessings of full-time service

01:32:17.939 --> 01:32:23.939
far outweigh any challenges that might go along with it.

01:32:23.939 --> 01:32:27.939
Just think of the experiences that we heard in the video.

01:32:27.939 --> 01:32:31.939
Harley's choices allowed him to go to Bethel

01:32:31.939 --> 01:32:35.939
and helped him to feel that Jehovah really loved him.

01:32:35.939 --> 01:32:38.939
Angel's choices took courage

01:32:38.939 --> 01:32:42.939
but those choices helped him to be more concerned about other people

01:32:42.939 --> 01:32:44.939
and helped his relatives to see

01:32:44.939 --> 01:32:47.939
that he had made a good decision.

01:32:47.939 --> 01:32:51.939
And Carly did not give up when the trials came.

01:32:51.939 --> 01:32:55.939
Instead, she learned to love other people even more

01:32:55.939 --> 01:33:01.939
and became a more powerful strong Christian.

01:33:01.939 --> 01:33:05.939
Brothers and sisters, why are we so convinced

01:33:05.939 --> 01:33:11.939
that full-time service will lead you young ones to a wonderful life?

01:33:11.939 --> 01:33:13.939
Well, it's because that's the decision

01:33:13.939 --> 01:33:16.939
that so many of us made when we were young.

01:33:16.939 --> 01:33:19.939
Do you remember that 18-year-old young brother

01:33:19.939 --> 01:33:22.939
who was trying to decide which path to take?

01:33:22.939 --> 01:33:26.939
Well, that was me some years ago.

01:33:26.939 --> 01:33:30.939
I'm so glad that with the help of Jehovah

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:35.939
and my parents and other mature friends in the congregation,

01:33:35.939 --> 01:33:39.939
I made the decision just like so many other brothers

01:33:39.939 --> 01:33:43.939
and sisters around the world to turn down that scholarship

01:33:43.939 --> 01:33:50.939
to give up university and go directly into the full-time service.

01:33:51.939 --> 01:33:54.939
That is a decision that I have never regretted.

01:33:54.939 --> 01:33:59.939
That is a decision that I will never regret.

01:33:59.939 --> 01:34:03.939
Young people, Jehovah loves you.

01:34:03.939 --> 01:34:07.939
He wants you to have a wonderful, awesome life.

01:34:07.939 --> 01:34:11.939
Choose the path of full-time service if you can.

01:34:11.939 --> 01:34:13.939
You will never regret it.

01:34:13.939 --> 01:34:17.939
It will put you on a path that leads to joy

01:34:17.939 --> 01:34:22.939
and peace with our marvelous, wonderful God, Jehovah.

01:34:22.939 --> 01:34:26.789
Thank you, brother Sanderson,

01:34:26.789 --> 01:34:30.789
for the warm encouragement to pursue full-time service

01:34:30.789 --> 01:34:33.789
from an early age.

01:34:33.789 --> 01:34:38.789
Now we invite all to join in singing song number 135,

01:34:38.789 --> 01:34:40.789
Jehovah's Warm Appeal.

01:34:40.789 --> 01:34:42.789
Be wise, my son.

01:34:42.789 --> 01:34:45.789
That song number 135.
