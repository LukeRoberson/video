00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.509
Are you missing out on a treasure?

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:11.310
Huh?

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.310
Treasure?

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.310
What treasure?

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.309
No, not that kind.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:18.309
Huh?

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.309
This kind.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:22.309
Older people are a treasure.

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:25.309
But is this how you see them?

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:34.039
Granted, some older people may not be able to do some of the things you like doing.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.039
Or know how to use all the latest gadgets.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:46.159
If that does not make them less interesting, or less smart.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.560
Now you might think, I don't have much in common with older people.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.359
Could this be what your feelings are doing?

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.560
To find the treasure in older people, you have to get to know them.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.060
So what should you do?

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.060
Well done.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.859
One of the first things you'll discover is that older people may still do some interesting things.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:27.079
And because our brain can improve in certain ways with age, older ones still have a lot to offer.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.079
For example, they're good at solving everyday problems.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.680
They can be great listeners.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.500
They may face some of the challenges you're facing right now.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.400
This experience helps them make good decisions.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.400
That's wisdom.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.709
Wisdom can protect you.

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.209
Wisdom is precious.

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.709
It's even more valuable than gold.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:06.010
So you could not have better mentors than friends who are older and wiser than you.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.729
The one walking with the wise will become wise says the Bible at Proverbs 13-20.

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:22.370
Of course, if you have important questions or concerns, you should go to your parents.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.370
When you broaden out in your choice of friends, you'll learn many interesting things.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:39.250
You'll also become a better communicator, which includes sharing your feelings with others.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.250
That's a valuable skill that's easy to lose.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.750
By associating with older people, you'll also learn about the challenges they face.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.250
This will move you to be more compassionate and understanding.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.810
Then, you may become a treasure to them.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.810
And remember, older ones cared for us when we were young.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.810
So, they deserve our love and respect.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.810
Why not include them in your circle of friends?

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.150
You'll learn a lot.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.150
You'll become wise for your age, and you'll be a better person.
