00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:17.129
Jehovah's people have always been open to applying new technologies to various aspects of our worship.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:26.129
Today, Jehovah has blessed us with a great variety of Bible research tools that help us in the ministry and in our personal study.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:36.130
Until recently, most of our publications were available mainly in printed form and will continue to use printed material in our ministry.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:46.130
But now, most of what we publish is also in digital format, accessible at our fingertips on mobile phones, tablets and computers.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.130
Much of this technology is dynamic, constantly changing and improving.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.130
So we're continually alert to adapt to new developments and update our tools as needed.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:11.129
At the 2018 Annual Meeting, the governing body announced the future consolidation of our three major websites into one, with the Combined Content also available in our JW Library app.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:16.129
This is a huge effort that will take several years to complete.

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:23.129
Still, we're happy to report on our progress so far and share some of our plans for the future.

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:29.129
We've redesigned the JW.org homepage to make it more inviting to the public.

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:38.129
JW Broadcasting, with its many hundreds of videos, is now part of the library section of JW.org.

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:44.129
The JW Library app now has content previously available only on the website.

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:57.129
Also, all of the publications available in Watchtower Library are now available in the JW Library app and on Watchtower Online Library.

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:03.129
With so much content available, how can you find the articles or videos you're looking for?

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:07.129
The consolidated search feature on JW.org can help.

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:18.129
For example, if you want to learn more about Brother Harold King, who was imprisoned for his faith, type his name in the JW.org search box.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:29.110
That one search will provide you with a list of everything we've published on our website about Brother King, including any videos.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.110
Many of you enjoyed the search features of Watchtower Library.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.110
They're especially helpful when researching specific scriptures.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:46.110
You'll be happy to know that we plan to add similar search features to JW.org and to the JW Library app.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:59.110
In time, with JW.org and the JW Library app becoming such comprehensive research tools, we'll phase out Watchtower Online Library and Watchtower Library.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.110
Many of you prefer to use the JW Library app for personal study, as well as in the ministry.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:15.110
Perhaps you've noticed that we recently added a feature so that you can share digital publications directly from the JW Library app.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.110
Whether or not the recipient has downloaded the app.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:29.110
Yes, you can now send the publications link by text or email, allowing the recipient to access the information directly from JW.org.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.110
How does this share feature work?

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:43.620
Go to the article or video in the JW Library app, click Share, and send the link by means of a text or email.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.379
When the person clicks the link, he's taken to the same article or video on the website.

00:03:51.379 --> 00:04:00.379
There's no question that Jehovah is providing us with the tools we need to strengthen our faith and accomplish our ministry on a global scale.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:10.379
With the use of modern technology, we're able to publish content in about 1,000 languages, including those spoken by small populations.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:16.379
Surely what we see today reminds us of what the Apostle John saw in vision.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:20.379
He wrote in Revelation 14 verse 6,

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:33.379
And I saw another angel flying in mid-Heaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.379
For the Apostle, this was a miraculous vision.

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:42.379
Today, we might call this a miraculous reality.

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:52.379
It's our great honor to work with Jehovah and his angels in declaring everlasting good news to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people.
