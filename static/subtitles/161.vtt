00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.459
There are people who believe there is no need for a religious organization.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.900
They feel they have their own personal relationship with God, and that is good enough.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.500
They see no need to be associated with a specific organization.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.420
However, what does God's own inspired word suggest that He would use an organization

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.539
or channel through which spiritual food would be dispensed from His Word, the Bible.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.579
For example, 1 Peter 2 verse 17 says to have love for the whole association of brothers.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.939
One dictionary definition for association is an organization of persons having a common

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.179
interest.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:54.500
We have a very interesting, insightful look at the organization in the first century.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.659
If we glance down through chapter 15 of the book of Acts, we can gain some insight.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.579
Verse 1 indicates there was an issue that caused a disagreement between some of the members

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.819
of the congregation.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:15.659
Then verse 2 says, but after quite a bit of dissension and disputing by Paul and Barnabas

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.540
with them, it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas and some of the others to go up to the apostles

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.019
and elders in Jerusalem regarding this issue.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.939
Sounds like an organization to me.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.579
And after considerable discussion and with the help of God's Holy Spirit, what transpired?

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:46.099
Verses 22 and 23 say, then the apostles and the elders together with the whole congregation

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.939
decided to send chosen men from among them to Antioch, along with Paul and Barnabas.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.340
They sent Judas, who was called Barsabus and Silas, who were leading men among the brothers.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.780
They wrote this and sent it through them.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.700
Then in verses 23 through 29 is the letter of direction that was delivered to Antioch and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.460
other congregations as well.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.900
In fact, in verse 41, it says Paul and Silas went through Syria and Selissia strengthening

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.659
the congregations.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:24.300
After 16 verse 5 says, then indeed the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.259
to increase the number day by day.

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:33.979
So it was not a matter of isolated Christians sitting at home claiming to have a personal

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.939
relationship with God.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:43.539
No, the work was organized and congregations kept being added day by day.

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:47.580
It is very similar to what we see in Jehovah's organization today.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.620
In fact, the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses has patterned after the first century Christian

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.139
congregation as set forth in the scriptures.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.099
I would like to remind all of Jehovah's Witnesses whether already baptized or working toward

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.819
baptism of this book, organized to do Jehovah's will.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.979
It provides an overall view of how the Christian congregation is organized for getting God's

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.699
work done.

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:22.419
The book also offers counsel and direction to help us maintain unity with our brothers

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.620
worldwide.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.500
New ones need to become familiar with the operation of Jehovah's organization and learn

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.860
how they can have a share in the modern day preaching work.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.020
In fact, when a Bible student progresses and desires to join us in the ministry as an

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.219
unbaptized publisher, the elders direct him to make a study of this book, including the

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:51.259
questions for those desiring to get baptized in the appendix.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:56.379
Even for those of us who have been baptized many years, it may be good to schedule the

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:03.620
reading of one chapter of the book each week during our personal study or family worship.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.060
It contains general information concerning the duties of elders and ministerial servants,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.860
judicial procedures, and various other features of congregation organization.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.060
I would like to take a few minutes and review some of the information in chapter one of

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.899
the publication.

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:28.620
Though there are thousands of national and international organizations around the world,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.740
they are organized according to human viewpoints and philosophies.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.740
But our organization is different.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.540
It is theocratic.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.180
That means it is ruled by Jehovah as head overall.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:52.339
Isaiah chapter 33 verse 22 says, he is our judge, logiver, and king.

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:58.019
Many larger organizations appoint a chief executive officer or CEO.

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:04.620
He is the executive with the chief decision making authority in a business or corporation.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.939
In a similar way, Jehovah has appointed his son Jesus to be the one with chief decision

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:15.660
making authority over the congregation of God.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:23.620
Ephesians chapter 1 verse 22 is speaking of Jehovah's actions and connection with Jesus.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.540
And says, he also subjected all things under his feet and made him head over all things

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.420
with regard to the congregation.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.939
We see the structure of the organization taking shape.

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:45.019
Jehovah is the universal sovereign, the king, directing the millions of angels making

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.019
up his heavenly organization.

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:53.019
But when it comes to directing the visible earthly part of God's organization, he has

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:59.540
delegated that responsibility to Jesus, the head of the congregation of God.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.180
Chapter 2 of the organized book explains the scriptural position of Jesus.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.139
And how does Jesus direct the organization here on earth?

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:17.620
Matthew 24, 45 says that Jesus has appointed a faithful and discrete slave to serve spiritual

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.100
food at the proper time.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.579
Today, seven anointed men make up the faithful slave, and collectively, they are known as

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:28.379
the governing body.

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:34.660
And Jesus uses the Holy Spirit to direct these men in harmony with the scriptures.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:41.620
The scriptural basis for this layer of organization is set forth in chapter 3 of the book.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.740
Chapter 4 is titled, How the congregation is organized and governed.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.180
The organizational structure incorporates branch committees, circuit overseers, elders,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.459
and ministerial servants.

00:06:55.459 --> 00:07:02.060
The subject index in the back of the book can be useful to quickly gain access to information

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.259
on various aspects of the organization.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:11.420
Suppose you're a young person, maybe even a relatively young married couple.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.699
The circuit overseers visiting and he asks you what spiritual goals you have.

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.500
How would you answer?

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:25.379
Would your mind start racing trying to think of various avenues of service available?

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:32.220
How about now, before you are asked such a question, look in the subject index under

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.420
goals.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.019
There are eleven references to paragraphs in the book on that subject.

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:44.860
After reading about all of the possibilities and different categories you'd be in a better

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:53.939
position to plan your life for a great future in the earthly part of Jehovah's organization.

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:59.899
At this time, I would like to draw your attention to a very important factor in a new one's

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:05.060
making progress and attaining spiritual stability.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:14.220
On page 213 of the organized book, it discusses a person interested in being baptized.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.579
After the elders go over the questions in part three of the book, it says this, if he

00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:24.939
has not completed his study of the Bible teach in God's love books, the elders should make

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:30.459
arrangements for someone to help him do so.

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:35.500
The two books complement each other so well.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.100
When someone becomes a dedicated and baptized servant of Jehovah, we want him to stay closely

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.860
attached to the organization.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:50.220
Yet every year, there are a number who stop attending meetings and become inactive.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:56.100
At times, it has been found that they did not finish studying the two books.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:02.139
You see, the Bible Teachbook helps new ones to have an accurate knowledge of the Bible,

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:05.139
and they often learn to love Jehovah.

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:10.419
To keep yourselves in God's love book helps us to learn to apply the Bible and live

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:13.779
in harmony with Jehovah's standards.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:23.580
Notice what Jesus told His faithful apostles at John chapter 15 and verse 10.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.620
If you observe my commandments, you will remain in my love just as I have observed the

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.100
commandments of the Father and remain in His love.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.500
Did you notice that Jesus remained in God's love by observing His Father's commandments?

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.980
The same is true of us today.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:49.019
To remain in God's love, we need to apply the truth in our everyday life.

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:53.179
And what is the result if we keep ourselves in God's love?

00:09:53.179 --> 00:10:02.580
It is so clearly stated in Jude, verse 21, in order to keep yourselves in God's love

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:09.940
while you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with ever-lasting life in view.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:15.019
Staying in God's love results in ever-lasting life.

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:21.100
It is so important to make sure our Bible students complete a study of both books, and

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.419
that applies to our children too.

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:29.460
Sometimes as parents, we can assume that our children are developing a trusting relationship

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.740
with Jehovah because they have been going to meeting since they were very small.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:40.019
A relationship with Jehovah does not happen by means of osmosis.

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:46.419
A child does not simply absorb and assimilate truth and a love for God just by being in the

00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:51.860
presence of others who have a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.659
We very much appreciate all the videos we have including become Jehovah's friend and

00:10:57.659 --> 00:11:05.419
JW broadcasting, but new ones and young ones need to be able to go through the process

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:12.100
of deep study to get to the Bible's truth and it is etched into their minds and lodged

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.820
deep into their hearts.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:20.539
Therefore, if you parents realize that you have not studied both books with your young

00:11:20.539 --> 00:11:27.100
ones, it would be good to see that a schedule is established to do so.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.899
The governing body gives all credit for the success of this organization to Jehovah

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:37.379
and the appointed head of the congregation Jesus Christ.

00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:42.539
We are just imperfect men trying to follow the lead of Christ in the Holy Spirit.

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:51.379
At 1 Corinthians chapter 1, verse 26, Paul says, if you see his calling of your brothers

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:58.759
that there are not many wise in a fleshly way, verse 27 says, but God shows the foolish

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:02.860
things of the world to put the wise men to shame.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:10.460
Then verse 30 says that Christ Jesus has become to us wisdom from God.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:16.659
That is where the direction and wisdom of the organization comes from, not from mere

00:12:16.659 --> 00:12:18.700
man.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:24.179
The words of Jehovah to the prophet Zechariah fit today when we see the amazing advances

00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:26.419
in the organization.

00:12:26.419 --> 00:12:34.620
Zechariah 4.6 says, not by a military force nor by power, but by my spirit says Jehovah

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.740
of armies.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.820
While there are some well-educated and prominent men who have accepted the truth and are now

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:48.539
our fellow brothers, the majority in the organization come from a more humble background.

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:53.620
For example, among the first of Jehovah's modern-day servants who introduced the kingdom

00:12:53.620 --> 00:13:00.980
message to people in Denmark was a shoemaker, in Switzerland and France it was a gardener.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.940
In many parts of Africa, the message was carried by itinerant workers.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.220
In Brazil, sailors had a share.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:15.379
Quite a few of the Polish witnesses in northern France were coal miners.

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:20.940
Often Jesus used all of us to get a remarkable work accomplished.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.379
We are proud to be a part of this spirit directed organization.

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:31.460
As one older circuit overseer was heard to say, this is the best imperfect organization

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.899
on earth.

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:41.220
There are no perfect organizations on earth, however, this is the best of them all.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.860
And we appreciate the contribution all of you made to the success of the preaching work

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.659
worldwide.
