00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.699
My name is Mascar Mahamba.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.699
I love the preaching work.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.699
However, my various illnesses prevent me

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.699
from giving my all in the ministry.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.699
My first wife died, and we had six children.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.699
I was alone with the six children,

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.700
and then I married Beatrice, who has five children.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.700
Since we are living in the last days of the system,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.700
it is not easy.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.700
I like the example of Jesus who was passionate

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.700
about preaching the message that he shared.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
But at the same time, he took into account the suffering

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.700
of the people of his time.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.700
He would take time to show kindness, to encourage, and to heal.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.700
The branch sees where there is a need,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.700
and then organizes a humanitarian mission.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.700
I believe I can use my medical skills to help our brothers.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
It is love.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Not just inviting, but in action.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.700
It's a real joy to help these brothers

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.700
who need us in remote locations, far from town.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:02:05.129
It is always a pleasure.

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.129
Both the two are the same.

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.129
Both Edrams are completely perforated.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:34.560
Well, we are here in the village of Wali Khaled,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.560
in the middle of the forest.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.560
On the main road, well, the only road in the village

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.560
it saves us our lives.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.560
I can't bear to see anyone suffer,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.560
so I use all my skills to try to find a solution.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.560
What moves me to help the brothers is what Jesus said,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.939
that there is more happiness in giving than in receiving.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.939
Oh, a long day, really, very tiring.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.939
But at the same time, there was an encouraging case,

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.939
brother Minya Karaguay, 68 years old, 10 years in regular,

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.939
per-near service, and he has 15 Bible studies.

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.939
This brother came from the territory on the motorcycle.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.939
He took him two and a half hours on a very rough road,

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.939
instead of an hour and a half,

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.939
because he has a paralyzed leg.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.939
And he was able to go back to his field service,

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.939
well, with some medication.

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.939
So it was really encouraging to see him getting on the motorcycle

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.939
with a smile on his face.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:47.530
These are mosquito nets for those in need,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.530
and there's a big need here,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.530
so we give them to each family.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.530
You know to protect your baby,

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.530
one of the best things is for him to sleep under a mosquito net.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.539
Jehovah has done well,

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.539
because he has gone through you to provide us with care.

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.539
We are very grateful.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.539
We thank the many brothers who have volunteered to service.

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:13.539
I thank Jehovah, because without him,

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:17.540
our identifying mark of unity wouldn't exist.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.540
You have helped me. I had this problem for two years.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.540
Now I'm so happy.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.540
I will be able to hear at the meetings again. Thank you.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.540
The brothers are aware that they must thank Jehovah,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.540
and we ourselves are aware that all of this is possible.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.540
Thanks to Jehovah's Holy Spirit and his organization.
