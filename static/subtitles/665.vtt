00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:11.019
Zambia is a landlocked country in southern Africa and it's bordered by eight other countries.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:19.780
It has a population of 14.5 million and we have 180,000 witnesses.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.500
That's one witness for every 82 people.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.899
In the last two years, 13,500 were baptized.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.100
That's an average of 19 each day.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.700
And as prospects for more, we have 400,000 Bible studies.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:55.060
Our memorial attendance this year was 802,000 that's one person out of every 18 in the country.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.460
So you can see that Zambia really is ripe for harvesting.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.680
To handle it, we've built 1,800 kingdom halls.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.040
Now some brothers ask us, why is Zambia so productive?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:24.359
Well, it's a very fertile country in the sense that people are humble, friendly and God-fearing.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:30.040
And Jehovah's blessing the efforts of the publishers, the average 11 and a half hours,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.040
and we've got 13,847 regular pioneers.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.200
So it's Jehovah's blessing really, but it's the people.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.400
Another contributing factor is that people are getting publications in their own language.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:55.560
At present, we're translating in 18 languages at 10 locations, remote translation offices,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.840
and summer in the branch.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.680
When people get the literature in their own tongue, it really goes right to their heart.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.520
One old man received a publication in his language, and when he got it, he said, at last,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.080
this is the treasure that I've been looking for.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.280
And he sat down and he read it on the spot by the end of the day, he'd finished a Bible

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.300
study was started, and it's progressing nicely, and he's asking for more treasure.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:42.539
One of the highlights of 2014 was when brother Stephen Let came to release a new world translation

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:49.500
in two languages, the Ki Kaundi language and the Chitonga language.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.419
He gave his talks to an excited audience, a combined audience of 95,000, making this

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.900
the largest conventions ambias ever seen.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.300
Another milestone was when brother Lush came to release another Bible in the vernacular

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.979
language, the Lou Valley language, and at the same time, he dedicated our first purpose-built

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.939
remote translation office.

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.939
The brothers were thrilled, and they were amazed to think that a brother would travel all

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:30.259
the way from the United States, come to Lusac, Mozambia, and then have to travel another

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:35.620
thousand kilometers in the bush to the interior of the country in order to talk to them.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.460
They couldn't believe it, and they're very impressed.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:47.340
Traveling over his years worked very hard to faithfully serve isolated congregations, and

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.460
we've got a lot of these in the bush of Africa.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.939
Now one couple serves a circuit with very deep sand.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.819
They travel by ox cart between congregations.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.259
Now I'd like you to use your imagination and come with them on a recent trip that they

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:11.340
made, and this is real.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.620
We start the journey after sunset, because it's cooler them.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.699
After a few hours, the axle breaks.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.779
Now two of the brothers that were accompanying them started walking back to try to find

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:30.980
another ox cart.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.459
So now imagine you are there in the middle of the bush.

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:42.180
You prepare for the night, but then the brother with us has spotted lion tracks, fresh lion

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.860
tracks in the sand, and it sends a shiver up just by.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.939
You tie up the oxen a little away away so that the lions will go for them first, you

00:04:52.939 --> 00:05:03.199
hope, and then you build a big fire to scare them away if they come.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.480
If you'll save your lie down, but then it pours with rain, the fires put out, you're

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:20.639
soaking wet, afraid, cold, miserable, and you pray that you're over for his protection.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.879
You spend a rough night, then at four in the morning you hear their whip, a crackable

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.480
whip, and it's brothers coming with another ox cart.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.399
You continue your journey.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:38.889
You arrive at midday the next day, relieved and happy to have made it.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.170
So you can see that's just one little example there of what some of our traveling overseers

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:53.019
have to put up with.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.740
Now in this circuit, there's no internet.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.180
There's no cell phone coverage.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.220
Brothers have never seen JW.org and they haven't had the privilege of watching JW broadcasting

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.220
either.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.500
So you can see we've still got a long way to go.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.459
In the town's things are improving and we look forward to better times ahead.

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:21.740
So brothers, it's been a pleasure to bring this report to you and to bring the warm love

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.620
and greetings from your brothers in Sanmehameha.
