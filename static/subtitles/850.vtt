00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:16.239
When did we begin reporting field service activity?

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:25.760
Prior to 1920, only coal porters, as pioneers were then called, were asked to submit reports.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.519
But beginning in 1920, everyone in the congregation who participated in the witness work was asked

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.159
to turn in a weekly report.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:41.679
The 1920 annual service report for the United States was the first to include the activity

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.679
of congregation publishers.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:53.079
The report revealed that there were 8,052 class workers or publishers and 350 pioneers

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.240
active in the preaching work.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.920
Twice a year during the late 1920s, one week was designated for a special worldwide witnessing

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.920
campaign.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.099
Pioneers had a goal of 40 hours for that special week.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:16.459
In January 1939, a suggestion was placed before congregation publishers.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.780
A goal of 60 hours per month.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.579
Early on, congregation field service reports were thorough.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.420
Over the years, the forms used to report publishers field service activity have been simplified.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.260
Reports have consistently included back calls or return visits, Bible studies, publication

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.700
placements, and hours spent in the disciple making work.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.500
As was the case back then, there's always a story behind a field service report.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.459
The first time I walked into a kingdom hall, when I was 16, I saw this chart on the stage.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:05.060
And I realized this organization is concerned about what we do, what we say, and how much

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.540
we say about Jehovah.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.620
I realized that from the start, so that after the third month of studying, when I started

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.460
going out in field service, I wanted to turn my time in, too.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.620
And they showed me how to do it, and I've been turning it ever since.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.460
Allen and I were invited into the Special Pioneer Service in 1966.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.659
The monthly requirement was 150 hours, and 50 return visits.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.539
It was a good incentive.

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:39.500
What we had a quota back then of 150 magazines, one for every hour, a special pioneers or

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.740
missionaries, and one day we run into our fellow missionary and his wife on the way to

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.740
the movies.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.419
They went every Saturday, every Saturday, but this particular Saturday says, I can't go

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:56.300
to the movies because I don't have my 150 magazines, so I've got five more to go, and

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.060
then we can go to the movies.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.340
Let's start in 1961, wouldn't it?

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:11.819
We were sent a special pioneer in a trailer of five hours of service every day.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.740
And getting our time was no problem.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.379
Living for a month or $100, that was a problem.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.620
So Dave said, I'm going to go out and get a job, about that time they had put a new store

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.620
in town.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.620
Beautiful.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.780
He would now do that store and told them, I'm going to work one day a week.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.580
What are you going to do the rest of the time?

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:49.060
So he said, well, I'd knock on doors and tell them about God's kingdom, it's really.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.419
This is my door, knock on it.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.659
He came in the truth, his wife came in the truth, children are in the truth.

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.259
And they had a secretary, didn't they?

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.939
She had seven children.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:11.219
And she said, well, I'd like to study the Bible too, and we would study with seven after

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:12.219
they had supper.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.699
And the beauty of it is that they did so well.

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:16.699
Yeah.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:23.819
After that, we studied with the parents, so the time we got through it was probably almost

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:24.819
midnight.

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:27.699
And we took our circuit over to you there.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.500
But he said, I'm too old for this midnight shift.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.699
I never felt it was a question of getting the hours in.

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.980
I always try to make them quality calls, you know, try to say something with the people,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.899
not just go there and get the magazines placed.

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:48.899
Or my Bible studies, I would try so hard to really get to know the people.

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:51.540
But it was never just a question of getting an hours.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.139
We're trying to save lives.
