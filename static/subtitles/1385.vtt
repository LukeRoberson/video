00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.300
I've really enjoyed our Bible Studies, Tony, even though it's been a challenge for you to study every week, we always have good discussions.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Yeah. I like what you show me from the Bible. It's so different from my church.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:21.300
As we considered before, Jehovah wants people to come to an accurate knowledge of truth, like it says at 1 Timothy 2-4.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
But there's more to it than that.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300
What do you mean?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Well, imagine for a moment that you lived along the coast where there's a danger of tsunamis.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.299
If you heard a tsunami warning, would you be saved if you just recognized the warning and knew how to evacuate?

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:39.299
No, I'd have to get out of the danger zone.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:45.299
Exactly. So do we truly benefit if we only learn what Jehovah requires of us?

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:48.299
No, I guess not.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.299
Jesus gave an excellent illustration about the need to apply what we learn.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.299
It's found at Matthew chapter 13, verses 18-23.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.299
Would you please read that for us, Tony?

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.299
Sure, it says, now listen to the illustration of the man who sowed.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.299
As for the one sown upon the fine soil, this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:18.299
who really does bear fruit and produces. This won 100 times more, that won 60, the other 30.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.299
Thank you.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.299
So of all the situations Jesus describes, which one do you think resembles yours the most?

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.299
Um, I don't really know.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.299
Well, let's look again at the example of the one sown upon the fine soil.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.299
According to verse 23, how did he respond after hearing the word?

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.299
He got the sense of it and produced fruit.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.299
Right. So he responded to what he learned and made the needed changes.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.299
What about the other three in Jesus' illustration?

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.299
Something prevented them from responding.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.299
Exactly.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.299
You know, I want to do what Jehovah wants, but it's hard these days, precious from every side.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.299
I mean, you know how it is, the job, the bills, the kids, the boss.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.300
It's challenging to seek God's kingdom first and to balance all of our other responsibilities.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.300
But it is possible.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.300
I remember when I first started studying, everybody opposed me, even my wife.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.300
Not only that, I drank a lot.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:33.300
I had to make a lot of changes, but I prayed to Jehovah specifically about what I needed to work on.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.300
So I started coming to meetings right away.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.300
Being with the congregation helped me to apply what I was learning.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.300
I really could see how Jehovah was blessing my efforts.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.300
He became my father and my friend.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.300
I really tried to apply James 4.8.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.300
It says, draw close to God.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.300
And he would draw close to you.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300
Yeah, I remember that verse.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.300
So how long did it take for you to become a witness?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.300
Well, each person is different.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.300
For me, from the time I started studying until I dedicated my life to Jehovah and got baptized,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.300
it was a couple of years.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.300
I'm so happy I started attending meetings and never looked back.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.300
I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of commitment, maybe someday.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.300
We appreciate your honesty.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.300
For now, though, it's best that we discontinue the Bible study.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.300
I'll stop by from time to time to see how you're doing and to share a scriptural thought.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.300
But keep thinking about Jehovah's warm invitation and his promise at James 4.8.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.300
Talk to him specifically about your challenges and the changes you want to make to please him.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.300
And you know the schedule for our meetings at the Kingdom Hall?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.300
We'd love to see you there.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.300
If you'd like to resume the study at some point, let me know.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.300
You have my contact information.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.300
Thanks. I appreciate that.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.300
Let's say a prayer.
