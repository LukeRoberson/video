00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.780
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.779
Let's look briefly at some of the items that have been prepared for you.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:14.779
You'll meet a brother from Russia who was born in a labour camp in Siberia

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.780
and was later in prison for his faith.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:25.780
But in spite of many challenges, he has always kept his joy and trusted in Jehovah.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.780
You will also enjoy learning more about the preaching work in the countries of Tanzania,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.780
Kenya and Malawi.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.780
We joined a headquarters representative on his recent visit to these African countries.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.780
And have you ever wondered how the truth reaches individuals inside prison walls?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.780
Let's find out.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.780
You'll enjoy hearing the experience of how a former inmate drew close to Jehovah while in prison.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.780
This is the June program of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.530
This month we'll discuss something that is treasured by all of God's people,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.530
no matter where we live and no matter what language we speak.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.530
Our subject is the divine name of our Heavenly Father.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.530
As you realise in the Hebrew that name is represented by four Hebrew letters

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.530
they can be transliterated into English as YHWH or JHVH.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.530
And this Hebrew name is commonly pronounced in English as Jehovah.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.530
Acts chapter 15 verses 14 and 17 tells us that Jehovah has taken out from the nations

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
a people for his name.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.530
And we are proud to be the people who bear his name today as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.530
By contrast, most religions that claim to follow the Bible no longer accept or honour that holy name.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.530
In some cases they have purged it from their copies of the Bible and even banned its use in their church services.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.530
But as serious students of God's word we're not surprised by this turn of events.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.530
Notice please the words that are recorded in Jeremiah 23 and verse 27.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.530
Here Jehovah speaks of those who are false prophets.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.530
Notice what he said that they would try to do.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.530
They intend to make my people forget my name.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.870
Can someone really be made to forget his Father's name?

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.870
As impossible as that may seem, that's exactly what Satan has been trying to do.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.870
Make people forget Jehovah's name.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.870
How vital it is that we continue to declare Jehovah's name to all, near and far.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:26.539
But why do so many translators remove Jehovah's name from their translations of the Bible and replace it with such titles as Lord or God?

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:32.539
In this month's program we're going to examine two of the common reasons that they give.

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:37.539
We'll also see why those reasons are not valid at all.

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:46.539
And in so doing we will enhance our appreciation for the new world translation of the Holy Scriptures.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:52.539
So what is one reason given for removing God's name from the Bible?

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:59.539
Some translators have said that they're following an ancient Jewish tradition.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:06.539
An example of this is found in the preface of a translation that was released in 1935.

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:09.539
It's said in part and I'll quote it.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:19.540
In this translation we have followed the Orthodox Jewish tradition and substituted the Lord for the name Yahweh.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.540
And the phrase the Lord God for the phrase the Lord Yahweh.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.540
And of quote.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.540
It's true that at one point in history the Jewish people stop pronouncing God's name when they were reading aloud from the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.540
However, please note these important facts.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:51.540
First of all, although because of superstition the Jews stop pronouncing God's name out loud, they never removed it from the Scriptures.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:59.540
In fact, even today if you buy a Hebrew Bible in Israel you can see the four letters forming the tetragramatine.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.540
These letters are still found thousands of times in the Hebrew text of the Bible.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:14.540
Another point, the Jewish people even use the tetragramatine in their rabbinical writings such as the Mishnah.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:24.540
And yet another point, interestingly, scholars who translated the Christian Greek Scriptures into Hebrew in the 16th century CE

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:34.540
naturally included the divine name when rendering quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures because it's found in all standard Hebrew texts.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:41.540
So it wasn't the Jewish people who removed God's name from the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:53.540
Rather it was apostate Christians who took the tradition one step further and actually removed the name of God from the translations of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:03.100
Still, as mentioned earlier, the Jews did adopt the tradition of not pronouncing God's name.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.100
Jesus warned the Jewish people of His day about clinging to their traditions.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:19.100
He even said as recorded in Matthew 15 verses 3 through 6 that they made the Word of God invalid by means of their traditions.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.100
Of course, not all traditions are automatically wrong, are they?

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.100
But is the tradition of refusing to pronounce the divine name reasonable?

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.100
Is it applied consistently? No.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.100
We can say so for three reasons.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:52.100
The first reason, the practice may have developed due to an extremist interpretation of the third commandment as stated at Exodus 20 verse 7, which says,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.100
you must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.100
However, that very Bible verse uses God's name twice.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:13.100
Many other verses, such as Psalm 148 verse 13, encourage us to praise the name of Jehovah.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:21.100
The second reason, the Jews continued to pronounce the divine name as part of their personal names.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:30.100
Name such as Joshua, Hezekiah, Isaiah, Jeremiah and many others contained part of Jehovah's name.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:37.100
So every time the Jews used these names, they were in fact pronouncing part of Jehovah's name.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:47.100
The third reason, Jehovah had his name recorded thousands of times in the Bible for our benefit and our use.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:53.100
If he didn't want us to use his name, then why did he reveal it to mankind?

00:07:53.100 --> 00:08:00.100
When Manoa asked Jehovah's Angel as recorded in Judges 13, 17 and 18,

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.100
what is your name so that we may honor you when your word comes true?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.100
Jehovah's Angel said to him, why are you asking about my name?

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.100
Seeing that it is a wonderful one.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:19.100
The angel refused to reveal his name to Manoa.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.100
Jehovah could have done the same, but he didn't.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.100
He told us his name.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:36.100
So rather than trying to follow a so-called ancient Jewish tradition, we follow the example of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:50.860
Notice what he said in prayer to his father as recorded in John 17 and verse 26.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:09:05.009
I have made your name known to them and will make it known so that the love with which you love me may be in them and I in union with them.

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:17.009
Another reason often given by translators for not using God's name in the text of their translations is that they don't know the exact pronunciation of the original name.

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:25.009
Some scholars feel that the original pronunciation was closer to Yahweh rather than Jehovah.

00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:29.009
Others feel that it may have been Jehovah.

00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:36.009
Just how important is the exact pronunciation of the original Hebrew name?

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:42.009
Could we get sidetracked by trying to determine what that pronunciation was?

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:50.009
Well first of all, let's establish why we use the pronunciation Jehovah in English.

00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:55.009
Is it because it's the closest pronunciation to the original?

00:09:55.009 --> 00:10:02.009
No. We use the name Jehovah because it's widely recognized in English.

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:06.009
Is this a reasonable position to take?

00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:10.009
Yes. That's what we do in other languages.

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:17.009
Usually we don't try to say Jehovah's name exactly the same way in every language.

00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:32.009
For example, in some of the languages of the South Pacific where I served as a missionary, the divine name is pronounced as Jehovah or Jehovah.

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:40.009
Each pronunciation was established by local Bible translations and influenced by language characteristics.

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:45.009
These pronunciations became well established and familiar to people.

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:53.009
So it would be unreasonable to try to make people pronounce the name exactly the same in every language.

00:10:54.009 --> 00:11:03.009
You may not have thought of this but even in English some of us say the name slightly differently because of our different accents.

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:15.009
Some say Jehovah, others Jehovah, others Jehovah or Jehovah.

00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:18.009
So what's the point?

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:26.009
The pronunciation changes according to the rules of language or even due to individual accent.

00:11:26.009 --> 00:11:32.009
So it's not necessary to try and say the divine name exactly the same way as in Hebrew.

00:11:32.009 --> 00:11:37.009
In English the pronunciation Jehovah has a long history.

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:40.009
It goes back hundreds of years.

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:50.009
The first rendering of God's personal name in an English Bible appeared in 1530 in William Tindell's translation of the Pentateuch.

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:54.009
He used the form Jehovah.

00:11:54.009 --> 00:12:02.009
Over time the English language changed and the spelling of the divine name was modernized to become Jehovah.

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:10.340
It's true though that some scholars would prefer Yahweh instead of Jehovah.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.340
One such scholar was Joseph Rotherham.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:21.340
When he originally translated the Rotherham emphasized Bible a literal translation in 1902.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:27.340
He used God's name in his translation but preferred the form Yahweh.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:37.340
However just a few years later in 1911 when he published his studies in the Psalms he returned to the form Jehovah.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:47.340
Why? Well he still felt that Yahweh was a more accurate pronunciation but he used the form Jehovah.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:56.340
He said because and I quote of the desirability of keeping in touch with the public here and I in a matter of this kind.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:04.340
In which the principal thing is the easy recognition of the divine name end of quote.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:11.340
In other words the name Jehovah was more commonly used in English.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:18.340
But shouldn't we try to be as close as possible with our pronunciation of the divine name?

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:29.340
As already mentioned scholars do not agree on the exact pronunciation but even if they did that's not what is done with other names in the Bible.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.340
For example let's consider the name Jesus.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:39.340
That's the common pronunciation in English for the name of God's Son.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:44.340
But imagine please if you were to go back in time to Jesus' day.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:54.340
If you were to stand in public and call out the name Jesus in English would anyone know who you were referring to?

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.340
That would be unlikely.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:10.340
At that time Jesus' name was probably pronounced even as either as Yeshua or Yahoshua as in Hebrew or Isus as in Greek.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:17.340
And I'm sure you'll agree both of those forms are quite different from our English pronunciation.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:25.340
Consider to this fact Jehovah didn't require that his son's name be spelled and pronounced the Hebrew way

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.340
when the Christian Greek scriptures were written.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:38.340
He allowed the writers to use the common equivalent for Jesus' name in Greek even though it sounded a lot different from how it was pronounced in Hebrew.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:47.340
Likewise today Jesus' name is pronounced differently in Spanish, in Italian and in German and many other languages.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:57.340
So should we stop using the name Jesus because it was not pronounced that way in Hebrew or because it was pronounced differently in other languages?

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.340
Of course not.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:12.340
It's also worth noting that in Hebrew Jesus' name had either three or four syllables according to how it may have been pronounced either Yeshua or Yahoshua.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.340
But in English there are only two syllables in the name Jesus.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:23.340
Obviously the number of syllables is not the main factor to be concerned about.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:39.340
In a similar way we don't want to be sidetracked by arguing about the number of syllables in Jehovah's name in Hebrew, whether it should be three syllables as in Jehovah or just two as in Yahweh.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:46.340
The main thing is that we use whatever pronunciation is common in our language.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:53.340
The worst thing we could do is suppress the name of God by failing or refusing to use it.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:59.340
How grateful we are to have the new world translation of the Holy Scriptures.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:11.340
This translation is now available in part or in whole in 128 languages and 39 more languages are in the process of being translated.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:26.340
Not only is this a clear, accurate translation of God's Word but more importantly it honors the name of Almighty God over 7000 times by translating it and not hiding it.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:34.340
What a privilege we have to know and use the personal name of our loving Father Jehovah.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:41.870
Have you had the opportunity to use the video does God have a name?

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.870
Many have used it to introduce the brochure good news from God.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.870
That's the brochure the video is based on.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:55.870
You'll be happy to know that another video in the same series has been prepared.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:00.870
It is entitled, how can we be sure the Bible is true?

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:11.690
Some accuse the Bible of being a collection of myths and legends written by well-intentioned humans.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:18.690
By contrast, the Bible says that it is the Word of God who cannot lie.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:26.509
If the Bible was authored by God, it should be like no other book ever written.

00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:36.619
For example, when it mentions scientific matters, what it says should be in harmony with proved science.

00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:43.619
When it foretells the future, those prophecies should come through 100% of the time.

00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:54.619
And if the Bible contains God's message to mankind, it should be available no matter where a person lives and no matter what is done to stop its distribution.

00:17:54.619 --> 00:17:59.619
Is the Bible full of myths or is it accurate?

00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:06.619
Consider just some of the evidence indicating that the Bible is truly an extraordinary and trustworthy book.

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:15.619
During the time when the Bible was written, many people had mistaken ideas about the shape of the earth.

00:18:15.619 --> 00:18:22.619
A theory written after the Bible was completed was that the universe emerged from a cosmic egg

00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:27.619
and that the earth is supported by various creatures.

00:18:27.619 --> 00:18:36.619
In contrast, about the year 1473 BCE, Moses wrote that the earth is suspended upon nothing.

00:18:36.619 --> 00:18:43.619
And around the year 732 BCE, the prophet Isaiah wrote that the earth is a circle or sphere.

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:49.619
These Bible writers contradicted ideas that were popular at the time.

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:57.619
It was some 200 years after Isaiah's day that the Greek philosopher, Pythagoras, may have proposed that the earth is a sphere.

00:18:57.619 --> 00:19:07.619
And more than 3000 years passed from Moses' writing until scientists such as Isaac Newton realized that the earth seemed to hang upon nothing.

00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:18.700
No human can foretell the future in exact detail.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:27.700
Yet about the year 732 BCE, the prophet Isaiah foretell that a man named Cyrus would conquer the mighty city of Babylon,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:34.700
that he would dry up a river, and that he would enter the city through open gates.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.700
History confirms that every detail of this prophecy was fulfilled.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:48.700
Concerning the same city, the prophet Jeremiah foretell that Babylon would become piles of stones and never again be inhabited.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:57.210
Despite its strategic location, Babylon eventually became a pile of stones and remains that way.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:04.210
Throughout history, powerful men have tried to stop the distribution or translation of the Bible.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:13.579
They burned at the stake those who translated it into common languages and persecuted those who read it.

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:18.579
The Bible has weathered the most sustained attack of any book in history.

00:20:18.579 --> 00:20:23.579
Yet it has become the most widely translated and published book of all time.

00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:29.579
Billions of copies have been produced in some 2700 languages.

00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:38.579
The Bible is scientifically accurate, contains reliable prophecy, and is available to all mankind.

00:20:38.579 --> 00:20:44.579
You have good reason to believe that it is inspired by Jehovah, the God who cannot lie.

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:50.579
Still, you may ask, who is the author of the Bible? What is the Bible about?

00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:53.579
How can you understand the Bible?

00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:58.579
Those questions are answered in lesson 3 of the brochure, good news from God.

00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:01.579
You can download a copy from JW.org.

00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:06.890
Jehovah's Witnesses will be happy to study the Bible with you.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:15.890
Fill in the online request for a Bible study, and a witness in your area will call to discuss the Bible at a time and place convenient for you.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:21.509
I look forward to using that video in the ministry.

00:21:21.509 --> 00:21:25.509
And did you notice that early in the video, the narrator said,

00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:33.509
if the Bible is God's message to mankind, it should be available no matter where a person lives.

00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:42.509
That fact echoes the words of the Apostle Peter in Acts 10, verses 34 and 35, where he says,

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:54.509
Now I truly understand that God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.

00:21:54.509 --> 00:22:04.509
Knowing this about Jehovah's personality, we can be certain that there will soon be a time when all discrimination has been removed.

00:22:05.509 --> 00:22:12.509
In some parts of the world, our brothers and sisters endure discrimination every day.

00:22:12.509 --> 00:22:16.509
That was the case in South Africa during apartheid.

00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:25.509
The word apartheid means separateness, and was a political policy that was implemented in the country in 1948.

00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:32.509
By means of that policy, the government enforced strict separation of various racial groups.

00:22:32.509 --> 00:22:41.509
For example, public facilities such as banks and post offices had separate sections for whites and non-whites,

00:22:41.509 --> 00:22:47.509
but restaurants and cinemas were reserved for whites only.

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:53.509
This continued until the apartheid policy was dismantled in 1994.

00:22:54.509 --> 00:23:04.509
But how can someone who was heavily involved in the separation of races be drawn to a God that is not partial?

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:15.819
We met two of our brothers in South Africa with just such a background.

00:23:15.819 --> 00:23:22.819
I was a leader in a far-right organization that actively supported apartheid in the 1980s.

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:27.819
We were on holiday at the sea and there were only black lifeguards.

00:23:27.819 --> 00:23:34.819
I said to my friends with me that I would rather drown before I would allow a black man to rescue me in the sea.

00:23:34.819 --> 00:23:42.819
The second day we were there, the current pulled me out to sea, and the harder I tried to come out, the deeper the sea pulled me in.

00:23:42.819 --> 00:23:49.819
The next moment I see this black man coming towards me, and I grab him around the neck and I almost wanted to kiss him.

00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:56.819
That is how glad I was to see him, because I was drowning. I was totally exhausted. I could not go on.

00:23:56.819 --> 00:24:05.829
Even though a black man saved my life, it did not change my attitude towards them.

00:24:05.829 --> 00:24:13.829
I wanted to see South African society or community as non-racial, non-sexist, democratic society.

00:24:13.829 --> 00:24:21.829
Before I was 21 years old, already I get involved in political education.

00:24:21.829 --> 00:24:27.829
And I became a chairman of mass democratic movement.

00:24:27.829 --> 00:24:32.829
For the first time South Africans were supposed to be educated on election.

00:24:32.829 --> 00:24:38.829
We found that Jehovah's Witnesses, they also have a church in our community.

00:24:38.829 --> 00:24:46.829
We asked them, can we come and teach the people how to elect in that part of the community.

00:24:46.829 --> 00:24:56.829
And we were told that this is a church that cannot allow us to teach people elections in their premises, the militant one.

00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:59.829
They wanted to go and bend the church.

00:24:59.829 --> 00:25:05.829
One day we were driving as a delegation, we were black and white in that vehicle.

00:25:05.829 --> 00:25:11.829
And we saw white witnesses were doing their public ministry.

00:25:11.829 --> 00:25:21.829
And this driver, who I know you was racist, he said to me, Tony, do you see those white people?

00:25:21.829 --> 00:25:24.829
I said, yes, he said, I hate those people.

00:25:24.829 --> 00:25:28.829
I said, why? He said, no, I hate these people.

00:25:28.829 --> 00:25:35.529
And I said, if they are hated by you, who is white? They must be good people.

00:25:35.529 --> 00:25:40.529
Time started to change in the late 80s when they started to dismantle a part that.

00:25:40.529 --> 00:25:43.529
But we aggressively tried to stop this from happening.

00:25:43.529 --> 00:25:48.529
We even drove an armored vehicle smashing through the doors into the parliament buildings.

00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:53.529
We were trying to see if we could resist these changes with a part that.

00:25:53.529 --> 00:25:56.529
But this did not change things.

00:25:56.529 --> 00:26:02.529
Even though I belonged to a church, I still drank heavily and had extramarital affairs.

00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:05.529
This led to me and my wife getting divorced.

00:26:05.529 --> 00:26:09.529
It was an empty life. I was never really happy.

00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:19.390
I was committed to the three-volutionary course.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:24.390
I would be absent, not at home, for the weeks.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.390
One of politics is about Ajunit.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.390
Ed political meetings, a lot of Ajuin take place.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:35.390
When you go home, you end up Ajuin with your wife over nothing.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:41.829
I came to another office and I saw in a desk of this colleague,

00:26:41.829 --> 00:26:46.829
there's a book called Knowledge that can lead to a elastic life.

00:26:46.829 --> 00:26:50.829
When I found in the book, the reason why Jesus was on earth,

00:26:50.829 --> 00:26:55.829
especially to proclaim the kingdom, and this kingdom is a government.

00:26:55.829 --> 00:27:00.829
And I worked for government, yet I have never had about this government.

00:27:00.829 --> 00:27:07.829
Then I found out of the book, this is a real government that will come and solve all mankind problems.

00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:10.829
I fell home among the others people.

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:18.829
I can feel genuine love, not just love, that we have in the world or anywhere.

00:27:19.829 --> 00:27:23.829
Then I came. I never stopped attending meetings.

00:27:23.829 --> 00:27:27.829
A friend of mine introduced me to the witnesses.

00:27:27.829 --> 00:27:30.829
One of the brothers I met asked me,

00:27:30.829 --> 00:27:36.829
if I prove from the Bible that something you believe is incorrect, what will you do?

00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:39.829
I said, then I will become a witness.

00:27:39.829 --> 00:27:47.829
He went on to show me in the Bible how the Bethlehem star was actually from the devil to lead the wise men to kill Jesus.

00:27:47.829 --> 00:27:52.829
This changed my whole life. I said, now I can become a witness.

00:27:52.829 --> 00:28:02.250
Being in the kingdom hall, I noticed that there were many black people.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:09.250
This was strange for me, but the more I attended, the more I began to learn that with Jehovah, there is no partiality.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.250
All people are equal.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:19.670
We began to accept that this is the way it should be.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.670
Johnny and I were brought together, even though we were from completely different political parties.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:29.670
Before we would have wanted to kill each other, but now we have love for one another.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.670
We have forgiven one another.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.670
Jehovah's organization changes their person completely.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:42.670
If I think back to the kind of person I was and what I am now, I never want to be what I was then.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:51.450
Never. Yet it is such a privilege to be a witness.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:58.450
People call me a softie, but I do not mind. I have become a softie, but for Jehovah.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:08.450
I never thought that somebody like Pradachidion, who is coming from the extreme right organization,

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:15.450
can worship with me who is from an extreme left organization.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.450
You can only think of Isaiah where he said.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:28.450
The wolf and the lion will eat this straw, and the boy will play in the hole of a dangerous snake.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:36.450
So the transformation of our personality plate has led us to be genuine brothers.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:46.200
The two brothers, Johnny and Gideon, serve in the same congregation in the Northwest Province of South Africa.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.200
And regularly do public witnessing together.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:59.200
Old colleagues from their past careers in politics regularly come up to Johnny and Gideon to encourage them to pursue politics again.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:07.200
That has given the brothers many good opportunities to witness to them about our loving, non-partial God.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:16.670
Yes, no matter our circumstances, the truth about Jehovah penetrates whatever beliefs we have had in the past.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:19.670
As long as we have an honest heart.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:26.670
That also applies to those who have committed a crime and now have been sentenced to serve time in prison.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:35.670
Did you know that in many countries around the world, special arrangements are being made to preach inside prison walls?

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:43.670
Those involved in prison witnessing meet many individuals that express a thirst for spiritual things.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:49.940
My name is Glen Monroe Hamilton.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.940
I'm in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:31:11.849
I just need help.

00:31:11.849 --> 00:31:20.849
We receive about a thousand requests each month from both men and women that are incarcerated throughout the United States territory.

00:31:20.849 --> 00:31:27.849
We check and see what type of access the congregation might have that visiting that facility.

00:31:27.849 --> 00:31:37.849
So some congregations are able to deliver the literature and then some congregations have one of the best arrangements which is a group Bible study.

00:31:37.849 --> 00:31:42.849
Luke 418 speaks of proclaiming liberty to the captives.

00:31:42.849 --> 00:31:47.849
One way that we're doing that is through the Prison Witnessing Initiative.

00:31:47.849 --> 00:31:57.849
Our Prison Ministry program appeals to prisoners searching for answers if they can't have physical freedom, mental freedom.

00:31:57.849 --> 00:32:01.849
And who's going to give it to them? Where does it come from?

00:32:01.849 --> 00:32:04.849
It comes from outside the prison system.

00:32:04.849 --> 00:32:16.849
Now when you think of two million people in our prison system in the United States, there are several countries that have populations of two million people.

00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:23.849
So in effect, entering the Prison Ministry is entering another country.

00:32:23.849 --> 00:32:36.849
A country where people need relief, they need understanding, they need spiritual strength and education, they need meaning to their lives.

00:32:36.849 --> 00:32:43.849
Think of it as a gated community of two million residents. That's quite a territory.

00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:51.849
Our group is one of Jehovah's Witnesses. Once I became my adolescent, I never wanted anyone telling me what to do.

00:32:51.849 --> 00:32:59.849
I decided I didn't want to serve Jehovah anymore. After I left Jehovah, I didn't have any type of direction.

00:32:59.849 --> 00:33:07.849
I was meeting drug dealers, hustlers, people who were just trying to do anything and everything to get money.

00:33:07.849 --> 00:33:17.849
I was arrested for conspiracy to sell drugs and sentenced to a long term and a federal penitentiary.

00:33:17.849 --> 00:33:28.259
I eventually found the Bible. All I did was read the Bible, read the Bible and read the Bible during that time.

00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:35.259
I was having a change of thinking in mind because I always knew I had to return to Jehovah.

00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:39.259
Jehovah was always here, but it was just so hard to return.

00:33:39.259 --> 00:33:45.259
I started writing a branch, asking for literature to come into the federal penitentiary.

00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:57.259
The day I met brother Shabeta, I was actually praying, supplicating, and I was saying Jehovah, Jehovah, I need to talk to somebody.

00:33:57.259 --> 00:34:01.259
So now I hear knock on my door.

00:34:01.259 --> 00:34:09.260
And I got this man looking at him and I'm looking at him. He opens the door, looks at me. He says,

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:19.050
are you an elder? Yes. And then I'll never forget what he did next.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:28.710
The door was open and he reached out and he touched my arm. He says, what are you, some kind of an angel or something?

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:36.710
I thought maybe it was nuts. An angel. Hey buddy, I'm so far from an angel.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:44.710
It's laughable and he laughs. He says, do you know what I was just doing?

00:34:44.710 --> 00:35:01.289
No. I was on my knees. I was begging God to send somebody. I was ready to crack.

00:35:01.289 --> 00:35:09.289
As members of the prison ministry team, we have three basic things we plan.

00:35:09.289 --> 00:35:13.289
We plan our meetings as they would be in a local kingdom hall.

00:35:13.289 --> 00:35:17.289
And we have the inmates participate in the meetings.

00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:21.289
We have Bible study and one-on-one checkering.

00:35:21.289 --> 00:35:25.289
We also have special events we plan for.

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:29.289
We have the baptism of inmates once they progress to that point.

00:35:29.289 --> 00:35:39.289
We conduct the memorial, passing the emblems just as we would outside and kingdom halls and memorial facilities once a year.

00:35:39.289 --> 00:35:45.289
Something happens to them. The change is them. We teach them and shepherd them.

00:35:45.289 --> 00:35:51.289
They develop a love for God and a love for others.

00:35:51.289 --> 00:35:59.289
It seems uncharacteristic because they come in as messed up felons and they leave as loving people.

00:35:59.289 --> 00:36:07.289
Upon being released from prison, my life is very different.

00:36:07.289 --> 00:36:13.289
Jehovah has just been blessed me by having a wonderful family.

00:36:13.289 --> 00:36:17.289
Jehovah has blessed me with a wonderful, beautiful wife.

00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:23.289
He has also allowed me to reach the goal of becoming a regular pioneer.

00:36:23.289 --> 00:36:29.289
Jehovah has also allowed me to become a ministerial servant.

00:36:29.289 --> 00:36:31.289
It's just too many blessings, too many things to count.

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:37.289
Without the prison ministry, I probably would have never been able to have a...

00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:41.289
to be able to progress virtually.

00:36:41.289 --> 00:36:49.289
The prison ministry helps us to be structured, being taught the same Bible teachings that people who are free have.

00:36:49.289 --> 00:36:53.289
It's just a love and arrangement that's provided by Jehovah.

00:36:53.289 --> 00:36:59.289
That those men in there love and appreciate. I know I do. I appreciate it dearly.

00:36:59.289 --> 00:37:05.289
It's a vast prison population. It is truly right for the harvest.

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:11.289
But if you're genuine in your heart about wanting to know about Jehovah, he's going to take care.

00:37:11.289 --> 00:37:15.289
He's going to watch over you. He's going to give you what you need.

00:37:15.289 --> 00:37:19.289
Whether you're in prison or you're free, he's going to take care of you.

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:30.070
We are so happy to see the results of the efforts put forth by our brothers to reach people of all backgrounds.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:36.070
Indeed, there's a lot of work to be done in making Jehovah's name known.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:44.070
We met a brother in Britain who wanted to expand his ministry and Jehovah blessed his prayers.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:51.909
My name's Jonathan and I've been in Bethel for eight years.

00:37:51.909 --> 00:37:55.909
When I was young and people would ask me what my goals were, I'd always say it was to pioneer.

00:37:55.909 --> 00:37:58.909
I don't think I really knew what my goals were at that time.

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:02.909
It took quite a while for me to find out what I really wanted to do.

00:38:02.909 --> 00:38:08.909
After I finished school, I did a course for two years in business studies and then I did work four times.

00:38:08.909 --> 00:38:15.909
But I think through my associations, I started realizing that really there's more that I could be doing in Jehovah's service.

00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:19.909
Because I wanted to taste what Bethel was like, it made me want to commute.

00:38:19.909 --> 00:38:26.909
You can come as a visitor, you can come as a guest, you can come to see friends that you've got in Bethel.

00:38:26.909 --> 00:38:32.909
But it's not the same as actually being in Bethel and working along with the brothers in the department.

00:38:32.909 --> 00:38:35.909
I really enjoy my assignment at Bethel.

00:38:35.909 --> 00:38:37.909
So I helped to look after the accommodation.

00:38:37.909 --> 00:38:41.909
We get requests from different members of the family to have personal guests.

00:38:41.909 --> 00:38:48.909
We may receive requests from other branches and my job is to try and care for the accommodation needs.

00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:54.909
It's a really great privilege to be able to work along and to help the family and that is what our department does.

00:38:54.909 --> 00:39:00.909
Something that I've always felt was it would have been nicer to come to Bethel earlier.

00:39:00.909 --> 00:39:02.909
I don't know why I waited till I was 23.

00:39:02.909 --> 00:39:07.909
So if anyone else is thinking about what they're going to do, should I try Bethel or just try it?

00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:10.909
Because what you experience at Bethel, you'd not regret.

00:39:10.909 --> 00:39:22.599
We would like to make you aware of a fascinating story that's been posted on the video and demand section of JW Broadcasting.

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:29.599
It's about the dedication of a new assembly hall in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.

00:39:30.599 --> 00:39:39.599
The video highlights how Jehovah's name came to be praised by neighbors and authorities as a result of this new facility.

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:46.599
In Matthew chapter 10, Jesus prophesied about how his disciples would be treated.

00:39:46.599 --> 00:39:48.599
In verse 22 he said,

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:58.599
And you will be hated by all people on account of my name, but the one who has endured to the end will be saved.

00:39:58.599 --> 00:40:05.599
Knowing these scriptures, it comes as no surprise that we meet opposition from time to time.

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:13.599
But as Jesus said, it all takes place on account of his name and by extension, Jehovah's name.

00:40:14.599 --> 00:40:20.599
We are proud to represent the sovereign of the universe and his son, even if we are persecuted.

00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:28.599
Brother Nikolai Nigrich from Russia has experienced persecution firsthand many times.

00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:33.599
In spite of that, he has maintained his joy in his service to Jehovah.

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:48.039
My mother came very close to never seeing me again.

00:40:48.039 --> 00:41:14.619
I asked her to tell me what happened.

00:41:14.619 --> 00:41:21.619
She told me that in April of 1952, she had been sent to a labor camp.

00:41:21.619 --> 00:41:26.619
She got ten years for refusing to betray the brothers taking the lead.

00:41:26.619 --> 00:41:35.059
It was a big thing back then that a pregnant woman was given such a long sentence.

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:46.039
I was born in the labor camp on August 6, 1952.

00:41:46.039 --> 00:41:53.150
As my mother told me, one winter I became critical at El.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:59.159
I had tuberculosis of the bone.

00:41:59.159 --> 00:42:06.159
The doctors didn't think I could recover, so they called my father to come and take me away.

00:42:06.159 --> 00:42:10.159
I was only a year and a half old.

00:42:10.159 --> 00:42:16.159
My father picked me up and carried me to the village where he lived.

00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:21.159
He showed me to some doctors and they were horrified at my condition.

00:42:21.159 --> 00:42:26.159
They were afraid to take responsibility for me.

00:42:26.159 --> 00:42:33.159
My father said that one of the doctors there, a woman, felt compassion for me

00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:36.159
and said she would take on my case.

00:42:36.159 --> 00:42:42.159
The treatment she prescribed was very painful, but it worked.

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:49.610
I did recover from the disease.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:54.610
One sunny day we were at home in our house in the village.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:57.610
My grandmother was there and my father.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:08.139
I looked and the woman came in the house and stood in the door.

00:43:08.139 --> 00:43:12.139
And someone, either my father, for my grandmother said,

00:43:12.139 --> 00:43:21.949
that's your mother, then I looked at her again more closely.

00:43:21.949 --> 00:43:28.739
She was wearing a striped dress.

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:33.739
Later I realized that I had been wearing the same striped clothes

00:43:33.739 --> 00:43:42.559
when my father came to the prison to get me.

00:43:42.559 --> 00:43:47.559
She took out a toy car, green, made of metal.

00:43:47.559 --> 00:43:51.559
She pushed it and it clotted out to my feet and stopped.

00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:59.559
It was the first time that I really understood that I had a mother.

00:43:59.559 --> 00:44:03.559
She had come and she was right here.

00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:11.360
I felt very good.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:17.360
I ran out to the field in front of our house and shouted to our neighbors.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.360
Mama has come. Mama has come.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.360
This was the first really happy event in my life that I remember,

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.360
that I met my mother.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:32.760
I get excited just remembering it.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.760
How it all happened.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:44.889
But my mother and I came very close to never seeing each other again.

00:44:44.889 --> 00:44:49.889
She said that all the women in the labor camp worked in the forest.

00:44:49.889 --> 00:44:52.889
The snow was waist high.

00:44:52.889 --> 00:44:54.889
It was very cold.

00:44:54.889 --> 00:44:56.889
They were cutting down trees.

00:44:56.889 --> 00:45:07.519
On one occasion, they were being led back to the camp from the forest.

00:45:07.519 --> 00:45:15.940
My mother's sled got stuck on a tree stump.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.940
The horse could not pull it free.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.940
The guards somehow didn't notice.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.940
Then they realized that a horse and a prisoner were missing.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:41.739
One of the soldiers ran towards my mother with a rifle.

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:44.739
He was already cocking it.

00:45:44.739 --> 00:45:48.739
My mother told me later that she was terrified.

00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:51.739
She thought that her life was over.

00:45:51.739 --> 00:45:55.739
But the other soldiers stopped him and said, it's not her fault.

00:45:55.739 --> 00:46:04.230
She got stuck.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:15.900
That story I will always remember.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.900
I grew up partly without a mother because she was imprisoned.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:28.179
Then it turned out that my son grew up without a father because I was imprisoned.

00:46:28.179 --> 00:46:39.280
I was also imprisoned for my faith.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.280
When I was sent to prison, my wife was pregnant.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:49.280
I didn't see my son until a few months after he was born.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.559
The first time she brought him, he was tiny.

00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:59.559
She was during the winter and it was very cold.

00:46:59.559 --> 00:47:02.559
She brought him to the prison to see me.

00:47:02.559 --> 00:47:10.250
She wrapped him in blankets and there he was, wiggling.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:14.250
She showed him to me, saying, here is your son.

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:20.250
I felt very tense and trapped because the prison woman was standing right behind me.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:26.940
But I also felt very happy to have a real family.

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.940
It was very hard to leave them.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:42.059
I wanted to hold my son but they didn't let me.

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:50.059
The god whom we serve, Jehovah, acted in our hearts and minds with his holy spirit.

00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:56.059
So these trials did not affect us in the way they affected other people.

00:47:56.059 --> 00:48:00.059
We were optimistic about the future.

00:48:00.059 --> 00:48:05.059
We were confident that God would not leave his servants.

00:48:05.059 --> 00:48:11.059
That's all of this in my own case.

00:48:11.059 --> 00:48:21.090
Now I can look back with a smile while remembering everything I lived through.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:25.090
What an example for all of us to imitate.

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:30.090
When my wife and I visit different branches on various speaking assignments,

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:38.090
what encourages us the most is seeing how our brothers and sisters worldwide remain loyal to Jehovah.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:45.090
Brother Mark Numer and his wife went on such a trip recently and came back with many fine experiences.

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:53.090
You probably remember Brother Numer as the co-anchor in the December 2014 monthly program.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:49:00.090
As a headquarters representative, Brother Numer had the privilege of visiting three branches in Africa.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:19.420
Recently, Sister Numer and I had the privilege of joining Brother and Sister Maray in visiting three countries in East Africa.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:28.420
Our first stop was Tanzania, where we visited the remote translation office which is located in Dar Salam.

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:36.420
There are 41 devoted brothers and sisters working at this office assisting with Swahili translation.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:45.500
We also had the opportunity to join the brothers and the ministry and to witness firsthand their zeal for the truth.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.500
Many recall Clinton, Wendy, Winkleman.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:54.500
They served at Patterson before being assigned to Tanzania as Besselites in Foreign Service.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:59.500
Here you'll notice Wendy is conducting a Bible study with a woman on the right.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:04.500
But woman on the left is also her Bible student that came early in his waiting her turn.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:10.550
The people in Tanzania are hungry for the truth.

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:15.900
The metropolitan witnessing is now being done in Dar Salam.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:22.900
Since it began nine months ago, over 150,000 pieces of literature have been taken.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:30.900
Hundreds of requests for Bible studies have been made and several people have begun attending meetings and are making spiritual progress.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:39.179
In the village areas of Tanzania, people are also receiving a witness, but from their mobile devices.

00:50:39.179 --> 00:50:47.179
They are able to get in contact with their students, direct them to the website, and show them videos.

00:50:47.179 --> 00:51:03.530
During our visit, the brothers arranged for a special meeting connecting 19 other locations and they had a combined attendance of over 18,500.

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:06.530
This is Tanzania's Broadcasting Department.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:15.530
They utilized a simple router to connect all 18,000 friends, and if that for some reason didn't connect, they had a B plan.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:22.530
Each location had its own designated cell phone, and the brothers on standby ready to connect each one.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:28.530
Thanks to these young brothers, we had smooth connections the entire program.

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:38.570
On to our next stop, Kenya. For Paddy and I, it was like coming home.

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:46.139
30 years later, some things still haven't changed. Paddy's still making great coffee.

00:51:46.139 --> 00:51:54.139
When we arrived as missionaries, Kenya had about 3,000 publishers. Now they have over 27,000.

00:51:54.139 --> 00:51:58.139
Shell is one of the many young ones we met when we were in the circuit work.

00:51:58.139 --> 00:52:02.139
Now, he is serving as a translator in the RTO.

00:52:02.139 --> 00:52:07.139
This family adopted us when we were new missionaries and helped us learn Swahili.

00:52:07.139 --> 00:52:12.139
The little girl on the bike is now serving at Bethel along with her husband.

00:52:12.139 --> 00:52:20.059
We were so happy to see many of these young ones grow up into spiritual men and women.

00:52:20.059 --> 00:52:28.059
The parents of these ones really took to heart the importance of training their children, and we can see the good results that came from it.

00:52:28.059 --> 00:55:36.099
The total attendance for the special program in Kenya was over 35,000.

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:41.099
And it was streamed to 25 locations, including Sudan.

00:55:41.099 --> 00:55:50.059
On to our next stop, Malawi. The branch office is located in Le Longway.

00:55:50.059 --> 00:56:02.289
The attendance for the special meeting was 43,479 from seven different locations.

00:56:03.289 --> 00:56:13.710
Not long ago, our Bethel family listened to a branch report from Malawi about unity players.

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:18.710
They have a battery that can be charged by a solar panel or a hand crank.

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:23.710
Traveling overseers download new songs and videos onto a memory stick.

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:30.710
From there, they connect the memory stick to the unity player, which acts as a sound system for playing the new songs.

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:38.269
The player also has a microphone, which helps when they are teaching the congregation.

00:56:38.269 --> 00:56:46.269
When they want to show one of our videos with the projector, they connect the memory stick in the projector and the unity player for sound.

00:56:46.269 --> 00:56:57.269
This wonderful provision from Jehovah's Organization has helped so many of our dear brothers and sisters to really benefit even in remote areas.

00:56:57.269 --> 00:57:03.940
They get to know more of their international brotherhood and the governing body.

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:10.940
The brothers are keen on helping as many as possible to obtain and practice the new songs.

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:14.940
The brothers take out their cell phones and turn on the Bluetooth setting.

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:19.940
They share the music via Bluetooth from one brother's phone to another brother's phone.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:25.940
In just a short time, the whole congregation has the new music on their phones.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:34.230
They just can't wait to get home and start learning and singing the new songs.

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:39.230
A portion of our visit was spent strengthening and encouraging translation teams.

00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:45.230
Brother Morey was particularly pleased to speak with all four of the remote translation offices.

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:52.230
Even though the internet is limited, people are still benefiting from JW.org in Malawi.

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:58.230
The brothers have traveled out to Nomueda to do recordings for the Yao language.

00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:09.849
While the RTO is under construction, the audio video department will set up a mobile studio in the local kingdom hall.

00:58:09.849 --> 00:58:21.250
Yao is mainly a spoken language, so the brothers download recordings or videos on a memory stick and take it in the field service.

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:28.250
So the brothers play the audio publication for the householder on their own radio while they follow along in the printed publication.

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:43.139
A big lesson we learned during our visit is that it's not about technology, it's not about possessions, it's all about people.

00:58:43.139 --> 00:58:47.139
And they're willing spirit that is getting the work done.

00:58:47.139 --> 00:58:51.139
And there is so much work yet to do in the lands we visited.

00:58:51.139 --> 00:59:00.139
It is our prayer that the sharp sickle in the hand of Christ continue to reap the people of Tanzania, Kenya and Malawi.

00:59:00.139 --> 01:00:01.420
Are truly a worldwide united brotherhood, don't you agree?

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:13.420
On this month's program alone, we've seen reports from our dear brothers and sisters in South Africa, the United States, Britain, Tanzania, Malawi and Kenya.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:16.420
We will now take you to Myanmar.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:26.420
The brothers there have put together a music video that highlights how young ones in any culture can prove that they want to be part of Jehovah's name people.

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:37.420
We assure that you'll not only enjoy the music, but we'll also appreciate seeing how our brothers in Myanmar dress and the type of makeup that our sisters use.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:48.420
If you want to learn more about this fascinating culture, please refer to the explanation that is found in our 2013 yearbook on page 99.

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:55.420
But for now, let's enjoy listening to this song that is entitled Give You My All.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:11.860
The choice is that I could make so many pathways that I could take.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:21.829
I know that someday I'll make my vow is now in blessing.

01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:29.219
We'll take their steps.

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:35.219
This isn't something somebody chose for me. It's something I want to do.

01:01:35.219 --> 01:03:17.139
I want to stand up on my two feet, answer the call us for fun, my best while I'm still young, decide with you and your son my two feet.

01:03:17.139 --> 01:03:31.139
Jehovah has taken out from the nations of people for his name, and we are proud to be the ones who bear his name today as Jehovah's Witnesses, just like the many examples we've seen on this month's program.

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:41.139
We want to be used by Jehovah in teaching people the divine name of our Heavenly Father, despite our circumstances or background.

01:03:41.139 --> 01:03:52.139
To conclude the program, we have greetings from our brothers and sisters in Israel, namely from the Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv Hebrew congregations.

01:03:52.139 --> 01:03:58.139
There is a great need in Israel since most of the territory has yet to be covered.

01:03:58.139 --> 01:04:06.139
The congregation in Jerusalem is made up of 40 publishers and they have a large territory to cover.

01:04:06.139 --> 01:04:12.139
The ratio is one publisher to almost 27,000 people.

01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:17.139
A Russian group is also associated with the Hebrew congregation.

01:04:17.139 --> 01:04:24.139
We commend our brothers and sisters in Jerusalem for their hard work in making Jehovah's name known.

01:04:24.139 --> 01:04:34.139
The Tel Aviv Hebrew congregation has a total of almost 80 publishers and the ratio is one publisher to 10,000 people.

01:04:34.139 --> 01:04:41.139
We were happy to see these images of a family and a grandmother enjoying their family worship evening.

01:04:41.139 --> 01:04:46.139
This time they're making a puzzle and reading the Bible together.

01:04:47.139 --> 01:04:57.139
Also in Tel Aviv, this is a group of brothers and sisters that came together to watch the monthly program of JW Broadcasting.

01:04:57.139 --> 01:05:09.139
In July last year the special metropolitan public witnessing program started in Tel Aviv, which is resulted in considerable interest from the local people.

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:19.139
For many Israelis this has been the first time that they have heard about a day Yovar as Jehovah's Witnesses are called in Hebrew.

01:05:19.139 --> 01:05:27.139
Thank you for joining us this month. This is JW Broadcasting from Brooklyn, New York.
