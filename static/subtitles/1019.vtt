00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.059
Brothers, it's hard to believe this is our last time together.

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:09.060
Wow, we have the pack agenda.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.060
So let's get started.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.060
This is our last week with our circuit overseer

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.059
before he leaves us for his new circuit assignment.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.059
Rick's been a great circuit overseer,

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:24.059
spiritually mature, experienced, and patient,

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:25.059
with us.

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.059
Tom, you thought?

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.060
Rick is single, and sadly, there were plenty times

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.060
we turned that gift into a challenge.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.060
Ever since his first visit.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:55.140
A minute?

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.140
Oh, that.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.140
Longing night.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.140
My washing machine is a clanker.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.140
I just assumed a single brother had lots of free time.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.140
I didn't know how much he had to do on his own.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.140
But there was a lot more.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.140
I didn't understand.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.420
Thank you.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420
Bye-bye.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.370
Hey.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.370
Look.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.370
They have something there.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.370
It sounds like a great Bible study.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.370
I can't wait to meet her.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.370
Thank you. See you then.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.370
See ya.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.900
That would be really good.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.900
I don't know what you're waiting for.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900
For what?

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.900
Come on.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.900
A single circuit overseer, a pioneer sister.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.900
You've got to be looking for a CEO wife.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.620
Well, the teasing was so inappropriate.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.620
And was there at every visit.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.689
Then there were those trying to be, how should I say,

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.219
helpful?

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:12.219
Look.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.219
You want to meet them.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.219
And so I invite them for lunch Saturday.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.219
Rick never asked for that help.

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.219
All it did was put him and plenty of sisters

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.219
in an awkward situation.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:32.500
That's what he dealt with week after week.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
We all failed at times to see past the single person

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.500
to the spiritual man giving Jehovah his best.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500
We'll miss you.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Just maybe not as much as some of the sisters.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
I didn't want to make that mistake again

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.500
with any single brother or sister.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
Rick, Jeff, thank you.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
I learn a lot from you.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.500
And I hope Jehovah blesses you wherever you go.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500
Thanks, Rayman.
