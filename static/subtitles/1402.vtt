00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.039
Yo, so tell me

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:25.760
Hi again

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.760
You're really quite stealthy

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.039
Really, I'm right perfect when I'm late for class

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.759
Which is always right?

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:40.479
So last week you spoke about promises and

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:45.840
I'm not about church, but I am about promises

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.240
So okay, well

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.920
If these are God's promises, wouldn't it make sense to go to his word to find out how to enjoy them seems right?

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.320
Okay, this is John 173

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.950
Would you like to read it?

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.310
Out loud

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.829
Really?

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.950
Then you know what it says I do, but it's nice to hear it again

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.109
This means everlasting life

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.310
They're coming to know you the only true God

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.430
And the one who you sent Jesus Christ

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.750
So based on this, what means everlasting life?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.459
Getting to know God, but how can you get to know something? You're not even sure exists

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.819
Would you like to explore that answer next time you come by?

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.099
Who said anything about next time?

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.739
Oh, I'm just one of you up

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.739
See you later
