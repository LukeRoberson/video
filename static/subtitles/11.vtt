00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:09.460
Thank you for joining us. We have an exciting news event that we wanted you to hear first on the JW Broadcasting Television Station.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:37.950
Our report comes to us from Turkmenistan, and presently our brothers and sisters endeavored to carry on their ministry in the same way that Jehovah's Witnesses do around the globe.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.950
But what unique circumstances have some of them faced in past years?

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.950
And recently, what fair and reasonable action did the President of that country take in behalf of human rights?

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:59.950
To begin this story, we have with us, Brother Shane Brady, who is also a human rights lawyer and familiar with this significant account in Turkmenistan.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:08.900
October 22, 2014 was a historic and happy day for Jehovah's Witnesses in Turkmenistan.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.900
Eight of our brothers were released from prison based on a presidential animosity.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.900
All of the brothers had been in prison because their Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.900
Some of the brothers had already been in prison for several years when they were released from prison.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.900
Two of the brothers were serving their second term of imprisonment.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.900
Turkmenistan is located on the east coast of the Caspian Sea.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:40.900
During the past two decades, dozens of our brothers have been sent to prison because they would not accept compulsory military service.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.900
The Bible contains many principles based on which I decided not to perform military service.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:59.900
One of these principles is found in Isaiah chapter 2 verse 4, where it says that God's people will not go to war and not even learn war.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:09.900
As a Christian, I understood that not only should I not go to war, but I should not even learn to hurt people.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.900
I knew from the Bible what Jesus said in Matthew 2652, or it says,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.900
return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.900
From this scripture I understood that Jesus and Jehovah do not like wars.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.900
Therefore, I refused.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.900
At first, I was sentenced to a year and a half in a general security prison.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.900
The second time, I was sentenced to two years in a high security prison.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.900
Several were imprisoned based on fabricated charges.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.900
Ibic Salaya was convicted on false charges in April 2012, and he was sentenced to four years in prison.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.900
I was falsely accused of committing a crime that I didn't commit.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.900
But the reason for that is that I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:15.900
On August 18, 2014, B.B. Ramoneva, a married mother of a little four-year-old boy, was convicted on false charges.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.900
The court sentenced her to four years in prison.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.900
Thankfully, on September 2, 2014, the appeal court ordered her to be released immediately from prison.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.900
I was imprisoned on a false charge for something I didn't do.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.900
Prison conditions were very difficult for our brothers,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.900
but their strong faith helped them to endure.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:48.900
The reason why it was hard for me to be imprisoned is that I have a family, a husband, and a little child.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.900
So it was hard for me to be separated from them.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.900
There was so much distance between us.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.900
I have never been separated from them before.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:13.900
That's why it was so hard for me to be imprisoned.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.899
What helped me spiritually to stay firm in the faith was prayer to Jehovah.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:25.899
I intensely prayed to Jehovah and felt that he was near.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:31.899
Also, I shared what I knew with those around me.

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:37.899
The Bible verse I always reflected on is the verse where Jesus says,

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:42.899
the one who has endured to the end will be saved.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:45.899
I always thought, I've taken the first step.

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:48.899
I'm already imprisoned for refusing military service,

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:52.899
but I understood that I must endure to the end.

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:56.899
That is, not just be sent to prison for the sake of the truth,

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:59.899
but come out with my integrity intact.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:04.899
And this verse always helped me.

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.899
What helped me to keep a positive attitude was the example from the Bible of Daniel.

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:15.899
I know that an order was put forth, and after this, he continued praying three times a day.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.899
I liked his attitude, and I did the same thing. I prayed three times a day.

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.899
And this helped me. And even after praying, I would sing songs.

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:28.899
For example, number two. Thank you, Jehovah.

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:32.899
And the second song was number seven, the dedication to Jehovah.

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:36.899
And the second thing that helped me was that I knew and was confident

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:41.899
that everyone was praying for me, the worldwide Brotherhood.

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:47.899
Imagine how happy the brothers were when they were finally released.

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:53.899
I'm extremely happy that I'm released and reunited with my family.

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.899
Above all, I want to thank Jehovah.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.899
He really protected and supported me.

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:06.899
Whatever difficulty I had, he always was close to me.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:14.540
I am thankful that I am with my family now, and can share my joy with them.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.540
I am very happy.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:25.540
When I came home and stepped through the doorway, I could hardly imagine how my son would react.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:32.540
When he saw me, he threw his arms around my neck and hugged me, saying,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:40.540
Mommy, I was overjoyed to see him so happy.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:53.949
We hugged each other and cried.

00:06:53.949 --> 00:07:04.410
My son told me, Mommy, don't ever leave me again.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.410
I am so thankful to Jehovah that he reunited us.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.410
He supported me so much in my trials and protected me.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.410
I am happy to have found Jehovah.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.410
It is an indescribable feeling when you are freed.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:33.410
When someone is sent to prison, everyone gets that feeling like they will never get out of there.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:41.410
So, when they freed us, it was such an incredible miracle.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.410
All of us, we had such joy.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.410
Until we got home, we couldn't believe we were free.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:54.410
We thank the President of Turkmenistan for releasing Jehovah's Witnesses from prison.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:08:00.410
Our brothers in Turkmenistan want to have a good relationship with the authorities.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:06.410
They strive to be modal citizens and they respect the authority of the state.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.410
We hope that these positive developments will continue and that the government of Turkmenistan

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:18.410
will allow Jehovah's Witnesses to worship peacefully their God according to their conscience.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.410
To be a Christian means to live by Bible principles.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:30.410
One of these principles is in 1 Timothy, chapter 2 verses 1 and 2, where it says,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:40.409
First of all, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgiving be made concerning all sorts of men,

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:47.409
concerning kings and all those who are in high positions so that we may go on leading a common quiet life

00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:50.409
with complete godly devotion and seriousness.

00:08:50.409 --> 00:08:59.409
I am very grateful to the authorities that they didn't let me serve my whole prison sentence but released me.

00:08:59.409 --> 00:09:04.409
They gave me the opportunity to see my relatives and close friends.

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:08.409
I am very grateful to them.

00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:16.409
My attitude toward the government has not changed since I always try to view them as Jehovah asks.

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:21.409
According to the principle in Romans, respect the superior authorities

00:09:21.409 --> 00:09:26.409
because it says there that there is no authority except by God

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:31.409
and I always try to show them respect.

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:40.409
Also, I am grateful to them that we have and I have the possibility to rejoin my family.

00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:47.409
My attitude toward the authorities has not changed at all

00:09:47.409 --> 00:09:51.409
because the whole scripture teaches to respect the authorities.

00:09:51.409 --> 00:09:58.409
I still have that same view now and do not feel any hatred toward them.

00:09:58.409 --> 00:10:03.409
I am also thankful to them that they reunited my family

00:10:03.409 --> 00:10:11.200
and did not leave me in prison for four years, but released me.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.200
This is a significant moment in history for our fellow witnesses in Turkmenistan

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:22.200
and we are happy that our brothers involved are again united with their families in congregation.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.200
As you know, there have been numerous legal cases in countries around the world

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.200
where the courts have ruled in favor of Jehovah's Witnesses right to freedom of worship.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.200
Cases have also been filed to the international courts concerning the imprisonment of our brothers in Turkmenistan.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.200
However, rather than waiting for those cases to be decided,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.200
the president and current government officials in Turkmenistan took it upon themselves

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.200
to grant this amnesty in the interest of human rights and fairness.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:59.200
We commend them and thank them for having the insight and courage to make such a significant decision

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.200
and we pray for them and for our brothers and sisters in that country.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.200
Thank you again for joining us.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.200
This is JW Broadcasting and Brooklyn, New York.
