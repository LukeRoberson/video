00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.869
With one act of defiance, mankind became lost.

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:20.239
Alienated from the life that belongs to God,

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:26.940
sin and death have become inescapable for every human born on earth,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:36.780
with the exception of one, Jesus Christ.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.280
He used his God-given powers to heal sicknesses.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.280
Feed thousands.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.780
He even resurrected people back to life.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.780
Jesus performed many miracles while on earth.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.280
But are they simply a collection of stories from the past

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.099
or clues to something far grander?

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:21.489
A glimpse into a wondrous future?

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:30.769
A future where God will satisfy the desire of every living thing.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:32.769
The real life.

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:37.269
But God promises to each of his faithful servants.

00:01:37.269 --> 00:02:30.750
How can this beautiful future be possible?

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.539
Because of what Jesus did for us?

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:48.280
He came to earth for a purpose.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:03:17.490
He gave his life for those he loved.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:04:00.039
The curse of inherited sin and death could now be lifted from each one of us.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:05.039
If we look intently to Jesus, we will no longer be lost.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:12.039
He will show us the way to the Father.
