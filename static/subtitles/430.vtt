00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.750
Sometimes, I think all of us would agree that it's easy to see Jehovah's hand when things are going well,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.750
when we get a court victory, when someone's health improves,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.750
or maybe when someone really asks to come to study the Bible with us and they're at our meetings.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.750
But it's harder to see Jehovah's hand when we see bad things happen, either to us or our brothers and sisters.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.750
So we may wonder, how can we see Jehovah's hand when bad things are happening?

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.750
Well, you can see my hand right now, right?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.750
But if I put it away, you can't see it.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.750
Now, do you assume because you can't see my hand that I don't have a hand anymore?

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.750
Well, no, you reasoned on the fact that you see the rest of me and there's probably still my hand attached.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.750
So likewise, there are times when it's easy to see Jehovah's hand,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.750
and there are other times when we have to reason on what we know about Jehovah in order to see his hand in action.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.750
So let's consider one thing.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.750
What do we know about Jehovah that we could reason that his hand is in action?

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.750
Well, let's reason on the point that he is a happy God.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.750
Now, how does Jehovah stay happy seeing all the bad things that are happening?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.750
Maybe you've wondered that.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.750
I know it's crossed my mind, how does Jehovah stay happy when he sees all the suffering that's going on?

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.750
And frankly, he sees all the suffering. He sees everything going on.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.750
I know how I feel, and you probably know how you feel, just when you read about what's happening to our brothers in Venezuela,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.750
or in Russia, or with all of the hurricanes and earthquakes that we've had in recent times,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.750
and we see the suffering, not only of our brothers and sisters, but of other people,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.750
and we consider how can Jehovah stay happy when he knows all of what is happening?

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.750
Well, let's consider three. I'm sure of many reasons why Jehovah can stay happy,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.750
even though he knows all the suffering, and then we can see how that could benefit us as well.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.750
First of all, his hand is hard at work preparing the new world for us.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:27.750
And I think Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 really covers how Jehovah feels about the future for us.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.750
Jeremiah 29-11, he says, where I will know the thoughts that I am thinking towards you declares Jehovah,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.750
thoughts of peace and not of calamity, to give you a future and a hope.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.750
So Jehovah is not simply just watching events occur. He's actively working on the solution.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.750
He, along with Jesus and the heavenly angels, are working hard on the kingdom.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.750
Now, we can't see end of heaven right now, but I want you to just imagine all the activity of the angels,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.750
the resurrected andointed brothers, Jesus, working hard on making preparations

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.750
for Armageddon and the new world. Just think of all the work we're doing just to prepare for the annual meeting and dedication.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.750
Can you imagine all the work going on in heaven that is there? I mean, how far along are the new scrolls?

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.750
How are basic needs as far as clean water, food, and homes going to be provided for the survivors?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.750
So, while we can't see into heaven, we know that his hand is there.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.750
So Jehovah is happy because he's actively working right now to make things better for us.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.750
What lesson for us? We can be happy when we see the suffering around us,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.750
because we know what Jehovah and our brothers are doing up there to prepare for the new world.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.750
A second point about how Jehovah can be happy is that he can comfort us right now. He is happy when he can do that.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.750
In verse 12 of Jeremiah chapter 29,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.750
Jehovah continued after saying that he was working on the future,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.750
he says, and you will call me and come and pray to me and I will listen to you.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.750
So, I love this point because Jehovah is saying, don't worry, I'm taking care of building a better future for you.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.750
And we appreciate it. If we're going through some trial, some very difficulty,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.750
and a good friend of ours reminds us, remember, things are going to get better in the future.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.750
Jehovah is going to change this. It's going to get better. It is comforting.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.750
But it is also comforting, like Jehovah does here in verse 12, when the person says,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.750
what can I do for you right now? And Jehovah is saying, right now, come, pray to me.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.750
Jehovah is there to comfort and help us.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.750
We could kind of illustrate the way Jehovah feels by thinking about parents

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.750
and how they deal with a small child.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.750
You've ever seen a small child, maybe two, three years of age,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.750
and they really fall badly and scrape their knees badly.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.750
And they are screaming in pain. There's this red liquid leaking out of them.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.750
They are distraught. In fact, in that child's mind,

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.750
he may think, this is the end of it. This is end of life as I know it.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.750
I'm never going to recover from this. I'm going to die.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.750
But the parent, of course, their perspective is different, isn't it?

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.750
But they comfort the child. They help to take care of the skinny, they comfort them,

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.750
and they tell them, you're going to live. It's going to be okay.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.750
It's going to be all right. And why can the parent have that view?

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.750
Because they know in a few hours, maybe, at least in a week or so,

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.750
child's not even going to remember that skinny. It's going to be just a very distant memory.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.750
Well, see, Jehovah also knows that whatever we're going through right now,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.750
whatever suffering we may be going through now, that soon in that new world,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.750
we aren't going to recall that suffering.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.750
And he knows that he can solve any problem we're facing as easily as we heal from a scraped knee.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.750
He knows our whole eternal lives are ahead of us.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.750
So he comforts us, he listens to our heartfelt prayers,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.750
and like a kind parent, he's telling us through our brothers, the Bible,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.750
and Holy Spirit, you will live.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.750
See, Jehovah's happy because right now, what can he do? He can comfort us and help us.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.750
Well, the lesson for us, we can comfort and help others.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.750
We're really kind of all in this lifeboat together,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.750
trying to make it to the new world shore, and we can help one another.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.350
Third, his hand is patiently waiting for the right time to act.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:52.350
See, Jehovah is waiting patiently for the complete vindication of his sovereignty.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.350
I really love what the June 2017 Watchtower article,

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.350
keep your eyes on the big issue, said,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:05.350
let us not become so absorbed in our own lives that we lose sight of the big issue,

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.350
the vindication of Jehovah's sovereignty,

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.350
and let us appreciate that our role in this vital issue entails remaining faithful,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.350
even under difficult circumstances.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.350
Isn't that a beautiful quote to think about?

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.350
See, Jehovah knows that by his being patient now,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.350
he and all his faithful servants will never have to go through this again.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.350
The issue of sovereignty will be completely settled.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.350
I mean, don't you admire Jehovah's patience?

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.350
I mean, to watch all that is happening,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:46.350
and to have the self-control to wait for the appointed time is truly an example of patience in action.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.350
You know, when we think about the different situations,

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.350
our brothers and sisters in other's face,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:57.350
when a mother, for example, watches a handicapped son struggle to walk or to talk,

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.350
or a husband watches his wife struggle to breathe,

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:09.350
you know, we want so much at that moment to press that big red start the new world button now.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.350
But when you have that feeling, remember our text for today,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:21.350
the hand of Jehovah will become known to his servants.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.350
What lesson for us?

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:30.350
We need to be patient and keep our eyes on the big issue of Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.350
So let's just review those three points.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:40.350
How can we see Jehovah's hand and be happy when we see all of this suffering around us?

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.350
Well, we can be happy knowing what Jehovah and Jesus

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.350
and the resurrected andointed are doing right now to prepare for the new world.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:54.350
And we can be happy because we have a role in comforting and helping others.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:59.350
And we can be happy being patient knowing why we're being patient.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:05.350
We have our eyes on that big issue of Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.350
See, we may not always be able to see Jehovah's hand,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.350
but we can be sure, as our text for today says,

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:18.350
that Jehovah's hand is there and it will become known.
