00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.710
We feel blessed to be part of a brotherhood that imitates our generous God, Jehovah.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:22.710
Year after year, you diligently give of your time, energy, and financial resources to support one another both locally and globally.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.710
The governing body has asked me to convey their sincere appreciation for all that you do.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.710
They feel as did the Apostle Paul when he wrote a second Thessalonians chapter 1, verse 3.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.710
We are obligated always to give thanks to God for you brothers, because your faith is growing exceedingly,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.710
and the love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one another.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:00.710
Although the 2021 service year had its challenges, none of the disasters threatened the bond of faith and love we all share.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.709
Your generous donations have played a part in strengthening that bond.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:13.709
The article series, How Your Donations Are Used, has highlighted tangible ways your donations continue to support our brotherhood.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:15.709
Note just a few.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:25.709
Funds are being used to provide JW boxes in many kingdom halls where internet access is limited, helping hundreds of thousands to access spiritual food.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:36.709
With the support of your donations, we have obtained legal victories, allowing many of our brothers who are part of indigenous communities in Latin America to worship freely.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:44.709
And many of us have benefited from the increased use of video streaming and conferencing for our meetings and conventions.

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:51.709
We want to thank you all personally for what you've done to support these initiatives.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:58.709
We especially appreciate that we have the resources available to help our brothers win disaster strikes.

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:04.709
During the COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of thousands have received relief aid.

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:11.710
To date, more than $25 million has been approved to be spent on this relief.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.710
What have been the results?

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.710
From two children, Hortresh and Yadidia in Central Africa ages 9 and 5.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.710
Dear brothers and sisters from Bethel, I thank you.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.710
Thanks to Jehovah, to the branch and to all who distributed food during the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.710
What you did is an expression of the loyal love mentioned in Lamentations chapter 3 verse 22.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:50.710
It is because of Jehovah's loyal love that we have not come to our finish for his mercies never end.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:03:03.710
My sister Yadidia and I thank you very much and encourage you to keep working in any service you are assigned such as translation, the laundry, the kitchen, and so forth.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.710
Thanks a lot.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.710
In Southern Africa, a congregation wrote the brand saying,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.710
it is with great pleasure that we are writing you.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.710
We want to express our appreciation for your support and the help that we received in December of 2020.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.710
It is challenging for us to make ends meet.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.710
We are struggling daily because of the high cost of living.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.710
But despite these hardships, the brothers in our congregation deeply filled Jehovah's love.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.710
We thank you for the relief supply of food and clean drinking water received.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:48.710
Our source of happiness is knowing that we are not alone because we have Jehovah and the worldwide brotherhood on our side.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.710
We are so grateful for your support.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.710
Oh, evident, your donations to the worldwide work by whatever means.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.710
Help provide this needed support.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.710
What can we expect for the 2022 service year?

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.710
We expect the number and the intensity of disasters to increase as we move deeper into the final part of these last days.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.709
But we see many positive developments on the horizon as well.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.709
Under the direction of the governing body, we have been working hard on the Ramippo construction project,

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:28.709
which will be a site primarily dedicated to media production.

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:36.709
You may remember at the 2019 annual meeting, it was announced that site work would begin on this project in 2022.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:42.709
We are happy to report that work on this site is well underway.

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:47.709
This will include completing an existing stone bridge, building new roads,

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:54.709
removing trees, digging and laying sanitary sewer lines, building retaining walls,

00:04:54.709 --> 00:05:00.709
as well as the blasting and moving of over 1 million cubic meters of rock.

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:07.709
Additionally, a new entrance will be constructed along with widening the highway for safer traffic flow near the site.

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:13.709
And towards the end of the year, foundations for the residents buildings will begin.

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:21.709
We eagerly look forward to hearing good reports on this project as it continues to develop.

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:29.709
Like the Christians in Thessalonica, many of you support Kingdom interest financially while enduring your own challenges.

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:40.709
Paul commended the congregation in Thessalonica, and we commend you too, with his inspired words of 2nd Thessalonians chapter 1, verse 4.

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:50.250
We ourselves take pride in you, among the congregations of God, because of your endurance and faith,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.250
in all your persecutions and the hardships that you are suffering.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:04.250
We take pride in your loving work, your acts of faith, and your financial support.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.250
Thank you for all you've done.
