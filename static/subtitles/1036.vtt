00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.740
Have you ever received an email from a non-known source informing you of great news?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.300
You're a grand prize winner

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.179
Just click on the link to receive your prize

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.579
Or maybe it was a phone call

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:22.420
The person says they have exciting news. You've just won something of value, but hurry limited time only

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.179
All you have to do is provide

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.579
your personal information

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.429
Sadly, the great and exciting news usually doesn't turn out as present. It doesn't

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.310
This highlights that no matter the form or method that we receive it

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.869
Much of the news and information we're given today misleads

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:50.429
misinforms and often leaves us disappointed

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.109
Our world is just saturated with bad news

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.350
Even just watching the local news can leave us feeling anxious depressed even fearful

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.230
So it's no wonder that when people actually do receive good news

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.069
They're often skeptical

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.390
Feeling that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.629
The Bible tells us it's actually wise to be cautious about the news we believe

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.150
But it also tells us that there is news

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.430
Good news that we can trust

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.030
I invite you to start with me pleasing your Bibles to the book of Mark

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.430
And in Mark chapter one

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.430
Note the words of Mark chapter one

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.030
verses 14 and 15

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.549
It reads

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.989
Now after John was arrested Jesus went into Galilee

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.590
preaching the good news of God and saying

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.549
The appointed time has been fulfilled and the kingdom of God is drawn near

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590
repent and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.150
Have faith in the good news

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310
Have faith in the good news

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.830
This is the theme of our discussion

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.110
To better understand Jesus words we need to answer three questions

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.909
First

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.909
What is the good news?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.469
Second

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.469
Why can we have faith in it?

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.110
and third

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.270
How can we build such faith?

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:38.030
Knowing the answers to these questions will help us to have faith in the good news and fill our life with real purpose

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:41.949
Well, let's address our first question

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.710
What specifically is the good news that Jesus was referring to?

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.629
Well, let's go back in the Bible this time to the book of Luke

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.060
in Luke chapter eight

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.289
notice Luke chapter eight

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.939
verse one

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.620
Shortly afterward he traveled from city to city and from village to village

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.860
preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.979
and the 12 were with him

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.340
So what was that good news that Jesus preached?

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.180
The verse states the good news of the kingdom of God

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.419
So an important aspect of the good news is the message about God's kingdom

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.219
This kingdom is a real government in heaven with the heavenly king and earthly subjects

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.500
Jesus earthly life as a grown man was devoted to preaching and declaring God's kingdom as the only solution to man's problems

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.699
And how did he do it?

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.259
What the simplest of tools is mouth and his feet

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:02.979
Notice he walked tirelessly from city to city and village to village hundreds of miles on dusty roads even without food at times

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.419
Just to share this message with others

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:15.699
He even taught his disciples this good news so that they could share and extend the good news well beyond the cities and villages that Jesus reached

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.579
And you might be wondering

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.620
Why should this good news that Jesus preached about 2000 years ago

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.740
Be of interest to us today

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:36.740
It's because the message of the good news that Jesus taught promises future blessings for obedient humans living under the rulership of God's kingdom

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.819
So that affects all mankind today that affects you and me

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.620
And these blessings will touch every facet of life

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.060
Let's consider a few examples

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:51.699
Let's start with our physical health

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:59.569
Turn with me please to the book of Isaiah and Isaiah chapter 33

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.009
And we're going to read the first part of verse 24

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.670
Isaiah 33 24 and no resident will say

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.829
I am sick

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:19.170
You know that's such a simple statement

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.769
But can you just process what that means?

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.970
To never again say or hear someone say

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.620
I'm sick. I don't feel well

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.779
Something is not right with me

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.899
Just think of the millions that have suffered illness due to the pandemic

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.910
The millions that are coping with the disability and then all the diseases

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.670
The diseases that are common

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.550
The diseases that are rare

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.430
The ones that are life-threatening

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.310
chronic

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.310
debilitating

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.069
The diseases where you look fine on the outside but inside

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.350
It's a day-to-day struggle

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:17.600
See under God's kingdom

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.480
All of it all disabilities all diseases all health problems will no longer plague mankind

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.800
They will all be a thing of the past

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.399
And just to show you how wonderful this is how far reaching this blessing will be

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:37.439
Even if we don't have a disease or disability think of what your life would be like right now

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.439
If you just didn't

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:44.350
Hurt

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.470
See right now it it hurts if we stand too long

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.629
It hurts if we sit too long hurts if we walk too long if we sleep too long

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.069
But to be pain-free

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:01.629
And to know that each day you're just going to feel better and better

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.389
Isn't that good news

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.069
You see so much is going to be accomplished from this promise

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.790
Where no one will say

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:16.029
I am sick

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:17.870
Well, let's consider another blessing

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:25.149
As a family head we know it's a priority for you to care for your family and keep a roof over their heads

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.310
But is it a struggle to make in me

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.990
How often do you worry about having a job or keeping your job?

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:40.029
Well, just think of how you'll feel when these words become a reality

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.029
Still in the book of Isaiah this time

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.029
Isaiah chapter 65

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.620
And note verses 21

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.990
And 22

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.750
They will build houses and live in them

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.709
And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.750
They will not build for someone else to inhabit

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.230
Nor will they plant for others to eat

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.990
For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:14.029
And the work of their hands my chosen ones will enjoy to the full

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.870
You see the blessing

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:21.230
No one will be homeless or unemployed

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:27.389
And did you know nowhere in these verses do we see the words rent or lease

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:35.710
Under this kingdom arrangement you say we're going to experience the full joy of ownership

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.590
Can you imagine that can you imagine the satisfaction

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:44.350
The dignity that comes from living in a home

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:50.750
You personally built and then working with your hands for the direct benefit of your family

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.110
It's a good feeling, isn't it?

00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:56.990
And of course if you're planning your own vineyard

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.990
Well, that's an indication of another blessing

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.789
And abundance of food

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.590
The Bible describes this quite beautifully term please to the book of Psalms

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.830
The 72nd Psalm

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.240
In note Psalm 72 verse 16

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:25.230
There will be an abundance of grain on the earth

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.190
On the top of the mountains it will overflow

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:31.230
His fruit will flourish as in Lebanon

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.870
And in the cities people will blossom like the vegetation of the earth

00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:43.299
We've all seen heartbreaking pictures of neglected and starving children

00:09:44.419 --> 00:09:48.100
And we've likely seen the increasing number of food lines during this pandemic

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.899
But you see under God's government

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.379
No one will be without sufficient food or undernourished

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:59.379
Poverty and food shortages will be gone

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:07.299
And what a beautiful word picture this verse gives us of how the ground will produce abundantly

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:14.179
It would be as if grain were growing along the sides of a mountain clear to the top and overflowing

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:18.340
You see we have so many wonderful blessings to look forward to

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.340
But for this next blessing

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:28.659
God will use his creative powers to do one of the most wonderful works of all time

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:31.620
Let's go back to the book of Isaiah

00:10:32.419 --> 00:10:34.419
This time Isaiah chapter 25

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:43.149
Verse 8

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:45.149
Isaiah 25

00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:49.330
Verse 8

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.009
There were told

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.570
He will swallow up death forever

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:58.370
And the sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:00.769
The reproach of His people

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.490
He will take away from all the earth

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.850
For Jehovah Himself has spoken it

00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:12.370
You know some may consider this to be the best news of all

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.090
What a joy it is going to be when death will be no more

00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:19.009
Remove forever

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.580
If any of us have ever had someone close to us taken away by death

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.860
We know the emptiness

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.860
The anguish

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.340
The painful scars that death leaves behind

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.460
And it's something that affects all of us

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.700
So just think how many memorial services have you attended since this pandemic

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.460
You see for some it's just too painful to think about

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:48.299
One brother made the statement he said

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:51.500
I don't even look forward to Saturdays anymore

00:11:52.299 --> 00:11:56.139
It seems that Saturdays have been set aside for funeral and memorial services

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.740
But we can relate to that can't we

00:12:00.379 --> 00:12:05.419
But you see what the Bible says the Bible says that God is going to swallow up death forever

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.299
So when something is swallowed it's gone

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.779
destroyed

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:13.019
So that is going to be a time to rejoice

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.220
But the good news doesn't stop there

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.820
Because not only is Jehovah going to put an end to death

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:23.019
But know what he does next

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:26.220
Look over chapter 26 this time verse 19

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.220
He says your dead will live

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.100
My corpses will rise up

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.220
Awake and shout joyfully you residents in the dust

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:39.100
For your ado is as the dew of the morning

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.059
And the earth will let those powerless in death

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.029
Come to life

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:48.750
So now we're talking about the resurrection

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:52.990
Our dead loved ones will return to life

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:58.990
And you know the expression there awake and shout joyfully

00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:03.789
Thought it was interesting the new English Bible quotes this as saying

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:06.509
They that sleep in the earth

00:13:07.309 --> 00:13:09.470
Will awake and shout for joy

00:13:10.909 --> 00:13:14.990
And doesn't that nicely describe how right now our dead loved ones

00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:17.789
Are just sleeping

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.789
And just like an infant is protected within its mother's womb

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.629
The dead are in the safest situation imaginable

00:13:26.669 --> 00:13:28.990
Perfectly preserved and protected

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:32.029
Within Jehovah's memory

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.629
And in God's due time they will be brought back to life

00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:38.429
And we can be there

00:13:38.429 --> 00:13:40.429
We can be there to warmly welcome them

00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:44.990
Just like a newborn is greeted by a loving waiting family

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.590
So many tremendous blessings

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.710
And these blessings that we've considered

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.509
This is just a small sampling of the good news

00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:57.870
There's so much more that this kingdom will accomplish

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.509
According to Psalm 46 verse 9 war will cease to exist

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:05.309
In Revelation 11 18

00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:08.350
Anyone and anything that dirties the earth

00:14:08.669 --> 00:14:12.190
Pollutes the air in water or kills off the earth's wildlife

00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:18.590
God promises that he will bring to ruin those who ruin or pollute the earth

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.960
So we've established the answer to our first question

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:28.159
What is the good news?

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:31.200
The good news is the news of God's kingdom

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.360
This heavenly government that will rule and provide tremendous blessings to obedient mankind

00:14:39.039 --> 00:14:42.080
Now with all these wonderful promises in store for mankind

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.919
Can you think of any better news that you'd like to receive?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.799
Wouldn't you agree that these promises are worth investigating?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.320
Indeed they are

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.720
But here's the challenge

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.120
The idea of living forever under such wonderful conditions might be difficult for some to comprehend

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.000
Especially what life is like right now at present

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.519
So what of those that hear this good news are skeptical

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:18.720
What if they feel if it seems too good to be true

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.740
It probably is

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.179
Well, let's address this by answering our second question

00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:31.259
Why can we have faith in the good news?

00:15:32.379 --> 00:15:38.940
In other words, why can we firmly believe that all the things we've just considered all these promises from God are true

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:42.139
And will be fulfilled

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.259
Well, just like any news or information that we receive

00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:51.019
The credibility all starts with the source, doesn't it?

00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:55.820
The good news comes from Jehovah God himself

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.940
And let's note what the Bible says about him

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.500
Turn with me please to the book of Titus

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:07.759
And Titus chapter one and we'll read

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.360
Titus chapter one

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.169
Verses one and two

00:16:15.169 --> 00:16:16.769
Paul

00:16:16.769 --> 00:16:21.570
A slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's chosen ones

00:16:22.289 --> 00:16:25.809
And the accurate knowledge of the truth that is according to godly devotion

00:16:26.289 --> 00:16:29.730
And is based on a hope of the everlasting life that God

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.610
Who cannot lie

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.129
promised

00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:36.129
Long ago

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.450
So we can be certain that these promises will be fulfilled

00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:46.049
Because the Bible tells us we have a basis for hope because God

00:16:46.769 --> 00:16:49.090
Who cannot lie

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.409
Is the one who made these promises

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
But what exactly does this mean?

00:16:56.289 --> 00:16:58.289
Well, let's illustrate it this way

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:03.330
Have you ever asked a friend to meet you or pick you up to go somewhere

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.849
And your friend says oh no problem. I'll be there at seven

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.369
But as soon as he says it

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.250
You already know he's not coming until 730

00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:16.289
Maybe even eight

00:17:16.289 --> 00:17:18.289
We all seem to have that friend don't we?

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.490
But why do we know this about our friend?

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.009
Well likely it's because of his past record

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.529
You see if our friend all the will intentioned has a pattern of being lead

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.009
He's given us a basis

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.890
To question his promise

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.490
Now of course as humans were all imperfect

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:46.289
But the point is our record of works form a basis for our credibility

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.329
So now we elevate this to Almighty God

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.130
So when it comes to Jehovah

00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:58.049
The source of the good news the one who cannot lie

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:04.049
You see if we examine his record we'll see that he has given us a basis to trust him

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:11.569
He has a perfect record of fulfilling his promises. They come true 100% of the time

00:18:13.089 --> 00:18:17.089
And it's not just the general prophecy itself

00:18:18.609 --> 00:18:20.769
It's the accurate details as well

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.349
For example

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:29.390
The prophet Isaiah 4 told that the mighty city of Babylon would be destroyed

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.990
But then he went into detail exactly how the city would be defeated

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.230
From the river being dried up

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.710
To the gates being left wide open

00:18:40.509 --> 00:18:44.829
He even named the one who was going to overthrow Babylon some 200 years before it happened

00:18:46.349 --> 00:18:51.390
And history confirms that every detail of this prophecy was fulfilled

00:18:52.349 --> 00:18:57.309
It was even prophesied that Babylon would become piles of stone and never again be inhabited

00:18:58.509 --> 00:19:01.069
And that stands true down to this day

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.269
And this is just one of a number of prophecies

00:19:06.829 --> 00:19:10.349
You see when we take the time to investigate we find other prophecies

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:13.549
Such as the number of years when the land of Judah would be desolate

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.829
The exact year when the Messiah would come where he would be born what he would do

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.829
How he would die and be raised from the dead

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.109
All fulfilled

00:19:24.109 --> 00:19:26.430
Exactly as foretold

00:19:28.349 --> 00:19:32.910
So the fact that so many Bible prophecies have already come true

00:19:33.869 --> 00:19:38.829
Shows that we can trust what the Bible says about the future

00:19:41.019 --> 00:19:44.220
Now here's another reason we can have faith in the good news

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:48.380
Let's go back to our Bibles this time to Matthew chapter 9

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.900
In Matthew chapter 9

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.299
Note verse 35

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.369
And Jesus sat out on a tour of all the cities and villages

00:20:05.089 --> 00:20:11.970
Teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity

00:20:13.329 --> 00:20:17.569
Now you recall earlier we discussed the efforts Jesus put forth to declare the good news

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:23.250
But now we see that as he went to those cities and villages not only did he preach

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:30.609
But empowered by God he performed miracles that prove the credibility of the good news

00:20:32.289 --> 00:20:35.569
And some of those miracles were witnessed by thousands

00:20:36.849 --> 00:20:40.450
To the point where they cannot be denied even by his apostles

00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:45.089
So to this point

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:48.769
We've established what the good news is the news regarding God's kingdom

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.890
And now we've answered why we can have faith in the good news

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.329
The source of the good news is Jehovah

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.730
A God who cannot lie and who has a perfect track record of keeping his promises

00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:09.089
And then God's son Jesus Christ who is king of God's kingdom

00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:15.569
He solidified that evidence during his time on the earth by demonstrating the power to cure disease

00:21:16.289 --> 00:21:19.299
and infirmity

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:25.619
Today there are millions of people from a variety of backgrounds that have taken the time to investigate the promises

00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:27.859
Of God's kingdom

00:21:27.859 --> 00:21:29.859
They have found them to be true

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.660
And they have benefited from the good news

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.460
It has improved their lives now and given them a solid hope for the future

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:41.059
We invite you to watch the following video

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.579
And as you do note how some have benefited from the good news

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.190
Normally my home country

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.190
I had many questions

00:22:00.509 --> 00:22:02.029
Why do young people have to die?

00:22:02.829 --> 00:22:04.750
Why do my children have to go through this?

00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:07.789
God did not create us to make war

00:22:08.829 --> 00:22:12.190
The priests in my church always said it is God's will

00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:16.029
Being on the run was dreadful

00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:18.349
More than once I thought we were going to die

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:24.430
Eventually we arrived in Germany and I was convinced that the priest there could give me some answers

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.390
I went to several different churches

00:22:28.349 --> 00:22:29.549
But no answers

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.470
I kept telling them I'm looking for something

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:34.509
I don't know what it is

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.150
But I didn't find it here with you

00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:41.789
Sometimes I thought I was searching for something that no one could give me

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.380
One day

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.420
A German woman approached me in Arabic

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.819
That was amazing for me

00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:53.940
I never had a good opinion of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.140
I didn't think I could learn anything from her

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.140
But I gave her a chance

00:22:59.859 --> 00:23:04.339
She gave me logical answers to all of my questions

00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:12.019
In my home country there are multiple religious groups and nationalities

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.220
Who hate and fight each other

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.180
But at the meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:22.180
I have seen that all people can live in peace with each other

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.819
If they get to know our father in heaven

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.220
He gives love and peace

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.859
At last, I found what I had been looking for

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.059
I lived a life without rules

00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:47.740
I used to get drunk, smoked a lot, and I became a compulsive gambler

00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:51.500
My behavior was a complete disaster

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:55.420
My wife wanted to separate from me

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.619
It was a horrible time

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.900
My wife started studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses

00:24:04.539 --> 00:24:06.140
I remember being doubtful

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:07.980
Very doubtful

00:24:09.819 --> 00:24:12.779
But there was one thing that started to make me think

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:17.420
Both my wife and my children look more peaceful

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.019
More joyful

00:24:19.819 --> 00:24:20.380
Happier

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.700
That's why I even accepted a Bible study

00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:31.250
I came to realize that Jehovah loves each one of us as an individual

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.769
That gave me real hope for the future

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.769
Everything I was studying in the Bible helped me to understand

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.609
The doing Jehovah's world is in our best interest

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:48.019
This really helped me to quit my bad habits

00:24:49.059 --> 00:24:50.579
Treat my family better

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.940
And show due respect to my wife

00:24:55.859 --> 00:24:57.779
If Jehovah hadn't searched for me

00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:00.019
If I hadn't come to know him

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.500
We would no longer be a family

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.779
Today we are indeed a happy family

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.940
A united family

00:25:10.819 --> 00:25:12.500
United more than ever

00:25:16.289 --> 00:25:19.329
Only Jehovah could perform such a miracle

00:25:23.869 --> 00:25:25.710
Well, let's address our final question

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:30.109
How can you and I build faith in the good news

00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:34.430
It may be that just like our sister in the video

00:25:35.309 --> 00:25:39.549
We have gone through situations in our life that leave us searching for answers

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:46.670
But our search might provide us with incorrect or misinformed information about God

00:25:48.109 --> 00:25:49.630
So the question comes up again

00:25:50.829 --> 00:25:54.670
How can we know how can we be sure of what to believe

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.029
Well the Bible gives us the answer

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.670
Turn with me please to the book of Hebrews

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.619
And note what is stated in Hebrews chapter 11

00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:13.630
verse 1

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.630
There we read

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.990
Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for

00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:24.430
The evident demonstration of realities that are not seen

00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:29.309
And you know the footnote there for evident demonstration

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.230
It says convincing evidence

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.589
So that helps us to see that real faith is not gullible

00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:43.869
Just like with the scammers and misinformation we spoke of earlier

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.069
You say we don't believe what we hear just because it sounds good

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:54.349
No as the footnote says there should be convincing evidence of things that are not seen

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.630
And yet real

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.349
Just illustrate this a child may ask

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.710
How do we know that air exists

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.950
Well, we can't say well, it just does that's how it works

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:14.430
No, you say likely we'd have to help the child to reason on the evidence that exist

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.190
Right his ability to breathe air in and out

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.309
The effects of the wind and so forth

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.549
And once the child is convinced of the evidence

00:27:26.589 --> 00:27:28.910
He can now accept the existence

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:31.950
Of what is invisible to him

00:27:33.069 --> 00:27:34.829
In this case the air

00:27:36.349 --> 00:27:38.990
And that is how our faith has to be

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:44.029
It has to be based on solid convincing evidence

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.140
Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide have faith in the good news

00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:55.819
They have made an examination of the Bible's promises and they've seen the evidence for themselves

00:27:56.619 --> 00:27:58.380
Just like our brother in the video

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.900
We've also seen how the good news is not only improved our lives

00:28:02.859 --> 00:28:06.460
But it shows us evidence of Jehovah's love for us as well

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.220
Some who are listening to this program may be newly acquainted with Jehovah's Witnesses

00:28:14.339 --> 00:28:18.579
And we'd like to tell you we are so happy that you took the time to attend

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.099
And we know that you too may have questions

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.140
And you need answers

00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:27.299
truthful answers

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:29.299
Well

00:28:29.299 --> 00:28:31.299
Give Jehovah's Witnesses a chance

00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:35.299
Give them a chance to help you find those answers in the Bible

00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:38.259
And as you associate with them

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:40.660
See how they have come to believe the good news

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.180
And why they have faith in it

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.579
And as your faith grows

00:28:44.579 --> 00:28:48.180
You'll come to appreciate just how important this message is

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.619
It will move you to make any needed changes in your life

00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:55.220
And because of the joy and happiness you feel

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.380
You say you'll be excited right you'll want to share what you have learned with others

00:29:00.259 --> 00:29:01.779
And that's good

00:29:01.779 --> 00:29:05.619
For doing so we'll reinforce Bible truth in your own mind

00:29:07.539 --> 00:29:09.539
So from all that we've discussed

00:29:10.819 --> 00:29:12.819
What do we conclude

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.619
If we have faith in the good news

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:22.900
We are firmly convinced that everything Jehovah says is true and will be fulfilled

00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:25.940
And the way we live our lives will demonstrate that

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.420
In this world that is saturated with so much bad news

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:36.259
How thankful we are that we have a God that not only provides us with a basis to trust his good news

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.859
But he even shows evidence of his care and concern for us as individuals

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:49.539
This good news is not too good to be true. It is real. It is a reality that is soon to come

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.500
So may all of us

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.460
Have faith in the good news

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.420
And as we draw close to God

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:06.900
May we experience first hand Jehovah's love as he rewards all those who earnestly seek him in faith
