00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.520
For those who found the truth later in life,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.519
it may have been a big decision to choose to serve Jehovah.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.519
That was the case for brother Michael Lemoine

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.519
from the United States.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.519
When his wife started studying the Bible with the witnesses,

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.519
he was not pleased.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.519
His upbringing made her newly found faith

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.850
difficult to accept.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.850
I was the youngest of a family of three.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.850
We lived in a little bit of town in Louisiana.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.850
It was predominantly Catholic.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.350
In the Catholic Church, the way that we were taught to pray

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.350
was a set of repetitive prayers.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.350
Really, it was easy to pray like that,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.350
because you really didn't have to think.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
Once you had those prayers memorized,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.350
which was at a very early age.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.340
It was just a rote around the time that I was just about out of college

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.340
going into law school.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.340
There was something missing.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.340
I wanted to be close to God, but I didn't know how.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:13.340
I met Sharon in 1986,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.340
and we ended up getting married the following year.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.340
Sharon, I, because she had been divorced,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
we were not allowed to have our marriage be conducted

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.340
in the Catholic Church with a priest.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.340
That didn't bother me at first, but over time it did.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.340
I asked them what it would take for us to be able to bless our marriage.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.340
She would have to undergo a period of sessions of religious training.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.340
When he asked me that, I said, yeah, I'll study with him.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.340
We never, ever opened up a Bible.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.340
It was a little disappointing.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.269
Around that same time, there was a zealous sister.

00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:01.269
I would study with her, and it was all Bible.

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:05.269
As I continued learning about the Bible,

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:08.270
the reasoning from the Scriptures was so great.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.270
It was something that I knew I wasn't going to be able to brush off.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.270
So she came forward and said, I have something to tell you.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.270
I have been studying with the Jehovah's Witnesses for a period of time.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.270
I am convinced that this is the true religion,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.270
and I do not want to participate anymore in the Catholic faith,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.270
the Catholic Church.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.270
What moved me to tell Mike about my Bible study was Genesis 6.6.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.270
It matters what we do, how we can affect Jehovah,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.270
that he could feel hurt in his heart, and it crushed me.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:58.990
It crushed me because of the love that he has for us.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.990
I considered to be the dark years because there was so much animosity on my part.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.990
I was trying to do anything he could to get me to stop.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:16.990
I even talked about divorce, thinking that the shock and awe treatment might bring it to her senses.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.990
He would actually pack up a suitcase and leave.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.990
She, in fact, was becoming a better wife and a better mother.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.990
The sister, my teacher, should say,

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.990
this is good that he is being so zealous about his faith because he loves God.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.990
Like Paul, you know, he thought that was the right thing to do.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.360
I was trained as a lawyer.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.360
I get a case.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.360
I usually know nothing about it.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360
I do an investigation.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.360
I retain experts to help me understand what I don't understand.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.360
So, naturally, I'm going to go to my church.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.360
I'm going to go to my religious leaders.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.360
My spiritual leaders and get them to help me with this.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.360
I made an appointment with a very, very high-ranking priest.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.360
I told him that my wife was studying with the Jehovah's Witnesses

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.360
and I was seeking some help.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.360
And the first thing that he told me, and I'll never forget this,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:26.360
he looked straight at me and said it would take nothing short of a miracle for me to pull my wife away from the Jehovah's Witnesses

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.360
because they knew the Bible so well.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.360
In my life at that point where I'm struggling, I'm trying to win over my family,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.360
that was a devastating day.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:49.360
So I said, Michael, the Bible, the book from God, you don't know.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.360
Why not study it?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.360
Why not study that?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.360
Like you study, the law books are the cases.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.360
I decided that I would go with her on Sunday, on Sunday only,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.360
and only for the first half hour.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:15.360
I'd say it was at least a year that I went to meetings with the aim of learning and refuting it.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.019
But for now, you see how that relates to the question.

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:26.019
You read that the Earth will stay forever, that there is no Trinity,

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:31.019
there is a name for God the Father, and there is no Hellfire, there is no Perkatory.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.019
These things were refreshing.

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:36.019
I was totally convinced.

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:43.019
By October 1996, I wrote my letter to the same priest who thought it was going to be a miracle for me to get my wife out

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:46.019
and informed him that I was withdrawing from the Catholic faith.

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:59.279
A large part of the transition that I made was because of the friends and the congregation,

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.279
I was not a person that you'd want to approach.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.279
But then when I decided to make the change, and it was fast,

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.279
these people never treated me any differently.

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.279
Their arms were always open.

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:20.660
Jesus tells us that no one can come to the Father unless Jehovah draws that person.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.439
What He saw, I don't know.

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:34.439
I oftentimes pray to Him, and I don't know what to say,

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:43.220
but I'm deeply appreciative of what He's done for me.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:51.220
You'll be happy to know that Brother Lemoine now serves as an elder in the coordinator of the body of elders of their congregation.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.220
His wife Sharon and their children serve as regular pioneers.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:05.220
And Sister Lemoine proved through her loyalty to Jehovah that it is possible to stand firm despite persecution from family members.
