00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:16.480
Jehovah has often taught his people with visual imagery.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.480
Profits and apostles receive visions that made God's purpose clear.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.480
Even early in our modern day history, many were drawn to the truth by the photo drama of creation.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.479
Today, the teaching committee of the governing body oversees the work of video production worldwide.

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:41.479
To assist them, the audio video services department was formed in Brooklyn in 1991.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:45.479
This location was suitable for a time.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:52.479
But as the faithful slaves saw the need to use video more extensively, the workspace had to grow.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:01:00.479
So the department moved to Patterson Bethel in 1998, making good use of its first dedicated studios.

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:07.480
But the need for videos kept growing, so a building near Patterson was purchased in 2012.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.480
International remote video teams also lend their valuable support.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.480
Still, a larger space was needed at world headquarters in Patterson.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:27.480
Our brothers prayed for a solution that would expand the workspace while making the best use of our donations.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
Let's see how Jehovah answered their prayers.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:50.519
The audio video department had a scene a tremendous growth over the last few years.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:56.519
About five years ago, we were just producing one large video, a year, and a handful of smaller videos.

00:01:56.519 --> 00:02:04.519
But now, in the last year, 2016 year, audio video services produced over 350 videos.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:09.520
On an average, we're making one video every single day.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.520
That's just amazing amount of work that's being done.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.520
You think about videos for the ministry at JW Broadcasting, a midweek meetings, convention videos, school videos.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.520
There's so much content to be used throughout the organization, which is fantastic.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520
But that means more personnel is necessary.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.520
And so with more personnel, obviously more space is needed as well.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.520
One of the challenges to our existing space at Patterson is that we have three relatively small studios.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.520
We looked at building additional facilities right there at Patterson, but that didn't seem like a good option.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.520
We found that building just wouldn't meet the significant growth.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.520
It wouldn't help us deal with the challenges fast enough.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.520
Realizing our need, the governing body approved that we find a property nearby with a building large enough for a studio.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.520
And that's not easy because there's only so many buildings in size and nature that could meet some of the needs we had.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.520
Back at the end of 2014, early 2015, a broker alerted us to the availability of this facility here.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.520
It was ideal because it was located just seven minutes away, a seven minute drive from Patterson.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.909
It's perfect for us for our needs because it's a big space.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.909
And that's what we need to build multiple sets, so 70,000 square feet of warehouse.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.909
And we also need offices.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.909
And there was 20,000 square feet of offices already in place in that building.

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.909
The facility here at Mount Ebo was great in that it was three stories high and had so much square footage.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.909
But it also had some challenges.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:59.909
Without dividing it into smaller sections, to have more than one production team at a time using the space would be nearly impossible.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:06.909
It was decided that an outside construction company would be used to do the majority of the renovation work at Mount Ebo.

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.909
We made a number of improvements to the building.

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:14.909
The walls were sprayed with an inch to an inch and a half of acoustic absorption material.

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.910
This material is made out of newspaper with glue.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.910
Those two things are sprayed on the walls.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.910
That thickness then will help absorb the sound waves that are traveling inside the room and help prevent echo from occurring inside the studio.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.910
Now we have three separate dedicated studios.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.910
So with the sound proofing that was installed, they can be filming on one stage and we can be building in another.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.910
There doesn't have to be a shutdown during filming.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.910
We also have a beautiful area now set aside specifically for prop storage.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.910
So we have props on site. We don't have to go to a warehouse to get them.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:03.910
Creating an area that's devoted to storing all our wardrobe and having a separate area for all of our tech equipment, cameras, lighting, etc.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.910
Those things just made the building not only usable but just ideal for video production.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.910
The office space was another plus.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.910
Those received a little refurbishing to upgrade the finishes.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.910
And a small cafeteria was provided to feed the crews at lunchtime here.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.910
Many ask why we refer to this building as Mount Ibo.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.910
Well, it just happens to be the name of the industrial park where this building is located.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.910
That's what it was referred to previously. So we kept the name.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.910
The Teach Committee loves what the department is doing for the Worldwide Brotherhood.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.910
They care deeply not only about facilities but the people that are doing the work.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:53.910
And so we've planned a trip up to see the new facilities and also to give some words of encouragement to the hardworking brothers and sisters there.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:03.910
Our brothers and sisters with these videos are being motivated to do more for Jehovah, to live up to their dedication and help others to do the same.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.910
We know Jehovah can cause to become whatever is needed to fulfill his will.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.910
But he can also cause us to become.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:22.910
He can cause us as individuals and as a department to become whatever is needed to fulfill the will that he has here in regards to video work.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:30.910
So we're excited to see how that further takes shape and how Jehovah decides to use these facilities even further in the future.
