00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.070
Now, there's much for us to think about in these words of Proverbs 12 and verse 18.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.849
And to all of us, we like to think of ourselves as wise, but we all know that from time to time

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.289
we still stab our brothers and sisters with our speech, thoughtless speech.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.089
Now, we all know that we need to watch our speech, say things that are positive or upbuilding,

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.550
but isn't it true that sometimes we may find that we have ourselves in a negative thinking

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.590
pattern that we cannot get out of that exhibits itself in our speech.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.390
Well, what can help us?

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.990
Well, you notice our theme, Scripture in Proverbs 12, 18 says the tongue of a wise person

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.509
is a healing.

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.670
So what can help us to be wise?

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.109
What can help us to have healing and positive speech?

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.229
Well, let's consider three things this morning.

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.469
The first is a wise person's maintained perspective.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.630
Now sometimes we may find that our speech is negative or cutting because we're frustrated.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.310
But yet stepping back and looking at things from a broader perspective, many times can

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.469
help us to be wise, to control our tongue.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.750
Now in this context, many times I think about Job.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.950
When we look at Job's words, we find that he really said some hurtful things.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.390
Job chapter 40 and verse 2, Job calls Job a fault finder.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.189
Job was finding fault with Jehovah.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.189
Why?

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.069
Well, from Job's perspective, an injustice was being done.

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.909
In fact, turn, if you will, to Job chapter 9.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.069
Just notice some of the things that Job says about Jehovah.

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.590
Job 9 verses 15 through 18, just skimming through there.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.709
You notice in verse 15, he says, even if I were in the right, I would not answer him.

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:50.310
If I call out to him, will he answer me?

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.150
I do not believe he'll even listen to my voice.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.790
Verse 17, he crushes me with a storm.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.310
18, he does not let me catch my breath.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.269
Look at verse 34 and 35.

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:07.670
Job says of Jehovah, if he would just stop beating me, then I would speak to him unafraid.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.469
Why, these words are stabs of a sword, stinging criticism of Jehovah.

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:18.750
But now, what helped Job to correct his thinking and therefore, again, to have positive speech?

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.750
It was perspective.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.990
Remember, Jehovah pulled him back to see things from a different perspective.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.590
And how we think of the words there and his questions in Job 38, where Jehovah says,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.189
well, Job, let me ask you a few questions now.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.270
Can you remind me again, where was it you were at when I created the earth?

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.110
I don't remember seeing you anywhere.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.909
Or who commands the morning?

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.150
Or Job, let me ask you, where does light come from?

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.150
Ideas?

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.909
I didn't think so.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.509
See, what was Jehovah doing?

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:52.430
See, Jehovah was pulling Job back to see things from a broader perspective.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.750
It allowed him to see his issues in context.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.349
And what was the result?

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.069
Well, in Job 42, in verse 3, he says, I spoke without understanding.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.310
In verse 6, he says, can you just take back everything I said, just erase what I said?

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.550
What's the point?

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.629
The point is, is that meditating on a broader perspective can help us to have positive

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:14.629
speech.

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.909
See, we have to remember that it's not all about us.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.990
The world does not revolve around us, and there are bigger issues at play.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.710
And that perspective can help us to be wise.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.430
It can help us to control our speech.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.629
Now second point is that a wise person is humble.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.150
And notice what a wise person will do.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.550
Look at Proverbs chapter 1 and verse 5.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:44.150
Proverbs 1 verse 5 says, a wise person listens and takes in more instruction.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.669
Now it takes humility to listen.

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.110
Now we contrast at what Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 2.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.990
Proverbs chapter 18 verse 2 says, a stupid person takes no pleasure in understanding.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.389
He would rather disclose what is in his heart.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.509
You see, a stupid person, he doesn't have time to listen.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:05.229
He array knows what the story is and therefore speaks accordingly.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.030
Well, am I a wise or a stupid person?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.469
We'll see humility will help us to realize that we do not always have the whole story.

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.189
We don't always have all the facts.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:20.350
And when we listen and we get a full perspective, many times that changes our thinking.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.949
How many times that's happened to you?

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.589
I know it's happened to me that once we step back, we hear the whole story, we realize

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:28.470
we didn't know what we were talking about.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.430
We weren't speaking out of wisdom, but rather out of ignorance.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.470
You see, that realization, that humility will then help us do what it says here in Proverbs 17 and verse 27.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.149
Notice what a wise person does.

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:46.470
See, a man of knowledge restrains his words, a discerning man will remain calm.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.069
So what's the point?

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.990
Well, the point is humility can help us to be wise.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.350
Humble people listen to others and therefore realizing that we don't have all the facts

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.790
and helps us to restrain our words, remain calm and to be wise.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.990
Now our third point is that a wise person is realistic.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.750
And we have to be careful that we do not overthink things at times.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.269
You see, in this organization, we have just absolutely brilliant brothers and sisters.

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:20.269
Many of you, you can look at a situation and see how to straighten it out and make it faster,

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:24.110
smoother, better, more efficient, and that is a gift.

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:27.550
But we have to be careful that we do not overthink things.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.029
See, sometimes we may look at something and say, well, you know, that is the most ridiculous

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.829
process I've ever seen in my life.

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:38.110
And you know what, maybe it is, but we cannot optimize everything.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.829
It will only end up frustrating ourselves, which will cause us to be cynical, which ends

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:44.670
up coming out in our speech.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.110
Now I find the book of Ecclesiastes of much benefit as it carries realistic thinking.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.509
Look at Ecclesiastes chapter 2 and verse 15.

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.910
Ecclesiastes 2, 15 says, then I said in my heart, what happens to the stupid one will also

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.709
happen to me.

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:06.069
What then did I gain by becoming excessively wise?

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.389
This too is futility.

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.790
You see, we may have a better solution.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.790
Good.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.790
Share it.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.790
Share it with our oversight.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.790
Be wise.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.230
But Solomon's reminding us, do not be excessively wise.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.230
Do not become so fixated on it that we start to become bitter, which comes out in our

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.629
speech.

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:30.629
As we've heard before, we cannot expect perfection from an imperfect process where imperfect

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.029
people are involved.

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:35.790
If we expect that, we'll only end up frustrating ourselves and others.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.069
We also remember that anyone can complain about an imperfect process.

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:41.069
That's easy to do.

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:42.350
All of us can do that.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.990
But the real gem of a person, the one that can be used and most by Jehovah is the one

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.709
who can take an imperfect process and make it work.

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:53.230
Now along that line, we may think of Jesus.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.670
He could have spent his last three and a half years of life here on earth, complaining

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.670
to Jehovah, couldn't he?

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.949
See, he could have complained about the imperfect men that he had to work with.

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:06.750
He could have complained about the failed religious structure that was in place.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.670
He could have complained that he didn't even have a decent place to live.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.550
Why foxes and birds live better than I do?

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.470
He could have complained about the flaws in the temple arrangement and the synagogue.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.350
There's many things Jesus could have complained about and he could have become bitter.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.550
This would have reflected itself in his speech, but he didn't do that.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:32.230
See, Jesus is a beautiful example of taking an imperfect process and still making it a success,

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.870
making it work.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.430
And so therefore, this helped him to be positive.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:42.629
This helped him to speak in a way that others said never has another man spoken like this.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.110
So what's the point?

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.189
Well, the point is, is that perspective, humility, being realistic.

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:54.389
This can help us to be wise and this can help us to have healing and positive speech

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:57.470
with our dear brothers and sisters that we work with and we live with.
