00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:16.250
In the Netherlands there was a need for a new suitable assembly hole, which could accommodate almost all of the 300 congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.250
Additional building ground was acquired next to the existing hole, so that a second completely new hole could be constructed.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.309
More than 200 volunteers worked on this project.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.310
What challenges did they face?

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:42.079
And what blessings did they receive?

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.079
We had to sell our house and close our business.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.079
It's a step in the unknown.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.079
I had to quit my job.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.579
It was exciting to step out of my comfort zone and rely completely on Jehovah.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.579
Everything is structured organized. That is why things run smoothly.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.579
That doesn't come naturally to me.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.579
We were invited to come and work in the kitchen.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.579
I love to cook at home. I'm really fond of it.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:27.819
What was my assignment? Doing the dishes.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.819
Working on yourself, your Christian personality and cooperating with your brothers and sisters.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.420
That has everlasting value.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.420
This was a wonderful training for the future when we will be building together in paradise.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.420
They realize that everyone sacrifices something and becomes happier.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
No one regrets their decision.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.420
Let Jehovah take into account your personal makeup that he is patient with us.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.959
I've really learned how to work together in a theoretical arrangement and still have fun.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.959
You can work on yourself all day long and therefore be able to improve.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.960
I really learned to study more, to read the Bible more often.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.960
Because we work together so closely, you get to know each other very well.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.960
And I really started to love and appreciate people.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:30.349
We really came to appreciate that every brother and sister has this beautiful inner person.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:43.020
Visitors or contractors were always very surprised that there were so many women working at the construction site.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.020
It's great working with sisters.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.020
I have a construction background and communication with men can be really upfront.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.020
That doesn't work with sisters.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.020
You just have to be calm, talk and listen.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:12.639
I had to work on a lift platform, but I was kind of a problem because I'm afraid of heights.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:18.639
The brothers were so kind to seal the sides up completely so that I could not look down.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.639
It was fun working together on that lift platform. We called it a little flat.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.639
The atmosphere was amazing and we all had a great time.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:39.139
It is now we work in the kitchen at the Sifftuban School Facility.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.139
A real privilege. We've been trained to cook during construction.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.139
But if needed, I'll even do the dishes as well.

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.860
I'll never work five days again.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.860
Now I work three days and since you live first, I started by a neary. That's just great.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.860
He was offered a job. He could even choose between two jobs.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.860
Now he works three days a week, which always seemed impossible.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.860
Eventually, we were in Sifftubanth for one month only.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.860
Then we went to Mozambique for three months.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.860
Then for five months to Sifftubanth again.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.860
In three months, South Africa.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.860
And the visiting for us and the battle called and assigned us to Congo King Shasa.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:44.689
All the volunteers who helped to make a success of this project, well, they had to give up a lot.

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.689
As a result, we can enjoy this beautiful hall.

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:56.220
It's amazing to be here. It's great to be encouraged and to be strengthened for the ministry.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.220
If you think about it, every day we have around 700 new brothers and sisters.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.220
That means every three days we can fill a hall like this with new brothers and sisters.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:15.220
These kind of halls are really needed worldwide in order to provide education to all those additional brothers and sisters.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.220
It's so face strengthening to be here.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.220
Words cannot express it. I feel so united, so warm.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.220
Peaceful.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.220
It's so wonderful to be able to serve Jehovah together.
