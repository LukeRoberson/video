00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:11.429
Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.429
With those words, Jesus commissioned His followers to share the good news about the kingdom of God.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:28.429
This message brought comfort for those distressed and made available the hope of everlasting life for all mankind.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.429
It's by means of God's kingdom that this will be accomplished.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:38.429
In our day, the same message is being conveyed on a much larger scale.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:47.429
For over 100 years, Jehovah's Witnesses have been organized for this very purpose.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:55.429
They speak this message in hundreds of languages.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:02.429
They deliver it in more than 230 land.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:08.430
Bringing solace to millions in a troubled world.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.430
That is why we shall not fear the earth undergo change.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.430
It has become the greatest preaching campaign the world has ever known.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:47.959
Jehovah's Witnesses are well known for living by Bible standards.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.959
Who really are Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:59.959
Some of them may be your neighbors.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.959
People you meet every day.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:15.960
However, it is their Bible education program that is most visible to others.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.960
How is their activity organized, directed and financed?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.960
New York, USA, world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses since 1909.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.960
It is also the location of the largest of the more than 100 branches of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:51.960
In the first century, the sharing of good news was governed by a body of spirit anointed men.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.960
Likewise today, the entire worldwide organization is directed by a group of mature Christian men called the government body.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.960
These men have appointed other committees of Jehovah's Witnesses to direct the worldwide preaching.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.960
I remember the agenda deals with the field service report for the United States. Any comments?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.960
Branch facilities include a home named Bethel.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.960
That is a Bible word, meaning House of God, an appropriate name for the type of work that is being done.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:41.310
Known as the Bethel family, thousands of spiritual men and women from various backgrounds freely volunteer their time and talents,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:50.310
everything they do at Bethel is ultimately linked to Jesus' command to preach the good news of the kingdom in all the earth.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:04:09.500
The writing department provides spiritual information that is prepared in the form of magazines, brochures, books and booklets

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:21.379
for the entire organization. The research is careful and thorough. The information, reliable and authoritative.

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:30.860
The purpose of the Watchtower magazine is to exalt Jehovah God as sovereign Lord of the universe.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.860
It encourages faith in God's now-raining King Jesus Christ.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:45.860
It comforts all peoples with the good news of God's kingdom and keeps watch on world events as they fulfill Bible prophecy.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.860
A Wake magazine shows how to cope with today's problems by using the Bible.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:01.860
It points to the real meaning behind current events, yet always stays politically neutral and does not elevate one race above another.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:10.860
Most important, a Wake Bill's confidence in the creator's promise of a paradise earth.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.860
In order to spread the good news, translators are vital.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:28.860
The Watchtower magazine is printed simultaneously in more than 140 languages, adding to the unity of this international organization.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.860
It looks we have received back the answer to the question we have asked the translation services.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.860
Okay, very good. Let's look at it.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.860
It's right here on the screen.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.860
The Bible is the main textbook of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:55.860
The translation services department provides help for translation of the Bible and other publications into many different languages.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.860
The here in this corner you have the English text.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.860
Computer programs speed up the process of translation and improve its accuracy.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.860
Printing Bible literature in over 400 languages requires a large array of character sets.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:31.910
Jehovah's Witnesses designed a unique multi-language electronic photo-type setting system known as MEPs to compose pages in the languages being printed.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.910
By using MEPs, life-saving literature reaches people in many languages.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:45.850
This message is also enhanced through pictures.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:07:16.939
In addition to artwork, scenes are staged and photographed for use in our publications.

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:19.939
Craig, I think we're really close. We can probably go to the left just a little bit more.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:24.939
I like that. That's a good idea. Okay, sweetie. On this one we have to look really sad.

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:43.139
I know just what you mean because I feel the same way.

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:49.139
But on this subject I have a wonderful magazine that talks about why bad things happen.

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:56.139
Electronic files of publications are made available to printing branches around the world.

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:08.540
These branches then print and distribute the literature to the congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses in their respective geographical regions.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:20.060
Printaries in various countries produce magazines and also bind in book form Bible literature.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.060
The largest of these is located near the town of Walkill, New York, USA.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:36.019
Jehovah's Witnesses began their own printing operations in New York in 1920.

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:39.019
The purpose then?

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:44.980
And now, published Bible truth.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:57.850
What is printed here can mean life to the reader.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.850
Jesus said at John 173,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.850
this means everlasting life.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:16.559
They're taking in knowledge of you the only true God and of the one whom you said forth, Jesus Christ.

00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:23.559
To keep up with the growing printing demands of Jehovah's Witnesses, high speed presses are required.

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:31.769
In one year nearly two billion pieces of literature are printed.

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:39.840
In the bindery printed pages become bound books.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.840
Signatures of books are assembled and glued together on high speed equipment.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:53.840
Nearly 1.7 million bound books and Bibles are produced each month by just the Walkill printer.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:00.840
The same type of work is done at various branches strategically situated around the world.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.840
These books are more than ink and paper.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:15.840
Bible-based publications have changed thinking, attitudes, habits and the very personalities of millions of persons, young and old.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:29.149
The Bible states at Hebrews 4.12 that the word of God is alive and exerts power and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:36.149
All publications produced here focus on the book most used by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:39.940
The Bible.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:50.940
The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures is an accurate, easy to understand, fresh translation of God's word designed for Bible study.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:56.940
The number of printed copies passed the 100 million mark at the turn of this century.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:11.269
In addition to printed publications, audio and video programs also communicate Bible truth.

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:29.419
By means of DVDs and CDs, the audio video services department produces programs in many languages that reach millions worldwide.

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:45.259
While producing audio video programs and printed publications is one thing, shipping them is another.

00:11:45.259 --> 00:11:53.389
The congregation literature orders are first gathered and packed.

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:56.389
Later, they are sorted for distribution.

00:11:56.389 --> 00:12:17.850
In addition to the shipping department at Wal-Kill, similar operations are cared for at the other print relocations worldwide.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:30.080
While a number of branches print and bind looks, much literature still must be shipped to other countries in each geographic region.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:45.840
From initial research and writing to printing and binding, as much as two years may have elapsed, home lifesaving literature is on its way.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:55.100
The world today, we say that can recognize that all mankind are in need of much comfort.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:04.100
The visually impaired are reached with the good news through the New World Translation and dozens of other Bible publications in Braille.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:11.379
Text from the writing department is converted into Braille and publications are embossed.

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:22.250
Each issue of the Watchtower magazine is available to the visually impaired by subscription.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:32.139
The death and hearing impaired are also reached with the good news.

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:38.139
By means of Bible publications translated into sign language and recorded on video.

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:57.210
Millions, shake and go, know what time period, people leave it, wicked, he avenge, flood, destroy, same as now, all over will.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:08.210
While American sign language is used in many countries, approval has been given to produce Bible literature in more than 35 different sign languages worldwide.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:25.340
Witnesses place a high value on life and desire the best medical treatment available.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:37.340
Based on Bible injunctions in both the ancient Hebrew and in the Christian Greek scriptures, blood transfusion is not a medical option for Jehovah's Witnesses' Earthwide.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:50.340
To assist in this area, the Hospital Information Services Department researches medical literature to keep up to date with rapidly advancing alternatives to blood transfusion.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:57.340
Such alternatives are now widely accepted and used by physicians worldwide.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:11.340
Hospital Information Services also provides training for thousands of elders who serve on some 1,500 Hospital liaison committees.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:23.340
These committees seek out skilled physicians who are willing to provide care without donor blood.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:30.340
The service department in each branch territory manages the preaching activity.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:40.340
The local elders agree, the circuit overseer agrees, you've got a good number of publishers, this is fine.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:53.580
They also correspond with traveling overseers and record the efforts of Jehovah's Witnesses in the field ministry each month.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:16:01.580
With thousands of new congregations being formed each year, there is a constant demand for more kingdom halls.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:07.860
In many countries, innovative, quick construction methods are used.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:27.789
Rapid growth in the number of Jehovah's Witnesses calls for expansion of many of the branches worldwide.

00:16:27.789 --> 00:16:29.789
How are they financed?

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:38.789
All expenses are met by voluntary donations, no dues, tithes or collections.

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:44.789
Following the Bible principle, each one contributes as he has resolved in his heart.

00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:56.340
The organization has become proficient in designing and engineering its own housing and printing buildings.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.340
It helps us to take advantage of what's going on inside the printer.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.340
Excellent, I think the brothers will have some really nice choices with this.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:09.339
I really think option B will meet the needs of the brothers and it fits in so nicely too with the existing building elevations.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:13.339
Yeah, I would agree, I would also recommend option B.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:18.339
Very good, then we'll go ahead and develop this clear story option in it.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:37.849
At all Bethel facilities around the world, regular maintenance saves money.

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:42.160
It keeps buildings and machinery in good order.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:52.970
Technicians and craftsmen work behind the scenes to keep the organization running smoothly.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.970
Many learn their skills after arriving at Bethel.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:05.180
Patterson, New York.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:11.180
Home to an educational center which promotes Bible instruction to the ends of the earth.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:23.519
This facility has schools for overseers of Jehovah's Witnesses who care for responsibilities in congregations, circuits, districts and branches.

00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:36.089
The intense Bible education these ones receive in class assists them to advance the preaching work in their assigned territories.

00:18:36.089 --> 00:18:45.089
Similar classes have been instituted in various countries for the benefit of traveling overseers regionally.

00:18:48.089 --> 00:18:55.089
These mature Christian men care for the preaching work in their respective branch territories.

00:18:55.089 --> 00:19:05.880
These classes ensure consistent Bible-based direction for millions around the globe.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.880
Another aspect of this facility is the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.880
Founded in 1943, it trains two classes of students each year.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:27.880
An intensive five-month Bible course prepares them for missionary assignments all around the world.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.880
The Temple is given to Ezekiel to pass on to the Jews.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:41.880
Gilead students share the results of their long hours of research by giving reports to the class.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:50.880
Gilead graduation at the Watchtower Educational Center.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:57.289
This is a special day for all in attendance.

00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:04.289
The preachy work is to prepare your heart.

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:12.289
If in your heart you really want to help people, you'll find a way to do it.

00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:21.079
Now from Belgium, we have Alar and Tamura Duman, and they're going to Indonesia too.

00:20:21.079 --> 00:20:28.079
These students and thousands like them have graduated from Gilead and have entered the missionary field.

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:33.079
This involves sharing the good news along jungle rivers of South America

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:43.089
and by flying into remote and isolated villages where interested persons are located.

00:20:43.089 --> 00:20:50.089
Here in this brochure, Bible truth seeps into far-flung regions.

00:20:50.089 --> 00:20:55.089
Indeed, to the most distant part of the earth.

00:20:55.089 --> 00:20:59.089
We would like to welcome the Bethel family to our morning worship.

00:20:59.089 --> 00:21:04.089
First, let's have the Scripture text read.

00:21:04.089 --> 00:21:13.089
A day at Bethel begins just as it does for many families of Jehovah's Witnesses all around the world, with a discussion of a Bible text.

00:21:13.089 --> 00:21:23.089
In today's text Jesus expresses His determination to finish God's work, and it's a privilege to participate in God's work.

00:21:23.089 --> 00:21:27.089
There is another part of the regular spiritual feeding program.

00:21:27.089 --> 00:21:32.089
Quiet places are found in Bethel libraries.

00:21:32.089 --> 00:21:40.089
I'd like to give a very warm welcome to all for our Bethel family watch star study this evening.

00:21:40.089 --> 00:21:48.089
At Bethel branches around the world, Monday night is set aside for the family watch star study.

00:21:48.089 --> 00:21:53.089
This helps them prepare for their own congregation needs.

00:21:53.089 --> 00:22:01.849
In their public preaching work, the Bethel family uses the very publications they have produced.

00:22:01.849 --> 00:22:04.849
In Brandon's my name and my friend Kurt.

00:22:04.849 --> 00:22:05.849
I'd like to ask you a question.

00:22:05.849 --> 00:22:08.849
Do you think the west of this is Justin?

00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:12.849
We've just been talking to people about stress.

00:22:12.849 --> 00:22:15.849
United States Bethel.

00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:20.480
Home to a large family.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.480
Who cooks the meals?

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.480
Wash is the laundry.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.730
Keeps house.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.730
How's it looking for you to sleep?

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.730
There's a lot of guests right now.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:32.730
Yeah, I can help with your life.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:42.369
Okay, thanks.

00:22:42.369 --> 00:22:46.369
In order for the Bethel family to make a neat appearance as ministers,

00:22:46.369 --> 00:23:03.490
tons of laundry are cleaned every week.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.490
Hard work makes for a hearty appetite.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:22.660
The kitchen fills the need with nutritious meals served seven days a week.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:38.660
Annual conventions are a spiritual highlight for Jehovah's Witnesses around the globe.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.660
They follow the Bible precedent set in ancient Israel.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:48.069
Arrangements for conventions begin with the convention department.

00:23:48.069 --> 00:23:51.069
Sound is so important at our conventions.

00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:56.069
Careful thought is given to convention location and size.

00:24:00.069 --> 00:24:05.069
Arrangements are made for these large gatherings in all parts of the earth.

00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:20.750
At times, delegates from other countries join local witnesses

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.750
for a truly international gathering that demonstrates the worldwide unity

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:32.099
found in Bible-based beliefs and morality.

00:24:32.099 --> 00:24:36.099
In addition to such large-scale annual conventions,

00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:43.099
periodically 10 to 20 congregations from a local circuit have one or two-day assemblies.

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:49.099
Here young and old alike share encouraging experiences.

00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:57.099
Sound Bible Council is given on a vast array of subjects

00:24:57.099 --> 00:25:03.099
so as to maintain a high moral standard to avoid common pitfalls of life

00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:09.099
and to strengthen family ties and marriages.

00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:13.099
Even more instrumental to the shaping of wholesome Christians

00:25:13.099 --> 00:25:16.099
are the regular meetings that are held three days a week

00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:21.099
in upwards of 100,000 congregations.

00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:23.099
How can you find the true religion?

00:25:23.099 --> 00:25:26.099
Would that be all right? Yes, that would be fine.

00:25:26.099 --> 00:25:30.099
Here, scriptural insight is given on a variety of topics

00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:35.099
so that all can benefit from theocratic ministry school education.

00:25:35.099 --> 00:25:40.099
The Theocratic ministry school book reminds us that what we say last

00:25:40.099 --> 00:25:42.099
is often remembered the longest.

00:25:43.099 --> 00:25:46.099
New congregations meetings, new ones can progress spiritually

00:25:46.099 --> 00:25:49.099
by studying the Bible with a mature Christian minister.

00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:53.099
Okay, Jordan, our question is why do you not need to fear

00:25:53.099 --> 00:25:56.920
making a dedication to God?

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.920
After thoroughly studying Bible standards and conforming their lives to them,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.920
new witnesses are baptized in symbol of their dedication to God.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:13.900
Not an end, but the beginning of an expanded ministry

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.900
sharing Bible truth with others.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.900
So please note, sir, that there will be a new earth,

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.900
a paradise earth.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:26.910
Well, men can enjoy living forever under God's kingdom.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:38.150
Imagine paradise restored on earth.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:41.150
Billions will be resurrected.

00:26:50.539 --> 00:26:53.539
They will need to be educated in God's ways.

00:26:54.539 --> 00:26:58.539
There will be much work to do to accommodate them.

00:26:58.539 --> 00:27:01.539
What a joy the new world will be.

00:27:01.539 --> 00:27:06.539
The spirit of peace and Christian brotherhood, earth water.

00:27:06.539 --> 00:27:26.200
Lift up your eyes and view the fields, said Jesus,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.200
that they are white for harvesting.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.789
Since the New World will be,

00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:38.789
the spirit of peace and Christian brotherhood, earth water,

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:42.519
for harvesting.

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:48.339
Since those words were spoken, millions have been gathered.

00:27:48.339 --> 00:27:55.150
And the harvest continues today.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:59.880
Who are included in the harvest?

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:06.640
Honest-hearted persons who long for better conditions on the earth.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.640
People who develop a genuine love for truth by earnestly studying the Bible

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.640
and sincerely applying its message in their daily lives.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.640
And as love of the good news grows,

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.640
so does the desire to share it with others.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.640
Jehovah's Witnesses, as an organization,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.640
are really quick to share the good news with people of all nations

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.640
before the end comes.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:52.700
To that end, the building of branch facilities,

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.700
assembly halls and kingdom halls,

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.700
has served to accommodate the influx of all those being taught by Jehovah.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:06.049
With God's new world so close at hand,

00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:11.049
it may be that many of these fine facilities will continue to be used

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:13.049
as centers of education.

00:29:13.049 --> 00:29:18.049
And this education will continue until the earth will certainly

00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:21.049
be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah,

00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:25.049
as though waters are covering the very scene.
