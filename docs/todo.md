# UI

## Main Page:

Category for newest videos
* As a carousel, below the big items

# Backend

## Cleanup

* API: Use helper functions for returning success and error (partially implemented)
* Make API paths consistent (eg, 'video' or 'videos', but not both)
* Consolidate functions/routes for APIs, and base them on method
</br></br>

## Database

**Data**
* Add URLs for videos
* Get date stamps for remaining videos
* Get profile pics for speakers
* Get profile pics for characters
</br></br>


## Correlation

Find similar videos
* Look at similar tags, speakers, characters, description
* Need to do research on how to do this best
* Add categories to the calculation
