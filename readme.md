# üöÄ Quick Start

There are two ways to run this application: using Docker or running it directly with Python.

Running as a Docker container is the recommended method, however it relies on you having a Docker environment set up.

Below are the instructions for both methods.
</br></br>


## Using Docker

Note: This assumes you have a Docker environment set up and ready to use.

Basic steps are:
1. Get the latest image from Docker Hub
2. Run the Docker container
3. Access the application in your web browser (port 5000 by default)

### Note on Local Database
This requires a local database to be mounted as a volume. This is to store user profiles and watch history. The app will create the contents of the file.

For this to work, you need to:
1. Create an empty file named `local.db` in the directory where you will run the Docker command.
2. Mount this file as a volume in the Docker container.
</br></br>

### Docker Scripts

**Linux:**
```bash
if [ ! -f "local.db" ]; then
   touch local.db
fi
docker pull lukerobertson19/1320:latest
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v "$(pwd)/local.db:/app/local.db" lukerobertson19/1320:latest
```
</br></br>

**Windows (Powershell):**
```powershell
if (-Not (Test-Path -Path "local.db")) {
   New-Item -ItemType File -Name "local.db"
}
docker pull lukerobertson19/1320:latest
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v ${PWD}/local.db:/app/local.db lukerobertson19/1320:latest
